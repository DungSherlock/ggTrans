Anita. I find that when I do
spluttering of the brass, if he

c7b0780f-4b47-4511-8f10-aff2f9387354-0
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:20.736
first you make sure you keep
your face slightly at 10:00 and

c7b0780f-4b47-4511-8f10-aff2f9387354-1
01:10:20.736 --> 01:10:24.940

So your focus should be home the
brat you do the fracturing and

021620e1-b80f-4e5b-8ef7-055b25820c8d-1
01:10:30.752 --> 01:10:36.016

01:10:36.016 --> 01:10:40.956
to points. Sharon is a Charu
breathing not a deep breathing.

021620e1-b80f-4e5b-8ef7-055b25820c8d-3
01:10:40.956 --> 01:10:43.710
And then do it as fast as you
can

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:49.395
and each time depends on your
your physical condition, your

d795f9ae-29f2-43c2-9167-b36c95a4c75b-1
01:10:49.395 --> 01:10:53.774
pathological condition. Every

01:10:53.774 --> 01:10:58.965
different. It is okay. You just
talk to the correct instruction

d795f9ae-29f2-43c2-9167-b36c95a4c75b-3

between your eyebrows and get
your breathing to a flutter.

d795f9ae-29f2-43c2-9167-b36c95a4c75b-5
01:11:08.453 --> 01:11:13.319
Flutter means both think and
outs down rapidly. Address the

d795f9ae-29f2-43c2-9167-b36c95a4c75b-6

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.102
Brinda. I get very out of breath
while fluttering. I hope you

f5cb65c9-cadd-4b1b-9e93-241ae79ccb84-1
01:11:23.102 --> 01:11:27.924

01:11:27.924 --> 01:11:32.668
because your inhalation and
escalation is not approximately

f5cb65c9-cadd-4b1b-9e93-241ae79ccb84-3
01:11:32.668 --> 01:11:37.254
equal. So you need to be
conscious to bring their balance

f5cb65c9-cadd-4b1b-9e93-241ae79ccb84-4
01:11:37.254 --> 01:11:41.445
between your inhalation and
affiliation. And you can

f5cb65c9-cadd-4b1b-9e93-241ae79ccb84-5
01:11:41.445 --> 01:11:46.505
continue for 3 to 4 minutes just
be a weather of the innovation

f5cb65c9-cadd-4b1b-9e93-241ae79ccb84-6

01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:14.570
Lutterman month of Margali
starts from 16th.

6ba3751c-61de-46b8-b256-d5a92e8dfc7e-0
01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.140
What is the significance of this
month?

900bcf59-39cb-46b9-a7c3-381924a52284-0
01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.743
It is a this time of the year
that the planet Earth is closest

900bcf59-39cb-46b9-a7c3-381924a52284-1
01:20:26.743 --> 01:20:27.540
to the sun,

afe897c4-c643-45ed-ac99-0b1ddddd9e3b-0
01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:34.500
so if this should have been the
hottest month. But this is a

afe897c4-c643-45ed-ac99-0b1ddddd9e3b-1
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:38.870
time when the planet is shy of
the sun and the northern face

afe897c4-c643-45ed-ac99-0b1ddddd9e3b-2
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:40.590
faces away from the sun.

fb2f66c2-8079-4770-a128-449c3dfd1505-0
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:44.140
In the Southern hemisphere, this
is the

7a608e63-973b-4cb4-923f-1fdb0bcc4b40-0
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:49.300
of the ENU Northern hemisphere.

4985c6fa-597c-4843-8ec1-a1079d8ffc08-0
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.480
This is the coolest part of the
year

8197ae3a-a913-4388-a3dc-60b8e28cc0f2-0
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:57.675
because the northern hemisphere
or the northern face of the

8197ae3a-a913-4388-a3dc-60b8e28cc0f2-1
01:20:57.675 --> 01:21:00.030
planet is facing away from the
sun,

fd595d64-e018-43e5-ab8d-b752bf834634-0
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:02.020
but it is closest.

723b5b15-11c2-44d7-b721-b8c6791f2994-0
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.030
So in terms of temperature.

611b5ebf-5265-4e06-aad3-63a5b223d2f6-0
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.350
Because of the closeness to the
sun,

1250ef5f-8ab5-4e93-b457-62b619f8450c-0
01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.323
the angle at which the sun's
rays hit the planet is very

1250ef5f-8ab5-4e93-b457-62b619f8450c-1
01:21:13.323 --> 01:21:17.322
diffused. But in terms of sun's
gravity functioning on the

1250ef5f-8ab5-4e93-b457-62b619f8450c-2
01:21:17.322 --> 01:21:20.440
planet right now, it is it is at
the highest.

9661579f-183f-4369-aeeb-e440eef23f1c-0
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.780
So the maximum pull of the

62c90b15-0826-4210-8edf-bee32f61e623-0
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:29.420
songs Gravity is functioning
upon the planet at this time.

1b391ab9-511f-4d7b-95b2-113e8d4cf0f3-0
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:35.890
So this Margali month is a time
to bring balance to the system.

dbf97a3d-1939-4db1-b4c7-a0b409cdd575-0
01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.786
It is like if something is
flying all over, if you just

dbf97a3d-1939-4db1-b4c7-a0b409cdd575-1
01:21:41.786 --> 01:21:42.350
pull it,

59baeeb6-0634-4854-998c-7944db14a54a-0
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:45.080
it gets centralised.

9e561264-0938-4641-a6f3-91d20e0ece5c-0
01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:50.183
So that is the effect that the
Margali month has on the human

9e561264-0938-4641-a6f3-91d20e0ece5c-1
01:21:50.183 --> 01:21:50.590
system.

864adf89-da6c-4f5a-b456-9b90212af75f-0
01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.670
It proves you from the base,

a45f58bd-03d8-4be3-8776-974aa760c3d6-0
01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.180
so it brings balance and
stability,

24ecb407-9131-4ef5-82e0-361e519fab5d-0
01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.300
recognising this,

c28ff4c5-c3f0-43bd-b24b-d860c5607c06-0
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.570
that one needs to bring balance
and stability. This is a time

19886e08-d89f-4933-bd20-17fb8f9e2ec2-0
01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:10.630
one. There are practices in the
yogic system

8bcd2e2b-282e-425a-ad93-41817b1154e7-0
01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:16.167
which is transmitted itself into
culture in many different ways.

8bcd2e2b-282e-425a-ad93-41817b1154e7-1
01:22:16.167 --> 01:22:20.743
This is a time when men will do
what generally what women are

8bcd2e2b-282e-425a-ad93-41817b1154e7-2
01:22:20.743 --> 01:22:25.320
supposed to do and women will do
what men are supposed to do.

20abd92d-9be4-491a-8d61-ecd1d7716557-0
01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.450
In the sense

7e008282-1e30-4c39-89eb-19a9976b49bc-0
01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.260
in Tamil Nadu there is a culture

f2c611e9-f88c-4bd8-b7e4-2e3df8d90c38-0
01:22:31.150 --> 01:22:36.320
that this is a time when men
will go on nagada, sang Kirtan.

b700507d-21c4-4e5f-9a18-8e7c66189e5a-0
01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:41.070
That means men will practice
devotion. They will sing.

8314bcfb-6106-4eb0-bf82-b60b049ac56a-0
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:46.984
Singing and devotion is largely
considered feminine, so men will

8314bcfb-6106-4eb0-bf82-b60b049ac56a-1
01:22:46.984 --> 01:22:47.970
practice this.

8156e0ed-c434-49c1-9d7b-0c693166113c-0
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.545
Women will practice making
geometrical figures. Geometry

8156e0ed-c434-49c1-9d7b-0c693166113c-1
01:22:54.545 --> 01:22:56.880
and masculinity are very

3fc927d6-1c7b-4e35-8bc9-862b010065d4-0
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:59.230
directly connected.

5a6cd758-3848-4218-9731-ade861aec442-0
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:06.195
If a woman sees something that's
not, say, woman. If feminine

5a6cd758-3848-4218-9731-ade861aec442-1
01:23:06.195 --> 01:23:08.530
sees something, it will always

1d469af1-1da7-41e7-be26-171775c4dc93-0
01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:13.630
pay maximum significance to the
colour and form of that.

9243181c-9c1e-436c-a17c-8ceedf33e464-0
01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:20.135
If the masculine sees something,
it always sees the geometry

9243181c-9c1e-436c-a17c-8ceedf33e464-1
01:23:20.135 --> 01:23:25.482
first and then the colour and
the form. So it is this month

9243181c-9c1e-436c-a17c-8ceedf33e464-2
01:23:25.482 --> 01:23:26.730
woman practice

8f47ac5a-adce-43b5-9baf-fbe5021eaa81-0
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:28.360
geometry

f9917b7a-d541-42cd-9147-01ecee412a30-0
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:33.450
not on paper, but in front of
their homes

cbe3fdd4-eca7-4b7f-81db-b80e807df88f-0
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:37.702
through the Margali month. Every
woman is supposed to draw

cbe3fdd4-eca7-4b7f-81db-b80e807df88f-1
01:23:37.702 --> 01:23:38.920
geometrical figures.

b90ced87-d654-404d-a46a-ef1e2c952136-0
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:43.360
Of course, today you have
templates. There are no good.

82e3cdc6-7470-4223-a91d-07ac53a05e49-0
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.080
You must practice geometry

322ad844-f59e-4d27-8b54-15b0a148d42e-0
01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:53.864
because shifting from colour and
form to geometrical shapes and

322ad844-f59e-4d27-8b54-15b0a148d42e-1
01:23:53.864 --> 01:23:54.400
forms.

2e5db3e7-d264-4da5-b900-82fbf9cfeded-0
01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:58.020
This is a simple

45081faa-c0d9-42ff-a88f-1cf728fd93e0-0
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:04.659
transformation of a certain
science into a cultural

45081faa-c0d9-42ff-a88f-1cf728fd93e0-1
01:24:04.659 --> 01:24:05.340
dimension

bb18e64a-0a82-4fc1-b91c-9d8069752a0e-0
01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:13.438
because of the closeness to the
sun. Because of a general pool

bb18e64a-0a82-4fc1-b91c-9d8069752a0e-1
01:24:13.438 --> 01:24:17.920
downward Muladhara becomes the
most dominant.

01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:23.795
Because Muladhara becomes most
dominant, the preservative

f1a1a497-6e76-47ff-b3a7-0e3a0a7303e0-1
01:24:23.795 --> 01:24:24.200
nature

4c223a46-1c81-43f0-a1fa-a684b12a4640-0
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.440
of life becomes dominant in the
body.

01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:33.495
In the yogic system we would say
when the preservation is

5220d7dc-778b-4162-a507-ead884930b5e-1
01:24:33.495 --> 01:24:34.260
dominant,

749c60e3-ca63-4e73-b4c9-a1abf82a3cd5-0
01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.790
this is not a time to grow.

74986583-9bf2-48eb-9217-33689d7bd619-0
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.582
All life in the northern
hemisphere is that its minimum

74986583-9bf2-48eb-9217-33689d7bd619-1
01:24:41.582 --> 01:24:45.924
right now? The growth of the
tree, the plant and if you plant

74986583-9bf2-48eb-9217-33689d7bd619-2
01:24:45.924 --> 01:24:50.126
a seed you can see this. The
growth will be slowest at this

74986583-9bf2-48eb-9217-33689d7bd619-3
01:24:50.126 --> 01:24:54.049
time, not only because of the
temperature, because of a

74986583-9bf2-48eb-9217-33689d7bd619-4
01:24:54.049 --> 01:24:55.590
general pool downward.

01:24:57.530 --> 01:25:00.710
So because the growth will be
very,

084e356b-08f3-429e-8884-e9829a12ab91-0
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:08.269
because the growth will be held
back because of a certain

084e356b-08f3-429e-8884-e9829a12ab91-1
01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:10.260
inertia in the life force.

33c2c3bf-bfc5-418f-b83c-eec489a4d26b-0
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:16.523
This is the time the body can
recoup itself. This is a time

33c2c3bf-bfc5-418f-b83c-eec489a4d26b-1
01:25:16.523 --> 01:25:19.150
body can preserve itself well.

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:25.010
The inertia caused in all
aspects of life

dfae766a-b7d7-42d2-8cb1-4dc29e61815a-0
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:30.170
because of the closeness of the
sun and being on the wrong side.

e2070bdd-f19c-4e49-a811-f1851adad07e-0
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:34.852
Everything being pulled down,
see it will not sprout very

e2070bdd-f19c-4e49-a811-f1851adad07e-1
01:25:34.852 --> 01:25:35.180
well.

eb363e9d-6786-4703-a315-99f68c81ce1a-0
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:41.571
Recognising this Margali, the
month of Margali, there never

eb363e9d-6786-4703-a315-99f68c81ce1a-1
01:25:41.571 --> 01:25:44.420
are any marriages in Tamil Nadu.

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:49.670
Still it is being maintained
because this is not a time

9920b8a7-a13f-46cd-9e8e-ed532610dc0f-0
01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:52.050
for conception.

870c874b-2083-4b1f-ab75-c3d6758ef70a-0
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:57.836
Even those who are in in the
life of householders, even a

870c874b-2083-4b1f-ab75-c3d6758ef70a-1
01:25:57.836 --> 01:26:02.698
grihasta practices Brahmacharya
for this. Generally it is based

870c874b-2083-4b1f-ab75-c3d6758ef70a-2
01:26:02.698 --> 01:26:07.180
on this. You see, people are
going to the hills 40 days of

870c874b-2083-4b1f-ab75-c3d6758ef70a-3
01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:11.510
Brahmacharya before they go
there, because this is not a

870c874b-2083-4b1f-ab75-c3d6758ef70a-4
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:16.448
time for conception, because the
seed will not sprout as well as

870c874b-2083-4b1f-ab75-c3d6758ef70a-5
01:26:16.448 --> 01:26:18.120
it would another time.

4e57cf78-abfc-433f-b9b5-d7fa62c4c931-0
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:24.260
So in the science of breeding
the right kind of human beings,

a693277b-06af-482c-b8dd-d7b670ee84c2-0
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:27.960
Margali is not the time to
conceive.

953498cd-0d5e-44e4-8344-78c676f9cea0-0
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:33.140
There are many aspects attached
to this.

edb73d09-6516-4981-8e84-3c55d5f3d98e-0
01:26:34.050 --> 01:26:37.742
We don't have to go by that
because it will develop a whole

edb73d09-6516-4981-8e84-3c55d5f3d98e-1
01:26:37.742 --> 01:26:40.450
prejudice against the December
born people.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.440
No, December born is not the
problem. December conceived?

cdf9b32f-d258-43bf-8f82-e22e95c5f4e8-0
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:50.770
Not necessarily so.

b5051ce1-4958-4802-be2e-5ea21522cddb-0
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.950
It is just that

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.280
to

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.750
sink our lives

01:26:58.590 --> 01:27:02.150
with the natural movements of
the Earth,

12aebbb3-cf29-46b8-8e53-e8711238717a-0
01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:08.322
to see that we ride the cycles
of this planet. We are not

12aebbb3-cf29-46b8-8e53-e8711238717a-1
01:27:08.322 --> 01:27:12.744
crushed by the cycles of this
planet in the process of

12aebbb3-cf29-46b8-8e53-e8711238717a-2
01:27:12.744 --> 01:27:13.869
evolving life.

02df9654-8fbc-4465-aefc-efee36377a39-0
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.036
When I say in the process of
evolving life, I'm not talking

02df9654-8fbc-4465-aefc-efee36377a39-1
01:27:20.036 --> 01:27:20.290
about

9b2ce823-eff4-434d-94c6-934ae50b6be0-0
01:27:20.890 --> 01:27:25.857
how to make monkeys into human
beings. I am talking about how

9b2ce823-eff4-434d-94c6-934ae50b6be0-1
01:27:25.857 --> 01:27:27.860
to make human beings into

9a31a21f-aed9-4e8f-bae9-bc99e5e43568-0
01:27:28.530 --> 01:27:30.190
better human beings.

a0936307-ba7f-4f28-b8d0-206db434517b-0
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:37.149
Better. Not just physically
better, not just mentally, but

a0936307-ba7f-4f28-b8d0-206db434517b-1
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:39.420
as a life, a better life.

ee0a403a-6a41-4e7b-bf5b-d95c6c21cb1c-0
01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:43.040
Oh, is one life better than the
other?

9ed9a0f1-4aff-47fd-9ab8-46b70c2bf2c9-0
01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:44.830
This is a

ab8937f3-caf1-437c-bc90-9e96327c86a1-0
01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.100
difficult thing, but

b3b5cb94-86e5-4ba4-8048-8e0e8828aa82-0
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:53.110
if you closely observe one life
to another,

07987698-bde1-42de-bb89-9bb8cb3ad31a-0
01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:58.143
you will see how one life
functions. Not in terms of

07987698-bde1-42de-bb89-9bb8cb3ad31a-1
01:27:58.143 --> 01:28:02.254
social actions, not in terms of
capability and competence.

07987698-bde1-42de-bb89-9bb8cb3ad31a-2
01:28:02.254 --> 01:28:06.575
Simply how life functions within
the system is different from

07987698-bde1-42de-bb89-9bb8cb3ad31a-3
01:28:06.575 --> 01:28:07.760
person to person.

8e0562d0-25a3-4ab8-89cf-9e9a7f5b724c-0
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:13.333
The system of yoga is seeing how
to make this life function.

8e0562d0-25a3-4ab8-89cf-9e9a7f5b724c-1
01:28:13.333 --> 01:28:17.116
Atheist people think highest
means will I be the most

8e0562d0-25a3-4ab8-89cf-9e9a7f5b724c-2
01:28:17.116 --> 01:28:21.529
successful person in the planet?
Will I run 100 metres ins for

8e0562d0-25a3-4ab8-89cf-9e9a7f5b724c-3
01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:22.439
many seconds?

d951bdd2-eeea-42fb-bb03-bfba11ea9110-0
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:28.667
Better does not mean that.
Better simply means as a piece

d951bdd2-eeea-42fb-bb03-bfba11ea9110-1
01:28:28.667 --> 01:28:30.520
of life it is better.

e881bb9e-e018-4895-91ad-be14476dd577-0
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.660
There is no context

8e26f94d-b49e-4bf4-9ebd-eaba4c6f3f1e-0
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:37.650
to speak about this dimension in
normal

154ce2e3-feaf-40e3-acc0-9f984a079b7e-0
01:28:38.530 --> 01:28:43.248
parlance or in English language
particularly. There is no way to

154ce2e3-feaf-40e3-acc0-9f984a079b7e-1
01:28:43.248 --> 01:28:48.038
say it because life is all same.
Yes, life is all same but it can

154ce2e3-feaf-40e3-acc0-9f984a079b7e-2
01:28:48.038 --> 01:28:49.199
function better.

00c11ab3-8281-4e8a-8ad7-0d49f2cb5a53-0
01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.497
If you allow it, it will
function better. If you do not

00c11ab3-8281-4e8a-8ad7-0d49f2cb5a53-1
01:28:53.497 --> 01:28:56.110
allow it, it will not function
as well.

01c1c839-b912-45ef-addb-0bac3e4db3b3-0
01:28:57.830 --> 01:29:02.357
Whether we like it or we don't
like it, that's how it is. One

01c1c839-b912-45ef-addb-0bac3e4db3b3-1
01:29:02.357 --> 01:29:06.738
the same. You must see there is
a beautiful example. In the

01c1c839-b912-45ef-addb-0bac3e4db3b3-2
01:29:06.738 --> 01:29:10.390
Spanda Hall garden we planted 2
nagalingam trees.

98775134-64ea-4125-a8d1-10e8080f2d24-0
01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:16.994
One we have taken care of them
equally well. One has grown and

98775134-64ea-4125-a8d1-10e8080f2d24-1
01:29:16.994 --> 01:29:19.850
flowered, other is always
struggling.

a1fe212f-ab65-41ec-b892-a7f242145b4f-0
01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.620
There are different reasons for
that, but it's like this.

87c9fc99-f73f-434d-97aa-21f5eaa5691d-0
01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:30.295
In the same home, 2 children are
born. One just flourishes within

87c9fc99-f73f-434d-97aa-21f5eaa5691d-1
01:29:30.295 --> 01:29:32.680
himself, another struggles all
the way

24a4710b-245a-447e-9f78-a1e9b76f4da3-0
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:39.110
because for life to happen, it
needs a conducive atmosphere.

8067c53f-e0c2-4b60-bd56-63c16863529d-0
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.741
Creating that conducive
atmosphere and allowing life to

8067c53f-e0c2-4b60-bd56-63c16863529d-1
01:29:43.741 --> 01:29:44.610
happen better

2482ea60-bfa3-4f65-942a-fa8fb01b8641-0
01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:49.690
this time of the year has
maximum possibility in this

2482ea60-bfa3-4f65-942a-fa8fb01b8641-1
01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:50.390
direction

0ef22117-3f95-47ed-b219-a185f0c6bf49-0
01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.870
you know about.

1dc71b5f-f96c-46aa-b52a-f4fc1a190b02-0
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:59.395
Definitely. You know about this
story of Bhishma waiting to

1dc71b5f-f96c-46aa-b52a-f4fc1a190b02-1
01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:03.766
cross this Dakshinayana
Uttarayana before he left his

1dc71b5f-f96c-46aa-b52a-f4fc1a190b02-2
01:30:03.766 --> 01:30:04.090
body

01354207-72eb-4b46-9dd4-69985ce5b281-0
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:07.620
because he wants to be

67eef517-5c0a-410d-95eb-fdaa2e7700af-0
01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:10.660
out of this pull to the South.

88d48a50-8adf-4846-942a-a145e2f87667-0
01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:16.224
South is called down is called
South. So if it is pulling down,

88d48a50-8adf-4846-942a-a145e2f87667-1
01:30:16.224 --> 01:30:19.862
the Mooladhara will be
strongest. The preservative

88d48a50-8adf-4846-942a-a145e2f87667-2
01:30:19.862 --> 01:30:24.142
aspect will be strongest. He
does not want to leave at that

88d48a50-8adf-4846-942a-a145e2f87667-3
01:30:24.142 --> 01:30:28.564
time. He wants the sun to move
away to a place where there is

88d48a50-8adf-4846-942a-a145e2f87667-4
01:30:28.564 --> 01:30:30.490
an upward pull to his body.

414326c9-199e-494e-a7d3-129846f7433b-0
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:36.623
There is an upward pull to his
being so that he can ascend in a

414326c9-199e-494e-a7d3-129846f7433b-1
01:30:36.623 --> 01:30:37.540
proper way.

956f6a7d-d097-42e9-9bdb-c260e415f2da-0
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:44.960
The Margali is significant for a
spiritual seeker because

d246eeab-2cef-4ac2-9d3a-466647297bec-0
01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:49.360
it brings a natural sense of
stability into the system,

8923d92f-afbc-4c52-95b4-fdc6ac39789b-0
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:53.215
particularly those who are
suffering from any kind of

8923d92f-afbc-4c52-95b4-fdc6ac39789b-1
01:30:53.215 --> 01:30:53.700
ailments,

23b76ee5-496a-46a6-b612-ac193591bfe5-0
01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:59.346
particularly psychological
imbalances. This is a good time

23b76ee5-496a-46a6-b612-ac193591bfe5-1
01:30:59.346 --> 01:31:04.284
to balance because the sun's
energy and the sun's gravity is

23b76ee5-496a-46a6-b612-ac193591bfe5-2
01:31:04.284 --> 01:31:08.089
pulling downward. One can
stabilise themselves

f2f1e60e-4c85-4842-b66a-bc94d3c5569e-0
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:10.990
stability

bcf7f905-73c3-4673-970e-a31b4c5a6b95-0
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.890
if you have pulled upward.

48c9f1c1-5f4d-4b40-a20d-4a8549a22324-0
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:26.617
So this is called as Sadhana
pada and this is the peak of

48c9f1c1-5f4d-4b40-a20d-4a8549a22324-1
01:31:26.617 --> 01:31:31.171
sadhana that if you do the
necessary sadhana at this time,

48c9f1c1-5f4d-4b40-a20d-4a8549a22324-2
01:31:31.171 --> 01:31:35.880
generally traditionally people
don't want to miss the Brahma

48c9f1c1-5f4d-4b40-a20d-4a8549a22324-3
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:40.589
Muhurtham in this month that is
at 3:40, they are all up and

48c9f1c1-5f4d-4b40-a20d-4a8549a22324-4
01:31:40.589 --> 01:31:44.990
there are various processes to
keep in touch with water.

dc01c734-f24e-42b4-a796-9a71211fced2-0
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:50.912
There are many systems and many
cultural practices and yogic

dc01c734-f24e-42b4-a796-9a71211fced2-1
01:31:50.912 --> 01:31:55.253
practices to keep in touch with
water. Because water is the

dc01c734-f24e-42b4-a796-9a71211fced2-2
01:31:55.253 --> 01:31:59.665
largest element within you and
water is one thing that could

dc01c734-f24e-42b4-a796-9a71211fced2-3
01:31:59.665 --> 01:32:00.100
slosh.

b40e217f-c9d7-441d-8222-d47f5a28c58b-0
01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:05.436
If your waters are not proper,
it will cause imbalance in the

b40e217f-c9d7-441d-8222-d47f5a28c58b-1
01:32:05.436 --> 01:32:05.900
system.

aad20d88-468f-4814-ad9e-90da1e32a9ab-0
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:08.660
In the yogic system,

6e1c1739-a98f-4460-93fc-3d72df5d709b-0
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:14.573
if there is a psychological
imbalance, it is always seen as

6e1c1739-a98f-4460-93fc-3d72df5d709b-1
01:32:14.573 --> 01:32:17.300
water element going out of
control.

2eac0f38-77c8-4545-bf60-088a99512ebc-0
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.328
Because if you have a tank full
of water and shake it, it will

2eac0f38-77c8-4545-bf60-088a99512ebc-1
01:32:23.328 --> 01:32:27.606
slosh. If you have a tank full
of sand or mud, it will not

2eac0f38-77c8-4545-bf60-088a99512ebc-2
01:32:27.606 --> 01:32:32.246
slash the same way. So the water
element is what causes various

2eac0f38-77c8-4545-bf60-088a99512ebc-3
01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:36.887
levels of imbalance in a person
if the right kind of things are

2eac0f38-77c8-4545-bf60-088a99512ebc-4
01:32:36.887 --> 01:32:38.120
not done with it.

a8bccb0d-9d0c-4507-9436-027ae9bb8918-0
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:43.235
So traditionally there are
various practices to be in touch

a8bccb0d-9d0c-4507-9436-027ae9bb8918-1
01:32:43.235 --> 01:32:48.028
with water. One of the simplest
thing is people always went into

a8bccb0d-9d0c-4507-9436-027ae9bb8918-2
01:32:48.028 --> 01:32:52.380
Temple pond at 3:40 in the
morning to take a dip. It would

a8bccb0d-9d0c-4507-9436-027ae9bb8918-3
01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:52.970
be good.

4106ca7b-40e6-4854-a166-ca9e005e88f5-0
01:32:54.630 --> 01:32:59.284
We should we should keep our
Tirthika open early this month,

4106ca7b-40e6-4854-a166-ca9e005e88f5-1
01:32:59.284 --> 01:33:03.786
from 16th to 13th or 14th of
January. We must keep it open

4106ca7b-40e6-4854-a166-ca9e005e88f5-2
01:33:03.786 --> 01:33:08.441
very early. Those who want to
make use of it can make use of

4106ca7b-40e6-4854-a166-ca9e005e88f5-3
01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:08.669
it,

56ec4ede-b720-4560-ab02-6b3ba3723db5-0
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.190
bringing stability to the waters
within

0fb9a0e0-8abf-4b13-bca1-c53440454b2e-0
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.020
psychological balance.

346d97e3-a6ee-4c78-8adc-73656236e050-0
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:24.265
Only when there is psychological
balance and physiological

346d97e3-a6ee-4c78-8adc-73656236e050-1
01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:27.550
balance and energy balance will
you dare to climb

d54afa9d-f62b-4235-b7a9-c96a2549a3b3-0
01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:30.010
otherwise

303c59ca-1c61-4d7e-a742-b328d29b0bb9-0
01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.352
a little. One step. If
everything shakes inside of you,

303c59ca-1c61-4d7e-a742-b328d29b0bb9-1
01:33:34.352 --> 01:33:38.115
you will only step backwards
there. Any number of spiritual

303c59ca-1c61-4d7e-a742-b328d29b0bb9-2
01:33:38.115 --> 01:33:42.128
seekers who are constantly one
step forward, one step backward,

303c59ca-1c61-4d7e-a742-b328d29b0bb9-3
01:33:42.128 --> 01:33:45.640
one step forward, one step
backward, because the moment

303c59ca-1c61-4d7e-a742-b328d29b0bb9-4
01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.529
they take a forward step, they
will notice imbalance and they

303c59ca-1c61-4d7e-a742-b328d29b0bb9-5
01:33:49.529 --> 01:33:50.470
will come back.

b56f1bf7-719a-4a20-b7b2-070c4434ef0a-0
01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:56.382
This is happening to too many
people because not enough

b56f1bf7-719a-4a20-b7b2-070c4434ef0a-1
01:33:56.382 --> 01:34:00.784
sadhana towards stabilising
themselves. This particular

b56f1bf7-719a-4a20-b7b2-070c4434ef0a-2
01:34:00.784 --> 01:34:05.422
month offers a phenomenal
opportunity to stabilise oneself

b56f1bf7-719a-4a20-b7b2-070c4434ef0a-3
01:34:05.422 --> 01:34:09.825
because of the way the
relationship between the sun and

b56f1bf7-719a-4a20-b7b2-070c4434ef0a-4
01:34:09.825 --> 01:34:13.991
the Earth is such that it
creates maximum stability.

b56f1bf7-719a-4a20-b7b2-070c4434ef0a-5
01:34:13.991 --> 01:34:18.630
Stability also means inertia.
It's not mobile, it is table

2729986c-203e-4ef5-a358-0062ebb24bb1-0
01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:23.999
so it causes a certain level of
inertia and also stability. So

2729986c-203e-4ef5-a358-0062ebb24bb1-1
01:34:23.999 --> 01:34:28.712
this month is used for stability
and the next month the Thai is

2729986c-203e-4ef5-a358-0062ebb24bb1-2
01:34:28.712 --> 01:34:32.836
used for mobility. If you have
created enough stability

2729986c-203e-4ef5-a358-0062ebb24bb1-3
01:34:32.836 --> 01:34:37.328
stability within you, then only
you would dare to be mobile.

2729986c-203e-4ef5-a358-0062ebb24bb1-4
01:34:37.328 --> 01:34:41.378
Only if you are riding a
bicycle, only if you are well

2729986c-203e-4ef5-a358-0062ebb24bb1-5
01:34:41.378 --> 01:34:45.797
balanced will you dare to move.
Otherwise you will sit on a

2729986c-203e-4ef5-a358-0062ebb24bb1-6
01:34:45.797 --> 01:34:48.079
bicycle with the stand on. Yes,

b38ad3c4-7bd7-4592-966c-bf82ed0799ea-0
01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:52.710
yes, that's how life is
happening for lot of people

b38ad3c4-7bd7-4592-966c-bf82ed0799ea-1
01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:55.489
because of the fear of
instability. They sit on a

b38ad3c4-7bd7-4592-966c-bf82ed0799ea-2
01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:56.990
bicycle. With the stand on,

4952d3b1-2723-443f-b6ce-04e31744e5a6-0
01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:01.172
you can paddle, you can get some
exercise, but you're not going

4952d3b1-2723-443f-b6ce-04e31744e5a6-1
01:35:01.172 --> 01:35:01.650
anywhere.

c8508b7c-cf8f-4643-8639-3c849507577f-0
01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:09.843
Sumangali is a blessed month
which is used for various

c8508b7c-cf8f-4643-8639-3c849507577f-1
01:35:09.843 --> 01:35:10.780
processes

1c9e4336-2cc1-4162-a2d8-6f350526d863-0
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:16.566
across the Shiva temples in the
South. There are various events

1c9e4336-2cc1-4162-a2d8-6f350526d863-1
01:35:16.566 --> 01:35:17.100
happening

d378949b-126d-405c-80b4-9d5bbab3694c-0
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:22.290
on 16th, 17th, 18th of this
month.

3da31525-259c-41c1-966b-db325419b635-0
01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:30.031
The one important step is the
Arudra poojas that happened.

3da31525-259c-41c1-966b-db325419b635-1
01:35:30.031 --> 01:35:31.950
Rudra means a roller,

2c730ff3-715b-43e6-a881-0e3ac155b768-0
01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:34.970
somebody who

6f125a00-babd-423c-a049-f8f53603b475-0
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:41.250
who is very effervescent more
than effervescent a roar.

983c74e0-d696-4c14-afac-6a00ec9bd37c-0
01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.090
Arudra means stable,

918d4595-51c8-45ec-9df1-5b3c36447904-0
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.450
not roaring.

dbd58e7d-64c6-43b4-8155-27aee67f62e3-0
01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:55.847
Arudra also suggests a certain
inertia because rudra suggest

dbd58e7d-64c6-43b4-8155-27aee67f62e3-1
01:35:55.847 --> 01:36:00.955
movement and creation. Arudra
suggests no movement and a

dbd58e7d-64c6-43b4-8155-27aee67f62e3-2
01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:05.705
certain inertia. There is
inertia. There is enormous

dbd58e7d-64c6-43b4-8155-27aee67f62e3-3
01:36:05.705 --> 01:36:07.050
inertia in this

f1b1551f-df40-4c70-bc46-da4410b19715-0
01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.540
part of the ear, but

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:15.310
the wise should make use of
whatever there is,

7de9af9e-b540-4fba-9252-1711713fb8a0-0
01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.326
and we need a certain level of
inertia to bring stability. When

7de9af9e-b540-4fba-9252-1711713fb8a0-1
01:36:20.326 --> 01:36:24.704
you want to bring stability, The
thing is to slow down. If you

7de9af9e-b540-4fba-9252-1711713fb8a0-2
01:36:24.704 --> 01:36:27.970
lose balance, the first thing is
to slow down.

d28626c9-9a23-4ea8-af15-f890e19b9356-0
01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:32.885
So this is a time when
everything slows down and people

d28626c9-9a23-4ea8-af15-f890e19b9356-1
01:36:32.885 --> 01:36:37.413
want to make use of it and that
is why this Margali has become

d28626c9-9a23-4ea8-af15-f890e19b9356-2
01:36:37.413 --> 01:36:38.420
significant in

7ed19ae2-2619-401e-a14d-32c089c23fc3-0
01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.630
in a spiritual seekers life.

5958e67b-67cc-46e5-b02f-24ae3c60cab5-0
01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:50.674
You are my perfect Meri. You
show me what I am in the end

5958e67b-67cc-46e5-b02f-24ae3c60cab5-1
01:36:50.674 --> 01:36:54.090
this spell one one was

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:37.052
and midnight sathyakala? You
should avoid doing the practice

f45b5e7a-c25f-4ac2-8a3f-62fb5b2007b9-1
02:12:37.052 --> 02:12:39.680

02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:57.119

02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:10.018
Today I'm struggling with the
focus. So when you are doing the

952a4625-30d3-4ba1-9edf-f6a2ec4978c9-1
02:16:10.018 --> 02:16:15.006
Shambhavi, when the time that
you are aware that your focus is

952a4625-30d3-4ba1-9edf-f6a2ec4978c9-2
