1
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,040
Every culture has invested

2
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,520
a certain amount of energy

3
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,480
and a certain amount of attention

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
and certain significance

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,840
to dreams.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,760
Native American traditions

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,600
have invested

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,160
some amount of focus on dreams.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,120
They see it as an extension of reality

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,880
which is not all wrong.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
They seek practical and spiritual guidance

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,360
which may not be all wrong.

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm saying this

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,280
because they are deeply involved in

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,480
occult processes.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,400
We have seen the powerhouse of Mato Tipila

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,680
which is of Vishuddhi.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,000
People who are empowered by that,

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,400
in a way,

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,840
they transact between

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,120
life and death,

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,520
dream and wakefulness

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,840
a little more easily.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,960
They talk about dream as a connection
between

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,080
physical and spiritual world. 

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,360
Not entirely wrong.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,320
That depends on

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,840
what you call as spiritual.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,680
Right now, there is so much imagery

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,960
behind me in the form of these murals.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
Well, if

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,840
you look at these images -
you must understand

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,880
these images are of a certain culture,
of a certain tradition,

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,800
which points towards spirituality.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
It is not spirituality per se.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,000
If you go at what is spiritual,

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,120
purely spiritual,

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,000
then all this, not necessary.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,400
But you need inspiration.

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,600
You need to handle your psychological
and emotional

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,000
turmoils that go on within you.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,120
If you’re still there,
then you need this tradition.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,760
You need this culture to support you,
to remind yourself of people who...

44
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,760
how they transcended these

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,800
impediments within themselves

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
and how they rendered themselves
to higher possibilities.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,840
In that sense, as a process,
as a larger process,

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,400
yes, it is true.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,680
Dream and spirituality

50
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,800
- there is.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
But one who

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,080
strives to become absolutely

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,080
conscious or aware,

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,480
for that

55
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,800
person 
all these things are irrelevant.

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,320
Irrelevant.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Well, Shiva, Sati, Parvati,

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,960
this, that, their dance, their this thing
and the drama around them

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,960
not relevant for a person
who is purely conscious.

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,400
But very relevant for somebody who’s still

61
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,440
trying to...

62
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,800
not scale some other height

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
but trying to get across their own
physiological

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,200
and psychological impediments
- very, very relevant.

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,880
So in that context, dream

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,920
and spiritual dimension

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,080
have a relationship and dreams could have

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,120
consequences

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,360
in how one’s
psychological structure shapes up.

70
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,800
Because of that, it could in
turn have impact

71
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,000
on how one's physical life

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
takes shape,

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,760
very possible.

74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,320
But dreams are not messages

75
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,240
coming from somewhere.

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
It is about

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,240
your un-blossomed intelligence

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,480
trying to figure things out,
trying to touch dimensions

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,720
which are not in your experience.

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Well,

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,080
if you consciously seek those things

82
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,120
or if you try to induce these things,
dreams,

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
if you bring lucidness to your dream

84
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,560
using chemicals or -

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,080
because in this country,
you have to spell it out

86
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,760
chemicals or herbs or weeds or

87
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,440
buds or stems or roots (Laughter)

88
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,160
or the bark of a tree (Laughter),
I don't know.

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,640
Or a toad's back legs (Laughter).

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,120
If you're using any of them,

91
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,840
then you could be on a ride forever

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,760
not knowing which is which

93
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,800
because you just woke up

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
and sunlight

95
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,040
fell upon you, you're also feeling good

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,840
today. 

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Everything...

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,600
All your faculties are at their best.

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,000
If now you can't see what you need to see,

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,520
you seeing when you're exhausted,

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,800
when you're fast asleep and exploring

102
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,840
dimensions of consciousness

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,320
or dimensions of reality or mysticism

104
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,240
in a state of exhaustion
and unconsciousness,

105
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
well, I can't say too

106
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
much because too many people are involved
(Laughs).

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,920
Well, I would just say all the best.

108
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,800
I hope you have a long life
because you will need a very long life.

109
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
The Native American people

110
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,440
also have a term called Dream Walker.

111
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,360
One who can control their dreams

112
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,640
or some kind of play, a liaison

113
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,520
between physical and metaphysical worlds,

114
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,040
they took the services
of powerful dreamers

115
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,640
during dead winter when food was scarce.

116
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,120
Because these are hunting and gathering

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,440
tribes,

118
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,720
in winter times
finding food is a challenge

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,640
so they hired or employed

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,800
strong dreamers who could dream

121
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:12,480
where the hunt is.

122
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Fifty percent of the time they're right.

123
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,920
But above all, a human being is capable

124
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,720
of developing a sense
to where something is,

125
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,240
simply by being a little more conscious,
which they might have done.

126
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,640
People
might have thought he's dreaming it up.

127
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,720
Maybe he had a little extra sense

128
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,040
that he could figure out certain movement

129
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,880
and he's able to say that. 

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,120
I must tell you, in India

131
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,680
there are snake
charmers (Laughs), even today.

132
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,280
They live around the yoga center,
a whole tribe of them.

133
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,240
You call that guy,

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
he will come, in one afternoon, 

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,880
you tell him in this area

136
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,200
whatever snakes are there, clean it up.

137
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,840
He will go sit in one place
and start mumbling (Laughs)...

138
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,120
You know,

139
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm talking about this

140
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,080
because I've been humiliated by these guys

141
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,080
(Few laugh).

142
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Because

143
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
I've been

144
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,840
meddling with snakes
since I’m six, seven years of age,

145
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,360
and I could walk into the forest
and smell it out

146
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,080
and figure it out where the cobras are.

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,480
I would exactly know under
which rock it is, and I would pull it out.

148
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,040
But I have to go in search of them.

149
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
I have to go,

150
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,560
look for signs in the land
if they have moved or smell

151
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,120
and figure it out.

152
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,400
Well,

153
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
I would say

154
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,760
when I thought it's here,

155
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,440
at least sixty percent of the time,
I was always right.

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm saying a little more
than a flip of a coin.

157
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,040
Not guesswork. This is a calculation.

158
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,480
This smell, this thing and this hole,
this, this, this - he must be here.

159
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,400
But forty percent of the time he is
not there.

160
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,120
He's gone somewhere else.

161
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,320
But this guy just come and sits there
and starts mumbling something.

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,640
I don't know what the hell he mumbles

163
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,080
and snakes cannot hear.

164
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,880
You know that. They’re stone deaf.

165
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,200
But in an afternoon
he will catch twenty-five snakes.

166
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,080
They'll all come.

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,840
When I sat silently
meditating, they came,

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,440
but they came out of their sense.

169
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,640
I didn't know why they came.

170
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,160
I couldn't make them come.

171
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,320
They came looking for me.

172
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,840
But he makes them come.

173
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,000
And the guy, if you give him

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
twenty-five rupees, fifty rupees, he's
happy and he’ll take it and go.

175
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,280
This guy. 

176
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,000
So I felt humiliated that (Laughs)
I have to go

177
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
put my hand under the rocks
and search out risking a bite.

178
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,760
But this guy just sits there
and mumbles around.

179
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,640
It all comes to him.

180
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,120
And snakes are stone deaf,

181
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
so they can't hear his mumbling.

182
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,120
Maybe he's just mumbling and bumbling
to just set himself

183
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,760
into some space,
but they'll come for him. 

184
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,600
Maybe there were people like that
in the tribes

185
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
that they knew where the buffalo is or
the buffalo came for them, we don't know.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,160
Possible.

187
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,440
But all these things are put under dream,

188
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,240
they're being called Dream Walkers.

189
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,320
I wouldn't put this under dream,

190
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,600
but I think in these cultures

191
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,960
we don't know what local words they had.

192
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,920
But when western interpreters came,
anything that they cannot perceive,

193
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,120
they cannot logically think through,

194
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,040
probably
they put it all this under dream category.

195
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,840
So there are many rituals which create

196
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,760
dream-like
altered states of consciousness.

197
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,880
There are vision quests
which involve prolonged

198
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,040
fasting, drum beating, dancing,

199
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,720
flesh sacrifices

200
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,400
and of course, certain plants

201
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,360
like Peyote, Ayahuasca,

202
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,840
and the famous Sun Dance.

203
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,960
All this created

204
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,400
a dream-like situation.

205
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,840
Probably

206
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,920
when somebody loses a little

207
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
control

208
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,120
over their normal sense of logic,

209
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,320
that could be considered a dream.

210
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,760
I wouldn't say it's totally wrong.

211
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,480
But I don't think

212
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,040
today in the population, in the societies,

213
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,000
people understand dream in that context.
