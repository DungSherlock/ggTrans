00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.490
Let's understand the word yantra.

40380970-ba13-4071-872e-38a277873870-0
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.090
Yantra literally means a form or a complex arrangement of forms.

1e4c7812-1580-4813-b167-4bd4afa4b092-0
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.690
Or in today's language, the word yantra means a machine.

74007757-2345-49d9-83ed-bbd298e53cb4-0
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.010
Isn't body a machine?

e1a89393-f2a4-41f1-8355-d3fcdb89aecd-0
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.170
HM isn't this body a certain kind of machine?

f9fb0ff0-5b2b-40a8-9a9b-61c4e34c0f9e-0
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.310
No, no, no, sadhguru, this is me.

993ccd9e-a3f7-49db-b5a1-2b0c092120a3-0
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.590
All right.

caabe6ef-be11-481f-a1ea-e3942e9ec745-0
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.756
But tomorrow if you go to your doctor, he opens up this opens

caabe6ef-be11-481f-a1ea-e3942e9ec745-1
00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:06.550
up that says this needs to be fixed.

1a151598-710b-422e-8532-5da33af21fcb-0
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.643
That need to be fixed, whether you like it or not, It is a

1a151598-710b-422e-8532-5da33af21fcb-1
00:01:12.643 --> 00:01:13.470
machine.

940d5c3d-9df5-4b65-8bf4-53c2e06af175-0
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.849
It is such a perfect machine that you forget that it's a

940d5c3d-9df5-4b65-8bf4-53c2e06af175-1
00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:20.470
machine.

0a6a1383-30d3-48f0-bb78-5fc2100ccd5f-0
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.552
But if you forget to gas it for three days, then it tells you

0a6a1383-30d3-48f0-bb78-5fc2100ccd5f-1
00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:27.970
you're out of gas.

67ba48ea-9a78-477c-a975-1428ae94ff9c-0
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.450
Yes or no.

852e3390-7492-45e7-82d5-bb4e3a0f4d31-0
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.850
If you want a quick realization, hold your nose.

f2e575e9-9cd2-410b-bab3-d045fb2d4b12-0
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.770
In a minute, it'll tell you I'm out of gas South.

65002ee9-af4c-4ca5-bf8d-1d81773c60f4-0
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.930
This is a machine, so it is a yantra.

2409050c-6f0a-4506-b4e2-503afa3dab52-0
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.607
Now, for what purpose a particular machine functions

2409050c-6f0a-4506-b4e2-503afa3dab52-1
00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:53.890
depends upon how it is designed.

3a4959d5-4f7f-4211-bd4f-26569b91a956-0
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.271
There is a, you know, a grinding machine which is created for

3a4959d5-4f7f-4211-bd4f-26569b91a956-1
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:06.570
grinding flower or something like this.

5dda763d-be25-4044-a2b7-53ba12b0ff8c-0
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.436
There is an automobile, which is another kind of machine which is

5dda763d-be25-4044-a2b7-53ba12b0ff8c-1
00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:12.610
used for transportation.

262401c3-dbda-4ce6-a299-af5d6d7b7407-0
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.730
There's another kind of machine which we call a computer.

7eb77736-7132-4635-b9cf-2ec5e56e38fd-0
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.250
There's another kind of machine we call a spacecraft.

9e8d9be7-c7b8-4b3e-a767-85aa2c75dcd2-0
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.746
There's another kind of machine we call a solar system, another

9e8d9be7-c7b8-4b3e-a767-85aa2c75dcd2-1
00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:24.392
kind of machine we call a universe, another kind of

9e8d9be7-c7b8-4b3e-a767-85aa2c75dcd2-2
00:02:24.392 --> 00:02:25.970
machine we call a whole cosmos.

57f0d0ca-704a-473c-b0fc-a2c6e4464938-0
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.060
Everything is a certain geometrical arrangement of

57f0d0ca-704a-473c-b0fc-a2c6e4464938-1
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.490
forms.

dd42dbf8-ec32-40c7-9884-0ef42466cd0c-0
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.200
When they all fall together and function in a certain way, they

dd42dbf8-ec32-40c7-9884-0ef42466cd0c-1
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.610
fulfill a certain purpose.

d33e12a2-dc12-4a2a-b755-71e526cec1b0-0
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.410
This is a machine.

950ab4f1-6993-43d7-b31d-ea9936fea033-0
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.090
The same thing is true with this.

f07dfbfa-8ac8-401b-b9ba-51e5e6a34502-0
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.930
This is a machine.

cbd111fc-90a8-4f98-a9da-8f13db0b51e3-0
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.210
Now, what kind of machine do you want to be?

8ddf29ab-0704-4ab9-9a1b-391dc08ea17b-0
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.630
Do you want to be just a eating, sleeping, reproducing and dying

8ddf29ab-0704-4ab9-9a1b-391dc08ea17b-1
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.460
machine?

04fb9c96-6d12-4e27-827b-560f3566d448-0
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.740
Or do you want to be a machine which exudes something else?

67e342a9-9fbf-4399-8ab9-e5227d77a969-0
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.582
Do you want to be a machine which becomes a big possibility

67e342a9-9fbf-4399-8ab9-e5227d77a969-1
00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:06.820
for every other machine which is here?

073d4895-f40c-460e-8381-1bc1ade856ac-0
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.380
So accordingly you gear up the machine, tune the machine.

e53f22f4-c87b-4e8b-91b5-32294f4b3675-0
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.180
So this is a certain kind of machine.

f126cda8-05c5-4504-aba3-3990960a6c0b-0
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.980
This is an evolving machine.

7f0f0f9b-de3b-4693-8b48-a5e4add2569e-0
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.234
If you want from your birth to death, you can every day evolve

7f0f0f9b-de3b-4693-8b48-a5e4add2569e-1
00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:26.620
this machine into a different possibility.

25e1256b-4124-428d-b385-ae16191ce83d-0
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.388
There are many ways to look at it because you're referring to

25e1256b-4124-428d-b385-ae16191ce83d-1
00:03:32.388 --> 00:03:33.180
the Yantras.

23b30e2d-6afb-4672-9184-0909fe30c62e-0
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.321
And today when we say yantra, generally we're talking about

23b30e2d-6afb-4672-9184-0909fe30c62e-1
00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:40.580
energy forms, energy machines, not physical machines.

ebc90c85-91f3-4176-a280-805fefa43100-0
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.380
So this has an energy dimension to this machine.

0aa365fa-7e74-4823-b1e6-8175e9084ce4-0
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.132
This in Yoga we call Pranamaya Kosha energy system comprises of

0aa365fa-7e74-4823-b1e6-8175e9084ce4-1
00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:58.124
114 junction boxes or junction junction points or major meeting

0aa365fa-7e74-4823-b1e6-8175e9084ce4-2
00:03:58.124 --> 00:04:03.461
and mingling of what we call as Nadis or the channels or

0aa365fa-7e74-4823-b1e6-8175e9084ce4-3
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:05.240
pathways of energy.

ea42e135-f5a4-47ef-8881-f92dbfd1951b-0
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.706
These 114 are referred to as the chakras 114 chakras in the

ea42e135-f5a4-47ef-8881-f92dbfd1951b-1
00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:18.183
system and these are not geographically fixed in

ea42e135-f5a4-47ef-8881-f92dbfd1951b-2
00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.190
location.

3920c773-8f4a-4530-bc57-a0b8e127293d-0
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.347
You can move them, you can move them to different parts of the

3920c773-8f4a-4530-bc57-a0b8e127293d-1
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:28.470
body for different purposes of activity and doing things.

a72ec023-140c-469b-b489-0b595c5ac5f9-0
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.532
If you do not have mobility in your energy system, you will be

a72ec023-140c-469b-b489-0b595c5ac5f9-1
00:04:33.532 --> 00:04:35.390
mediocre levels of action.

42dacf6a-ea43-40e0-875f-74021c6bb49c-0
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.950
You will never rise to a different level of activity.

0c0f7398-c97c-4d6b-96a4-30b7eed05abd-0
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.247
First of all, if you want to create an energy form which

0c0f7398-c97c-4d6b-96a4-30b7eed05abd-1
00:04:46.247 --> 00:04:49.464
you're referring to as right now, the Bhairaviyantras have

0c0f7398-c97c-4d6b-96a4-30b7eed05abd-2
00:04:49.464 --> 00:04:51.099
become very, you know, people.

a5ed89c1-1142-4e69-9c7b-dad6c2d68d27-0
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.892
Many people's lives transformed simply because of this many

a5ed89c1-1142-4e69-9c7b-dad6c2d68d27-1
00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:58.445
homes and the space in which the live is transformed simply

a5ed89c1-1142-4e69-9c7b-dad6c2d68d27-2
00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:00.340
because of a simple energy form.

0b6a62d5-0354-4a28-9b28-4eefb6ea3ebb-0
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.213
If you want to create something like that, first of all your

0b6a62d5-0354-4a28-9b28-4eefb6ea3ebb-1
00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:08.580
energy should be mobile.

8249c70d-48fc-4acc-8136-b02a41376222-0
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.555
If there's no mobility in your energy system, if you cannot

8249c70d-48fc-4acc-8136-b02a41376222-1
00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:17.398
move your chakras where it is necessary at a given point,

8249c70d-48fc-4acc-8136-b02a41376222-2
00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:20.380
there is nothing you can impart on anything.

235c4030-aea6-4625-ab2e-29ec756c07ab-0
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.300
Right now there's a consecration process going on.

aeeefed8-7560-4253-8b56-9a26afb2d75e-0
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.980
We are consecrating the Bhairavi Devi for the Salem Temple.

ef4963b8-2f4e-4f5c-bb6f-163fe875710c-0
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.960
It's going on 24 hours I'm not there 24 hours in the shrine.

0f538e39-bb11-49a0-8863-2bbc738934fd-0
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.425
I'm there when I'm necessary physically, otherwise I'm not

0f538e39-bb11-49a0-8863-2bbc738934fd-1
00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:44.880
there.

e116dc09-4520-4f9a-80b7-6cf586a188ff-0
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.400
But it's on.

339bd23e-3cbb-4780-b7cf-b2524e1fc282-0
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.597
Because those of you who who have known me in different kinds

339bd23e-3cbb-4780-b7cf-b2524e1fc282-1
00:05:53.597 --> 00:06:00.115
of situations or in different kinds of states, if you observe

339bd23e-3cbb-4780-b7cf-b2524e1fc282-2
00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:07.053
closely, you would see something of Maine is missing right now in

339bd23e-3cbb-4780-b7cf-b2524e1fc282-3
00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:13.570
the last 25 days or 30 days, because one part we kept in this

339bd23e-3cbb-4780-b7cf-b2524e1fc282-4
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.250
line just to keep the thing going.

fac87ad6-c8a2-4af8-8215-eb3f6d0115f8-0
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.650
This is good.

1053806d-794b-423a-a17a-2ee0c514551d-0
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.010
This is OK for a period of time.

dbfe0994-9823-40ab-9042-4ef41c6e2d0d-0
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.185
If you do it for too long, it will Causeway damage to this One

dbfe0994-9823-40ab-9042-4ef41c6e2d0d-1
00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:26.530
South.

c6a516d1-bc13-4683-820b-b4c3fbbc7f4e-0
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.095
You want to finish it within a certain space of time, but

c6a516d1-bc13-4683-820b-b4c3fbbc7f4e-1
00:06:30.095 --> 00:06:33.414
unfortunately the physical arrangements of life don't

c6a516d1-bc13-4683-820b-b4c3fbbc7f4e-2
00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:34.460
always cooperate.

ca462230-2d3a-4495-9617-c7fdcf22c7c7-0
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.220
People around you do not cooperate.

1545238c-310a-4173-bdaf-804ae3b27e2a-0
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.276
So many things happen and I thought 11-12 days we'll finish

1545238c-310a-4173-bdaf-804ae3b27e2a-1
00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.700
this, but now it's already over 2526 days.

eb010cc2-f69d-4e71-a47d-ff7c33925816-0
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.660
We will close it in the next few days.

45ed00d4-2b6e-4bcf-992b-ad4acfa7fc70-0
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.244
But a part of your energy body is engaged in something, it'll

45ed00d4-2b6e-4bcf-992b-ad4acfa7fc70-1
00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:54.980
it'll do its own thing, energy wise.

5bd7ca25-2d28-4cdd-a034-16e10497e0ff-0
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.285
Even if you're sleeping, your energy is functioning, otherwise

5bd7ca25-2d28-4cdd-a034-16e10497e0ff-1
00:06:58.285 --> 00:06:59.270
nothing would function.

541e676d-880e-49a1-b08b-86b85ff28305-0
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.710
All right?

5d8c7cfc-db5d-4944-a821-4e60bc27bc85-0
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.910
HM your thought is not functioning.

04b1c363-9ac0-42e7-ae76-f57b8b785948-0
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.310
Your emotion is not functioning.

7432e616-01ec-4ebb-b9d9-9d290aa691b4-0
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.670
You're not conscious, but your energies are functioning.

2069df6d-24b4-4b78-a072-c9ea344bd6a5-0
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.670
That is why everything is happening.

05fe55bb-a63b-4e3e-86ec-7f355ea6555b-0
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.148
Heart did not stop beating, or the liver function did not stop,

05fe55bb-a63b-4e3e-86ec-7f355ea6555b-1
00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:16.626
or nothing in the body stopped because the energy body is still

05fe55bb-a63b-4e3e-86ec-7f355ea6555b-2
00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:17.550
alive and active.

a2ec7b62-96d2-43dc-9bb7-594cb7067c6e-0
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.002
Similarly, a part of the energy body, if you leave it somewhere,

a2ec7b62-96d2-43dc-9bb7-594cb7067c6e-1
00:07:22.002 --> 00:07:25.150
it's on by itself and it'll do what it has to do.

803fec3d-4823-4a08-a8a4-44c7b921d301-0
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.315
But if you do it for too long, it will Causeway damage to the

803fec3d-4823-4a08-a8a4-44c7b921d301-1
00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:33.071
mother body or for lack of words I'm saying mother body or the

803fec3d-4823-4a08-a8a4-44c7b921d301-2
00:07:33.071 --> 00:07:36.588
the main part of the energy system will get damaged if you

803fec3d-4823-4a08-a8a4-44c7b921d301-3
00:07:36.588 --> 00:07:37.900
leave it for too long.

b90ef616-c73c-4600-b325-0647a350d23f-0
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.700
Which?

3afa95aa-4b3b-4d6e-8727-cd54cd9e8d7a-0
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.500
Which?

297a1e75-842c-4a6d-9721-0de78202ce9b-0
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.627
Which happened in a serious manner when we were doing the

297a1e75-842c-4a6d-9721-0de78202ce9b-1
00:07:44.627 --> 00:07:47.300
dhyanalinga process because we played too much with it.

66e693c1-238e-4cb3-b574-4abb41645e8e-0
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.116
But importantly, how to transform your own body into a

66e693c1-238e-4cb3-b574-4abb41645e8e-1
00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:04.550
powerful yantra?

ed283079-721b-4f11-a177-2b3ec0408599-0
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.310
It is a yantra even now.

96aebc7e-69ce-468e-ad64-ac6e701ddc91-0
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.030
Let's recognize that even now it is a machine.

66eed70d-1143-465c-844a-f96df8835e2f-0
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.990
It is a physical machine, an intelligent machine and an

66eed70d-1143-465c-844a-f96df8835e2f-1
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.070
energy machine at the same time.

a9f850cf-480e-49e3-a559-fa2bc639d621-0
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.070
But for what purpose are you just here?

0d7502f0-8412-4bdf-a75c-bca84aac5ffd-0
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.190
You must understand you may think you're doing many things.

73d101aa-dc11-4e7e-85aa-2b6473061c08-0
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.702
All that's happening is physically, if you do not

73d101aa-dc11-4e7e-85aa-2b6473061c08-1
00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:30.592
explore other dimensions of life, after you're dead, if

73d101aa-dc11-4e7e-85aa-2b6473061c08-2
00:08:30.592 --> 00:08:33.510
somebody looks, what is it that happened?

f7df43cb-685f-44a6-a906-472b31ae8d72-0
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:39.020
If you have left a couple of children, that's the only thing

f7df43cb-685f-44a6-a906-472b31ae8d72-1
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.350
that's happened.

ab26e773-3edc-4ee9-a339-547c67fbfed3-0
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.310
You perpetuated human race.

71c7ff4e-916b-496e-a8b1-9f8df0ef2c74-0
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.510
Beyond that, nothing else happened.

7ef93d81-2017-474d-9330-91f9d37daf45-0
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:45.990
Why?

5be1f3da-e002-407e-8d6f-eb9be83958ec-0
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.470
People have always been desperate to have children.

786a86a8-3022-4eff-b777-42c9049143d7-0
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.630
It's just this because that's the only thing they can do.

0eb6c31d-9aef-42e2-b5b5-46bff3f577d6-0
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.030
Ultimately rest is all arrangements around that.

475060a4-43b0-483d-97cc-60d09f18a509-0
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.030
Please see this.

308401cb-320d-4e6a-b3ea-a69d8b3fc6ea-0
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.912
The only thing that unfortunately they are capable

308401cb-320d-4e6a-b3ea-a69d8b3fc6ea-1
00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:05.110
of doing is reproduction.

edeb26bd-2b05-4801-b760-ba75b2cc207a-0
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.830
Beyond that, nothing else has touched their life.

55a08e09-c697-4b85-8cc3-5368a65e7b2b-0
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:14.147
So you can be a reproducing machine or you can become a

55a08e09-c697-4b85-8cc3-5368a65e7b2b-1
00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:15.870
meditative machine.

0111194a-aaf6-48a1-bb12-b8e05ef2cc55-0
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.550
You can become a a phenomenal mystical machine.

d4195af7-705f-4006-94a4-5e17e2ed3b9f-0
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.960
Just a little rearrangement of parts.

1413199f-41ca-4323-81f2-0f864862d10d-0
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.760
The same gear wheels, the same turning things.

55a192b2-96d5-4c5e-8be9-77323e0a6809-0
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.080
If you put it one way, it is a devious moped.

65953445-24bb-4e8d-8c87-12df20c9ae0f-0
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.200
If you put it another way, it's a racing machine.

a9f3f254-3d52-42ea-89b3-73a850bb6e9f-0
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.640
If you put it another way, it's a flying machine.

5b6ea9f7-1e3f-464c-a804-b86cea6e28b0-0
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.630
Same things, isn't it?

a285f7d7-acad-4b90-9b11-8d1ac50659f1-0
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.190
Just arrangement is changing.

9d1fc195-d1b4-4eb8-9d69-488ab05cc571-0
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.363
Similarly with this, if you change the arrangement of your

9d1fc195-d1b4-4eb8-9d69-488ab05cc571-1
00:09:45.363 --> 00:09:49.630
energy body, if you change the arrangement of this 114 chakras,

9d1fc195-d1b4-4eb8-9d69-488ab05cc571-2
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.430
this can become many different things and this must be a

9d1fc195-d1b4-4eb8-9d69-488ab05cc571-3
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.430
planned change.

f637b675-5cca-415f-bfab-a0df7e162221-0
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.590
This must be a knowledgeable change.

a144a444-4804-403f-a478-8ebb462ffc65-0
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.464
If you simply wildly change it can, it can lead to many things

a144a444-4804-403f-a478-8ebb462ffc65-1
00:10:01.464 --> 00:10:03.230
which are not necessary.

8fe3b353-cbfc-40d8-87e9-7c223deab18d-0
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.769
What I'm saying is, if you make certain arrangements with your

8fe3b353-cbfc-40d8-87e9-7c223deab18d-1
00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:14.420
energy system, you can become like a full-fledged demon.

81800f54-4b44-438b-8af7-9fd9b555b991-0
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:22.267
You can, if you arrange it in a certain way, you've become a

81800f54-4b44-438b-8af7-9fd9b555b991-1
00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:24.980
full-fledged divine entity.

1d4bd8f0-64ba-4dc9-ade8-6325a69b9297-0
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.372
If you arrange it in a certain way, you become a mystical

1d4bd8f0-64ba-4dc9-ade8-6325a69b9297-1
00:10:28.372 --> 00:10:28.780
process.

bc97ffb1-c7c6-4f5b-a77b-e46703a56a4a-0
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.717
Wherever you walk, things will happen in ways people have not

bc97ffb1-c7c6-4f5b-a77b-e46703a56a4a-1
00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:33.860
imagined possible.

e2592f27-1af2-40dd-a3bb-43c037e23aed-0
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.140
It's all a question of how you arrange this.

57f19432-2bca-464e-84a0-708de81055a3-0
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.420
Am I a yantra?

318cfd1a-fd1d-46b2-969d-afe498a41b4f-0
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.620
Yes, you are a yantra.

903767d9-5233-41ee-997e-a1a3d03061b1-0
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.020
Are you a reproducing yantra?

f5646c20-bf1c-48df-bfca-af6a7c83f473-0
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.938
Are you an intelligent yantra, or are you some other kind of

f5646c20-bf1c-48df-bfca-af6a7c83f473-1
00:10:55.938 --> 00:10:56.420
yantra?

5beabb6e-2aec-41d1-b973-21217d668ae0-0
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.140
Is a question of arrangement.

a0ea00dc-11ab-4d6a-a6c5-bfe5336d917d-0
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.214
So even the physical manifestation of outside yantras

a0ea00dc-11ab-4d6a-a6c5-bfe5336d917d-1
00:11:03.214 --> 00:11:08.407
that we are creating is just a certain arrangement of a few

a0ea00dc-11ab-4d6a-a6c5-bfe5336d917d-2
00:11:08.407 --> 00:11:09.100
chakras.

fff19107-82ff-4fb0-a068-c12447bd8de7-0
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.460
No yantra is 114 chakras except this one.

ac993124-b103-4483-b034-4be472796f52-0
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.220
It is full-fledged.

cd5cd384-e23d-4fbc-813a-a90f3a05808f-0
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.428
Why Dhyanalinga was such a challenge is it's a full-fledged

cd5cd384-e23d-4fbc-813a-a90f3a05808f-1
00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:19.780
yantra.

88991cda-aaeb-43bf-8a93-a09eca9939e0-0
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.640
Everything else is a small arrangement, but it's specific

88991cda-aaeb-43bf-8a93-a09eca9939e0-1
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.620
because it's specific goals.

ca9879ab-2d11-466b-8a0f-430abeb5f777-0
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.820
It looks far more impressive.

f9b14308-cb2d-4ed6-9767-1cb2fa5595e9-0
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.553
I'm sure a whole lot of people will vouch that their Bhairavi

f9b14308-cb2d-4ed6-9767-1cb2fa5595e9-1
00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:49.396
Yantra at home, their Avigna Yantra at home is far more

f9b14308-cb2d-4ed6-9767-1cb2fa5595e9-2
00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:51.180
powerful than Dhyanalinga.

845554c1-4074-422f-b896-956bd050f151-0
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.914
That will be their experience because that Yantra is tuned or

845554c1-4074-422f-b896-956bd050f151-1
00:11:55.914 --> 00:11:59.760
attuned to their body and their being because of that.

5f880036-5778-4cff-af4e-b092ac6fc141-0
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.680
They feel that way.

56f8221d-70a7-441c-9e97-b68b16ca307d-0
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.996
But if somebody attunes himself or herself with the annalinga,

56f8221d-70a7-441c-9e97-b68b16ca307d-1
00:12:04.996 --> 00:12:07.880
then it's a different experience altogether.

fcd0b793-632b-4ebb-b207-582db3e63b55-0
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.219
It obliterates you completely as a person and delivers you into a

fcd0b793-632b-4ebb-b207-582db3e63b55-1
00:12:12.219 --> 00:12:13.880
completely different space.

a652f1cf-fd7d-4ef2-9cab-564399ace378-0
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.771
This is the only Yantra right now of all the Yantras we have

a652f1cf-fd7d-4ef2-9cab-564399ace378-1
00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:21.280
created, which is all 114
chakras.

3ac2ffb0-23b0-42ad-9baa-63cb080dfd01-0
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.411
A full-fledged being, rest or certain arrangement made for

3ac2ffb0-23b0-42ad-9baa-63cb080dfd01-1
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:27.880
specific purposes.

d73e30eb-edba-43ba-ae1b-3c8a46e9e496-0
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.840
This is an ultimate machine in this solar system.

d9d351b5-340d-44a5-b5b4-92684d94374e-0
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.317
Human system is an ultimate machine with all the

d9d351b5-340d-44a5-b5b4-92684d94374e-1
00:12:37.317 --> 00:12:38.960
possibilities open.

c733b00f-5f4a-4c7f-aa67-ba121d4bf1ad-0
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.720
Exploring this or not exploring this is an individual thing.

c2197450-d33b-4cd7-91be-e1a7ceb7f850-0
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.840
Why is it One person seems to come to it easily, another

c2197450-d33b-4cd7-91be-e1a7ceb7f850-1
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.287
person seems to struggle with it is simply depending upon right

c2197450-d33b-4cd7-91be-e1a7ceb7f850-2
00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:58.900
now what is the fundamental arrangement within you.

bce5ded4-219b-4e67-873e-bbc540a59d9e-0
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.900
Accordingly, it takes time.

1642f3bb-4339-4108-bd24-b0aece7c099b-0
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.340
How flexible are you as a as a person, as a this thing?

db4a9fe3-f64a-4bc0-a15d-7185100a96f4-0
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.220
How willing are you Is fundamentally the question.

1c034655-92fd-41ec-8897-aa2b36e107c9-0
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.420
If you are absolutely willing right now, we can arrange.

92bbe5c4-0674-48a3-9648-f71adce3915e-0
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.100
We don't even have to do any practice right now.

7a6f38a9-a20e-4739-aa79-071c88245a52-0
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.713
I can arrange it for you just like that, if you're absolutely

7a6f38a9-a20e-4739-aa79-071c88245a52-1
00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:20.180
willing.

ec54289f-2ab5-4730-b148-757cf433139c-0
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.130
Willing means you must understand.

6df39456-e5e7-4eec-bca7-0d0ecd61a52b-0
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.810
Being truly willing means you have no will of your own.

5eb41fc1-d580-4826-9c8c-d6339f56de91-0
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:32.057
If you sit here for a moment without any will of your own,

5eb41fc1-d580-4826-9c8c-d6339f56de91-1
00:13:32.057 --> 00:13:36.050
transformation can be done without any practice.

013e4b2a-3e27-4ce3-9d9c-f237cad3d36d-0
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.114
Practice is only to sustain the change because again, you may

013e4b2a-3e27-4ce3-9d9c-f237cad3d36d-1
00:13:40.114 --> 00:13:41.250
twist yourself out.

63ed2049-4c8f-4c3d-b672-e689c9003b2b-0
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.930
So the practice is the spiritual.

192bef91-2088-46f2-807a-20d0147366ae-0
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.476
Sadhana is to create a foundation in the physical body

192bef91-2088-46f2-807a-20d0147366ae-1
00:13:48.476 --> 00:13:51.250
so the distortions will not happen easily.

6cd5336a-4ac0-4397-ae70-b2bbca46f4fa-0
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.130
Life situations can freak your energy system.

debd1224-255d-4e28-af94-c547eee1aab3-0
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.850
You walk into your place.

3fe630c1-b856-4796-b7e7-7d092944d00a-0
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.970
You walk into your life situation.

b86214af-34fe-46da-943f-4030946fc643-0
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.770
You walk into certain emotions.

dcb080fb-b508-4a1e-b483-0c47c3a4408a-0
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.730
You walk into certain physical situations.

545c77df-a9ad-4295-ad56-5e559c4da9e3-0
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:09.058
The very way you are can change positively or negatively

545c77df-a9ad-4295-ad56-5e559c4da9e3-1
00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:12.070
depending upon what influences you.

fdef894b-6cba-4d3b-a4db-5f38c96bdbc4-0
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:17.431
So the physical sadhana of the yogic practice is to establish a

fdef894b-6cba-4d3b-a4db-5f38c96bdbc4-1
00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:22.353
body which becomes slowly, less and less available to all kinds

fdef894b-6cba-4d3b-a4db-5f38c96bdbc4-2
00:14:22.353 --> 00:14:23.429
of influences.

b4a9fb8a-c3df-4229-855c-9093d471a15d-0
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.688
You have a stable platform upon which if we build something, it

b4a9fb8a-c3df-4229-855c-9093d471a15d-1
00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:28.630
stays that way.

b109b321-e99b-4d22-8b3a-d2717bb8bd75-0
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.830
How many of you have not noticed this?

47d12090-a1b9-4f5c-8fe1-4a8b6d477bcb-0
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.236
First day we've initiated you into Sonia meditation or

47d12090-a1b9-4f5c-8fe1-4a8b6d477bcb-1
00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:34.790
Shambhavi.

cb30a0cb-fd14-4749-aa32-7e41ee2262dc-0
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.550
You thought, oh, this is it.

66545101-6b54-44bb-b6b2-7e7b33d0f533-0
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.750
I have arrived tch.

f95d63e1-23ee-41af-b52e-739baff05da3-0
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:48.510
But in two weeks time you had all your problems again.

242120b3-80fc-44a6-9623-74bbcba2f017-0
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.150
Not because now Shambhavi is not working.

62d6caa9-8c21-45bc-8bec-e29bdeed8d14-0
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.100
Simply because you don't have stable enough platform to hold

62d6caa9-8c21-45bc-8bec-e29bdeed8d14-1
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.710
up this wonderful structure we created for one day for you.

8373e381-e574-484c-a452-42afd80ee6fe-0
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.730
You have to work, create a stable platform.

90204276-9328-4514-b97c-f8e19e09f035-0
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.761
Otherwise, if the platform is not stable enough, it doesn't

90204276-9328-4514-b97c-f8e19e09f035-1
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.494
matter what kind of a fabulous structure you build, it's not

90204276-9328-4514-b97c-f8e19e09f035-2
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.330
going to stay for a long time.

1f992b82-c1d1-48e6-807c-03df45a07c38-0
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.370
It'll keep crumbling.

63ac1a82-209f-4941-ad07-c6a6dd64b1b4-0
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.580
So daily sadhana is it's crumbling and you want to keep

63ac1a82-209f-4941-ad07-c6a6dd64b1b4-1
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:17.890
it up.

385d6904-3829-4213-bc9c-e9e830cbf913-0
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.690
You want to crumbling and you want to keep it up.

b0e166c8-7ff1-4750-8027-5a973e897e12-0
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.810
First thing is to bring stability.

dfb6a7dd-c7e0-4919-8578-d276df49b760-0
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:28.250
We want to see how we are right now working on almost 190

dfb6a7dd-c7e0-4919-8578-d276df49b760-1
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:34.760
children for whom we are working to establish a very stable body.

340e6d62-b64e-43f3-95b6-37fb2a009946-0
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.360
We will have to watch and see what wonderful things will

340e6d62-b64e-43f3-95b6-37fb2a009946-1
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.668
happen out of this, because once somebody has such a stable body,

340e6d62-b64e-43f3-95b6-37fb2a009946-2
00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:58.520
we can do things which will not get distorted very easily.
