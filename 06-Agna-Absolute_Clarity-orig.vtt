00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.399
Sadhguru, can you tell us what is the path of Sahasrar? 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:27.199
Have there been Yogis who belong to that tradition?

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.479
The Sahasrar is total madness. 

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:40.200
Those of you, who've been in Bhava Spandanas, 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.840
may be - not all the time, after, 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.679
in those three-and-a-half days of pain and suffering  

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:56.159
there might have been moments… 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.880
there might have been moments, or a few moments, where

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.280
you seemed to be dripping something too pleasant, you're dripping ecstasy, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.439
but, of course, you felt battered, 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.879
that is we're trying to counterbalance so that you don't remain in the program forever.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.359
So, you might have felt a few moments because energies have touched Sahasrar. 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:39.200
The moment energies touch Sahasrar, without any reason, you drip ecstasy. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.840
Sahasrar is not a path. When we use the word path, 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.760
it means a demarcated way, an established way. 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.000
Something is demarcated. To demarcate, you need a physical space. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.759
Without a physical space, you cannot demarcate. 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.159
So sahasrar is not a physical space, 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:22.800
In the geography of the body, it has a physical presence but it's not a physical space,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.479
it does not represent a physical space. 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:33.039
Because of this, there is no path. There're any number of 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:41.639
indications about this, there are any number of examples in the tradition.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.960
Probably one dramatic example 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.639
would be of Totapuri and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:03:01.560
Ramakrishna, who was a bit too much into sahasrar, wouldn't have lasted long because 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.639
that is not a space where one can hold onto physical body and exist. 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:13.039
As ecstatic and fantastic as it is, it is not a living space, 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.639
it is a going space. 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.639
Once in a way, you can touch it and be back. When somebody 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.599
stays there for too long.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.680
things will happen, body won't hold. 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.759
So, you've heard of Totapuri taking a piece of glass and 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.879
cutting his agna to bring him down 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.840
to clarity and to knowing, rather than simply floating around in ecstasy.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.039
Is floating around in ecstasy not good? It's great 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:55.039
but you cannot work in that condition, you cannot manifest something 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:04:01.360
in that condition. That condition is like inebriation. 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.759
It is wonderful, existentially fantastic, but

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:14.319
in terms of human activity, it's not great 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.439
because you cannot be functional in those states. 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.879
Even if you're functional, you're not very effective. 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:28.240
It's a fuzzy world between physical and nonphysical. 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.680
So, the less we say about sahasrar, better because 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.560
right now we are on a mission. we can't afford fuzzy world. Here and there, 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.759
we party a bit. 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.600
We have our Bhava Spandanas, we have our satsangs, 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.040
and here and there we party a little bit. But then we want to be down

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.879
and be focused on what we need to do 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.079
because that will not be possible if everybody is in sahasrar. 

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:16.120
And if everybody starts inhabiting there, 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.040
they won't be here for long, they'll be gone. 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.839
In India, there is a certain symbolism of amrita coming out of the ocean, 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:35.759
Shiva drinking up the poison part of it 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.240
and everybody wanting to drink the amrita or the elixir of life 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:49.519
and between two groups of... 

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:56.040
between those two groups who are fighting to drink amrita and make themselves immortal, 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.199
all that stuff. Essentially, 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:08.920
amrita is immortality, in the sense 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.639
that your experience of life rises beyond physical. 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.399
When your experience of life rises beyond the physical, 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:21.879
you're obviously immortal in some way. 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:27.800
Immortality does not mean we will have to endure you forever. 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.160
It means that we don't have to endure you at all because 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.240
your physical nature is almost gone. So, 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.959
to put it in terms of chakras, it's sahasrar. So what you're seeing as a... 

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:49.839
a third day moon is 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:56.480
a drip of this. Three drops of amruta  dripped out 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.639
of Shiva's sahasrar and everybody is trying to access it.

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.079
He is wearing it as an ornament. 

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:13.759
This's important. He is wearing it as an ornament, sitting on his head.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.160
That means there is a tinge of ecstasy, always 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.240
but he is not immersed in it. Sometimes he goes into it, but

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.199
otherwise there is always a tinge of ecstasy.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:34.959
If there is no this tinge of ecstasy, one cannot sit. 

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:38.959
One can sit simply here 

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.360
without any need to do anything outside, 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.199
without the need to pursue pleasure or fulfillment 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:53.040
because there is a tinge of ecstasy. If

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.519
That means you're mildly buzzed out. If you're fully drunk, 

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:02.399
then you'll be useless. When I say useless, 

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.079
in terms of the world, not in terms of life. 

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:11.120
In terms of life, that is also okay. But in terms of activity in the world, 

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.360
you could become incapacitated. 

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.959
But with a tinge of ecstasy, now 

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:25.319
you can be into endless slavery, 

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:30.000
that you can do any amount of things and still feel you've done nothing 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.960
because there's a tinge of ecstasy. It is like people who get little drunk,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.159
they dance and dance and dance till their legs fall off. 

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:46.279
They wouldn't be able to do that at other times because there's a tinge of ecstasy. 

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:50.399
So, you can either dance, or work, or do whatever, 

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:54.440
create something, without any sense of burdensomeness

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.480
because there is a tinge of ecstasy.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.120
So Shiva is representative of this,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.559
Adiyogi is representative of this, that always there is a tinge of ecstasy…

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:09.279
As I said, if you're well-established 

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:12.960
and there is a tinge of ecstasy, it's fantastic. 

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.360
But if you only seek that, 

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.759
it's still fantastic but a rather bit too fantastic, 

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:25.519
that it may become... 

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:30.960
you may move from reality to another fantastic world. 

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.840
Right now la-la land has become a famous term once again. 

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.799
so you may be little la-la – wonderful for you, 

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:48.120
but needs to be rooted in this world 

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.879
because there are things to be done here too.

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:56.879
You've heard about Shiva being in ecstatic states, when he's inaccessible 

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:00.039
and unavailable. And someone 

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:06.039
who is so focused and intense, suddenly is all woozy-woozy, 

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:11.799
that he's not available. That's because these are sahasrar times, 

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:17.279
when even someone as intense and focused as him 

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:24.600
is too drunk, too inebriated for action. 

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.279
As you know, of all the…If you…

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:33.919
Of all divine entities, probably – not probably, is 

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:41.039
Shiva is the most athletic. That means he signifies action. 

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:46.120
But he gets woozy sometimes because he's in sahasrar. 

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.720
So it is not a path. You go to sahasrar because you want to get lost, 

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.200
not you want to find yourself, you want to just get lost. 

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.840
So when you feel like getting lost – sahasrar. 

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.000
When you feel like finding yourself, you need to be on some path. 

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:18.840
Is there a tradition of getting lost? Yes there is but you can't make a form out of it.
