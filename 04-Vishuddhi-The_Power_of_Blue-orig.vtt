00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:21.760
Vishuddhi, as I've said many times, essentially means a filter. 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.559
Vishuddhi is one dimension…that we normally skip, 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:38.679
because, if you become active in Vishuddhi, one dimension of this is, 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.159
that you become occult competent.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.600
Occult essentially means, if your 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.960
energies are centered in Vishuddhi, or reasonably some mastery over your Vishuddhi, 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.079
you start functioning in a…different level of competence 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.079
that people around you think you are super human. 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.200
But all that's happened is, you have accessed other ways to function. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.920
So, in many ways, Adiyogi is a representative of that,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.640
so representative of that, that there are so many names, 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.599
which are around his Vishuddhi. 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:24.200
He's called Vishakanta, he's called Neelakanta, 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.840
like this, there are many names representing him as an embodiment of Vishuddhi,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.640
not because that's the only quality he had, 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.040
people recognize only those things, because something 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.799
beyond their understanding happened.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.560
See. if you say Jesus, we don't know what all he did, 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.280
they didn't record what he said, what he did, 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.560
but if you say Jesus, first thing will…people will say is, "He walked upon water." 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.920
Like that, Shiva is…Adiyogi, or Shiva is famous, 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.400
for things that he did, which other people thought are impossible, 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.439
or beyond normal capability. 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.280
So, people started recognizing him for his Vishuddhi capability, 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.439
his other capabilities were too subtle for them to notice, 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.800
something beyond their understanding, 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.199
what they thought was normal, should happen. 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:35.680
So, something weird should happen. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.039
Vishuddhi…

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:47.120
If you put people on the Vishuddhi sadhana, you will develop a lot of weirdoes. 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.919
Weirdo means just this 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.240
you every day scraped your face, somebody did not. 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.800
in your understanding, he's a weirdo...Let's say one society developed 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.680
this habit or this tradition, or a sacred tradition that

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.439
if nose is cut off when the child is born, 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.080
you…the child will inhale, and as an adult also you will inhale 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.039
twenty-two percent extra oxygen. 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:28.840
Much healthier, much better, 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.560
you won't need a tissue. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.599
eco-friendly it is. Many things, hmm?

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.840
So, if this happened - suddenly if one person came with a… intact nose, 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.400
suddenly he will look like a weirdo. Yes or no?… 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.960
If one's Vishuddhi becomes active, 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:06.240
these kind of energy capabilities will come through which one can create many things. 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.080
It's very important, if one wants to transmit 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.800
and transform the situations around them, 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.959
having a certain capacity of the Vishuddhi is very very important. 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.759
But, if one is focused on Vishuddhi, 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.319
it's a little hard for them to fit into the social structure. 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.839
You have definitely heard of stories of Adiyogi, 

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:39.120
sometimes he is very resplendent, magnificent, 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.720
representation of a male person, 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.000
some other times he is all weird, and crazy, and like that 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.319
these descriptions are talking about the different states in which they saw him. 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:59.639
When they saw him in Vishuddhi, he was in the cremation ground, weird 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.360
the weirdest of the weird. He had the Ganas around him, and every 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.399
kind of being, because this is one thing that'll happen, 

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:15.399
the moment Vishuddhi is active, disembodied beings will naturally move towards you.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:20.120
When we were consecrating Dhyanalinga, 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.000
I was preparing people for different chakras, but Vishuddhi is 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.519
one thing I could not train anybody for, 

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:39.800
because we didn't have anybody weird enough. 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.160
We had weird people, but not weird enough 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.879
for a quick transformation the time… having the time 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.000
constraints, the kind of time constraints we had at that time. 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:58.240
So I decided to use a certain disembodied being,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.160
a Yogi who has has attained to a certain level, 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.720
strong in the Vishuddhi, so we decided to use him. 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.279
The moment we started doing this, 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:18.360
one thing is, one particular cobra,… 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:25.560
we're about four-hundred people gathered in the night, 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.639
and he just… we don't know how he crawled through this 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.600
crowd, nobody noticed him,  

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.560
and he comes there, 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.399
and comes into one small pit that I have made to do 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.240
something, he comes and sits in that pit. 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:57.279
Then I see this guy is trying to have a free ride with me. 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:02.839
then I pick him up and put him in a bag, and tell them, "Go, leave him in the forest." 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.959
So they put him outside and come, another few hours, again 

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:09.879
he's back there in the same pit.  

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.879
He wants to be there, because he sees it's his chance, 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:20.399
you see? Around his neck also, 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:23.800
all this symbolism is a science 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.399
of trying to give you a certain language 

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:31.600
it's a certain map of how to go, how things happen.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.480
When I used to meditate for long hours, 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.519
I either sat in…sometimes in Chamundi Hill, otherwise there's a small forest 

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:46.399
called Aloka in Mysore, when I sat there, 

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:50.519
I don't know why I always chose afternoons, I never sat in the morning, 

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:55.639
sometimes late nights, but, mostly in the afternoons, for some reason. 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.680
If I sat in the afternoons and meditated for a few hours and opened my eyes, 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.240
there would be twelve-fifteen cobras in front of me, all sitting 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.800
there and waiting for a free ride. 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.839
The moment Vishuddhi becomes active, 

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.399
they will be there. 

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:18.000
That is the significance that it's around his neck, because Vishuddhi is active, 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.279
the symbolism or the imagery is trying to say, 

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:27.439
"His Vishuddhi is so active, the cobra won't leave his neck, it's right there." 

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:31.759
Disembodied beings will naturally come - once again, 

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:35.440
Vishuddhi is something that we normally skip with most people, 

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.279
because one who is looking for realization, 

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:42.679
he need not go through all these works. 

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:47.279
But one who wants to explore the technologies of life, 

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:51.960
one who wants to transmit, one who wants to become capable enough 

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.519
to be able to hold, and 

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:57.679
be some kind of a repository for the future, 

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:02.919
that one has to go through all this. One who wants to just realize,

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:06.120
it's not necessary 

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.240
none of these things are necessary, it's very simple, 

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.399
just a knock on your head, it should happen.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:19.320
When one becomes focused on Vishuddhi, 

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.519
they will develop a…blue colored aura, an electric blue aura. 

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:28.840
This is why all the very active,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.360
capable beings of the past,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.639
have always been blue bodied in India. 

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.639
So all of them are blue bodied, not because their skin was blue. 

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:45.960
Those who had the necessary awareness, when they looked that them, 

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.879
they saw 

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:49.080
they had a blue aura.  

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.120
In India, there are  so much literature about the blue bodied ones,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.840
because blue body meant 

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.039
an activity, or a dynamism 

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:10.039
with sweetness of emotion, and discernment of the mind. 

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:13.200
Because if too much sweetness of emotion happens, 

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.039
you don't want to involve in the world, you're just fine 

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:17.879
the way you are, 

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.759
you're just.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.200
If discernment of mind, intellect comes 

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.240
to such a point that you see everything distinctly clear, 

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.080
then you don't want to involve, because 

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.639
there is nothing to involve, what is there to involve? 

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:40.080
What is there to involve with livers and kidneys 

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.879
and intestines, and shit? 

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.679
What is there to involve in all this? So you become aloof. 

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:55.759
You have nothing to do with anybody. 

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:58.600
Only if you are active… 

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.279
See, these are two things, this is anahata, this is agna, 

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:06.320
between is this. Only if your vishuddhi is active, 

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.679
you're blue bodied, then you can be in sweetness of emotion, 

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:12.519
you have the discernment of mind, 

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:15.399
you can play the world whichever way you want, 

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:18.559
and still not be touched by it, 

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:21.879
then you are in a different kind of love affair, 

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:25.120
not with anything, not with anybody. 

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.720
The word love doesn't anymore indicate 

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.759
somebody or something to you.

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:34.559
It just means that 

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:38.000
your emotion is totally yours, 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.240
you can make it whichever way you want..
