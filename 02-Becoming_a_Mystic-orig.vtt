00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000


00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.960
You said little earlier that

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.160
to be enlightened and

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.480
to maintain the body

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.800
one would have to understand

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.840
all the mechanics of the body.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.840
Is that a possibility for us

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.760
to be aware and understand all those possibilities?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.720
though all those mechanics?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.040
It definitely is a possibility.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.720
Not that it is not possible.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.440
It is just…

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.080
we are still going through hoops

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.040
with fundamental aspects of life,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.400
with basic aspects of life.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.280
Then you can't pay the kind of attention that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.960
these things need.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.520
If you,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.680
if you have to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.160
know the intricacies of life,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.400
how life is made, if you want to know 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.520
rather let me use the word creation,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.600
it won't yield

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.200
unless you pay it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.120
the necessary attention,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.000
absolute attention.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.480
This is the reason why people think

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.040
it is long and arduous journey,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.320
need not be.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.960
It is very long and arduous because…

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.560
see suppose…

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.640
you drove from Detroit?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.760
Was it very long and arduous?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.640
Hum?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.520
No, you are sitting in a 21st century car,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.760
what the hell?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.960
In ten hours time you are here.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.000
It is neither long nor arduous, ok? (Laughs)

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.400
Suppose

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.400
your car is made like this,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.840
that its engine

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.920
works intermittently,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.520
every minute it's on,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.920
every minute it's off.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.880
Would it be very long and arduous?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.920
Hum?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.400
That's all.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.360
That's all it is.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.720
Your attention is on and off,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960
on and off, on and off,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.800
so it's very long and arduous.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.800
If your attention was just on,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.960
it's just a short journey.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.520
It is not even a journey actually.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.080
Opening your eyes to life

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.560
is not really a journey.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.520
But to understand the mechanics of

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.000
how creation is,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.040
yes, a certain amount of focus and….

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.240
One thing is realization,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.800
a little bit of learning also,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280
not a little bit, quite a bit of learning also

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.240
is involved in it.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.560
But without the necessary realization,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.280
learning won't mean anything.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.760
So we are waiting for the realization.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.840
If not the ultimate realization

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.280
at least some level of realization that

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.680
you are not going through hoops

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.960
for simple, basic aspects of life.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.640
If you stop going through hoops

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.720
for tiny things in life,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.720
then

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.160
it would be…

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.600
maybe time

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.280
to look at

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.960
how to learn a few things.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.440
I have

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.080
made attempts to set a few people

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.200
on that.
I thought all this should not be lost.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.760
Right now, I am sort of resigned to that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.840
anyway this will be lost with me.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.440
If people realize that's enough,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160
we will set up procedures and methods and

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.800
energy investments

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.680
to help people towards that realization.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.600
But all this knowing,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.200
I…,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.440
there was a time when I

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.240
worked hard with people

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.160
to get them there but

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.600
what I see is,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.520
even back in India it's so difficult to get people

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.040
to work hard toward these things

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.360
because this needs hard work,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.400
lot of hard work.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.200
If you're

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.400
really longing to know, it's not hard;

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.280
everything is fine with you.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.360
When there is no such longing,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.200
it feels like torture.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.600
And initially

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.560
you go into it willingly, after you,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.280
after some time you think I'm torturing you.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.520
This has happened again and again.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.680
So

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.600
I have not given up given up,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.800
but generally I'm ok if,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.560
if nobody gets there

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.640
in terms of knowing.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.120
It's ok

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.520
as long as people

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.760
are on the path of realization.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.480
If they are not really striving to know
the mechanics of creation,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.240
it's alright.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.760
I have….

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.680
I mean I'm not given up, given up

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.560
but I am ok

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.600
because

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.360
I have to work really hard
with them first of all.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.640
Unless people are willing to work hard enough,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.200
trying to work hard with them
just becomes ridiculous,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.520
you know.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.400
Once I am on,
I don't know how to stop.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.000
That's my problem.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.240
If I sit here and if,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.160
if I see

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.720
little fire in somebody's eyes

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.640
I forget that you need to go to the bathroom,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.040
you need to eat because

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.760
I forget that I need to go to the bathroom or eat.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.320
So I forget about your bladder also.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.320
When I have forgotten about mine,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.360
what's the problem with yours? (All Laugh)

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.640
So

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.640
once I am on to something, I'm,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.320
I'm on

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.760
but I don't see people are like that.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.320
People are on and off,
on and off, on and off.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.600
So

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.880
it becomes difficult to work.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.480
So we are just working towards realization.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.320
If people attain

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.200
towards that liberation,
that's good enough.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.320
A few people we are still working;

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.960
I am not saying there aren't anybody working.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.000
There're some people working on those things

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.160
but

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.240
the rate at which they are going,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.560
they will need lot of time.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.560
I don't think we have that much time on hands.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.280
They will need lots of time

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.800
at the pace at which they are going. 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.880
You can see,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.520
if somebody is reading

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.160
you know,
studying and learning at a certain pace, 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.240
you can say ok in 8 years time

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.400
he can become a doctor.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.760
If he is reading at a certain pace,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.840
you can say ok,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.360
in 50 years time he can become a doctor.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.920
Yes?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.800
Or if he is reading at a certain pace,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.640
you can say ok,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.320
in a few lifetimes he will become a doctor.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.560
This is just like that,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.280
after all it's physiology

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.800
on a deeper scale,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.840
that's all.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.600
So if you are willing to learn at a certain pace

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.160
then we know how long it's going to take.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.440
'No, no, no, I'm doing.'
Its fine you are doing but

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.040
I don't want to… I just have a life term.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.000
I don't have a 300 year sentence.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.720
I just have a life sentence here. (Laughs)

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.160
I am not a Agasthiya or something. (All Laugh)

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.560
How do we speed up the process,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.720
because the compulsions of the body and mind

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.480
keep getting in the way.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.280
How do we take care of the body & mind

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.120
so they don’t become hurdles?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.320
How to take care of your body?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.720
Don't make it important.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.120
Or start with your mind.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.680
What you think is not important.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.720
What you feel is not important.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.040
Make that happen,
let me see.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.680
Tomorrow is Easter;

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.280
Good Friday.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.480
It's a good day to crucify you.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.680
Hum?

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.640
Yes?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.120
Crucifixion means they fix somebody's body,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.120
right?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.400
So it's a good day to fix your body.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.040
You don't make it important;

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.640
it just hangs there

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.280
on the cross, its ok,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.800
let it just hang there.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Keep your mind...
First crucify your mind.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Let it just hang there.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.880
Whatever it says,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.920
if you have or recognize somebody as an utter idiot,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.240
what do you do?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.440
What do you do?

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.520
Suppose he happens to be your brother, or your sister,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.480
or your father, or your husband, ok...

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.480
(All Laugh)

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.880
I'm trying to make,
relate to things properly.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.680
(All Laugh)

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.880
What do you do?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.680
See, you just let him be around.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.040
Whatever he says you don't

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.040
stop him from speaking,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.080
but anyway you don't take it seriously.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.880
Yes?

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.840
That's what you do with your mind.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.120
Let him say whatever he says,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.440
you know he is a idiot.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440
So,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.680
but he is a, you know,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.280
you have a relationship with him.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.200
You have a relationship with him

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.040
So,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.320
you let him say whatever he wants to say,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.760
not paying any attention to him.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.600
Just the way he,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.440
you know... (Laughs)

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.640
So you do that to your mind,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.200
that's crucifixion for your mind.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.240
He just hangs there;

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.840
you don't pay any attention to it.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.880
Do that to your body later.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.960
First do it to your mind.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.320
Body is a easier business

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.840
compared to mind.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.680
First do that to your mind.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.040
What you think and
what you feel is not important,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.720
just do that to yourself, let me see.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.440
Because

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.880
what you think and feel is just a
psychological reality. 

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.440
Only because you are too caught up

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.400
in the psychological reality,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.400
you're missing the whole reality.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.640
All the time

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.080
you're living within the psychological reality

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.120
of who you are,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.160
not in the existential, isn't it?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.160
So when will you look beyond the psychological?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.040
If you think it's important,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.520
you'll never look beyond that,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520
isn't it?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.080
Because naturally your attention flows in the direction

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.200
of whatever you hold as important,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.520
isn't it so?

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.920
Yes?

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.560
Whatever you hold as important your attention

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.760
naturally flows in that direction.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.600
Right now
your thought and your emotion is important,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.800
so naturally your whole attention is right there.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.360
But that is a psychological reality;

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.560
that has nothing to do with the existential.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.360
So if you want to

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.200
move into the existential reality...

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.200
to put it very simply,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.480
you just have to see that I am a fool.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.960
Whatever

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.400
my mind says,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.720
whatever my emotion says,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.800
it has nothing to do with reality.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.200
It has no

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.680
greater relevance to life. 

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.800
It's just chattering away with nonsense

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.520
that you have gathered from somewhere else,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.840
isn't it?

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.680
If you understand this,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.400
don't pay any attention to it

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.440
and don't expect anybody else to pay attention to it.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.400
Yes.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.280
See

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.080
the best way to insult you right now you know,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.080
is

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.440
you are talking to me. 

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.320
I look at the sky.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.760
You are saying something important;

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.960
you are articulating your thought

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.840
but I don't pay any attention.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.440
This is the worst insult, isn't it?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.800
Why?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.000
Because your thought and emotion is so important,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
isn't it?

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.600
It is so...

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.800
I am looking at something so big, the sky,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.320
but that is not how it is.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.760
Your thought and emotion is bigger than the sky.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.920
Isn't it so?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.440
Right now it is. Isn't it so?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.840
The way you think and the way you feel is far bigger

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.080
than the sky

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.000
or the existence itself.
Isn't it so?

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.040
That is a

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.560
very distorted perception of life;

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.720
it has to change.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.760
Do it today, let's see.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.400
What you think,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.200
what you feel,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.720
your thought and your emotion is of no consequence.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.920
Make it like that for yourself.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.760
You will see suddenly life will start

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.600
bursting around you.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.240
This is all we did

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.280
in that...

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.160
what's that? By b b b b....

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840
Hum? 

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560
What?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.280
BSP.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.320
This is what we did.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.280
Whatever you think,

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.640
whatever you feel, your stories,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.760
your nonsense are not important.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.400
Not at all important.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.760
That's all that was done to you and

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.160
suddenly life started bursting within you,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.360
isn't it?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.200
Do that, this is a good Thursday. (All Laugh)
