00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.940
but especially the influence of the Earth,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.580
It's very directly connected to the nature of the Earth,

Of course, at least nobody could miss

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.873
the cycles of the moon and the feminine body. How they

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:47.430
connected,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.290
which is

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.500
very directly

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.450
So the rhythms and the cycles

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.160
particularly the Earth and the moon go through,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.990
and the moods that the sun goes through.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.280
In the ancient scriptures in
India,

cc186ec0-f09c-4774-9b1e-45dea2e876b9-0
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.730
they always talked about the moods of the sun.

94c0efe7-a39f-4d0e-8117-81329a01c585-0
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.410
Sun is not supposed to be Moody is all the time,

2da5cd21-cb66-43de-96bb-9610534b4b3c-0
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.880
Moon

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.500
every day. A new mood

e13f96ca-9c5c-4baa-9bc9-48f3312b75fa-0
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.360
with son is not supposed to have moods,

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.210
so this has been laughed at and made fun of.

8adb18eb-1740-422d-9701-82ee8498ed68-0
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.650
But today,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.460
very clearly,

15ae61f5-cd8e-42d7-8bf5-b210869ea507-0
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.300
scientists are telling us

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.570
that

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.420
the mood of the sun changes.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.920
They are still not able to

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.510
find a cycle

941804c6-2d06-430f-9200-3300cbd6d51d-0
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.760

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.280
The modern

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.550
solar science, if you can call that

cd116070-c405-4d7f-9a3b-77365ab422de-0
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.743
there is such a thing, I don't think so. They are only

cd116070-c405-4d7f-9a3b-77365ab422de-1
00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:28.820
interested in solar energy.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.070
For the ancient

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.410
text, talk about the moods of the sun

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.418
and the moods of the sun. Go through cycles of 12 year

2e7f07c3-1791-42bf-b4f7-1cf355f67c60-1
00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:45.230
periods.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.890
If you

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.850
if you get very,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.580
start Romancing the moon.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.917
Your mood changes every day.
Every 28 days you go through a

0eafa9a8-e747-4b7b-bea1-e9327a0cd9a0-1
00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:03.360
cycle.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.540
If you

a8b7bec3-6cb0-4e19-8e65-99021657a092-0
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.860
go by the moods of planet Earth,

c5856013-c8ad-4f46-b9bd-67a563fd4f5b-0
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.250
the surface moods for her changes every moment.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.650
Because I have just the

f3ff1cc3-9542-4f71-a033-abbae93c1672-0
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.190
where she is exposed

fcb7bbbc-e27e-44e5-8071-4f732d8fbe9f-0
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.520
her relationship with the sun

c612259e-0a43-4c11-ac5e-b745ab0eeeb6-0
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.864
and at what angle of exposure she has at that moment.

c612259e-0a43-4c11-ac5e-b745ab0eeeb6-1
00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:37.080
Accordingly, her moods change

a20f9568-eb5a-40e3-9822-98113cef475b-0
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.930
and the deeper moods

fa977370-7564-4f32-a622-bc9e855037f5-0
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.260
change according to the seasons and

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.930
12 month cycles.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.483
So did they just arrive at this?
This is 12 months, so that is 12

5d29d000-383c-441d-a84b-3a5ddfbbe9e8-1
00:05:53.483 --> 00:05:53.840

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.140
No. These patterns have been noticed

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.050

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.460
every 12 years

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.940
the type of

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.690
solar storms that happen,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.170
No

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.001
there are weather changes, weather patterns changing on the

edf4e0b8-6efe-450a-8f02-5b48424571cc-1
00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:19.880
sun surface

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.814
and by noticing these patterns they are saying every 12 years

17efa100-9013-4ca7-8706-198daa852ddd-1
00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:26.400
sun goes through cycle.

2b4e12bf-4376-41d3-9aa9-b1f30c986d5b-0
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.575
Why sun going through cycle?
These 2 are going through cycles

2b4e12bf-4376-41d3-9aa9-b1f30c986d5b-1
00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:35.430
because they are spinning and rotating around something.

efe8ea50-71cb-4bc1-9791-f8be7b067522-0
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.380
Why is sun going through a cycle?

4daee4da-c573-4307-9a10-681b172bef5d-0
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.034
His cycles are not of rotation.
His cycles are a fluctuation,

4daee4da-c573-4307-9a10-681b172bef5d-1
00:06:47.034 --> 00:06:48.490
like breathing.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.080
He breathes in and breathe out and breathe in and breathe out.

14e8b30a-6eba-4e9d-87b7-55a803c6237d-0
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.781
This is something that has been distinctly noticed in recent

14e8b30a-6eba-4e9d-87b7-55a803c6237d-1
00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:01.130
times,

475a8c14-49a4-4ef1-a185-0e43e6cfed50-0
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.130
that

2fe79a65-bf4f-4d33-80f8-432142fa9ecd-0
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.703
the sun surface is violently active at certain periods of

2fe79a65-bf4f-4d33-80f8-432142fa9ecd-1
00:07:08.703 --> 00:07:11.900
time and certain other periods it settles down.

cddd6e04-e02f-4bd2-ad60-8ab0f57338d8-0
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.730
So in the yogic

61169610-bc18-485a-afe1-d6a6326307ee-0
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.090
tradition,

60fcc726-b177-4ca6-86d1-9ec133f9e584-0
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.220
if someone has

b1f85f82-6453-4629-a120-1207c169c79d-0
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.800
a very steady breathing pattern

865060ab-0b18-4deb-a758-28f2c3147873-0
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.608
which is not subject to emotions, which is not subject

865060ab-0b18-4deb-a758-28f2c3147873-1
00:07:31.608 --> 00:07:34.640
to other aspects. When I say other aspects,

d5cb017c-461d-477a-ba51-6945c13485ff-0
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.480
if you observe yourself

9cf517a5-6fe9-4066-922d-ec43b1be0e8b-0
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.667
how your breath is on a full moon day, how your breath is on

9cf517a5-6fe9-4066-922d-ec43b1be0e8b-1
00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:49.514
your moon day, how it is on all the other days, if you watch

9cf517a5-6fe9-4066-922d-ec43b1be0e8b-2
00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:51.470
very carefully, it's different.

353f8ad6-37cb-4e57-8638-de5e7522c961-0
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.059
You don't realise if the impact of it. People around you will

353f8ad6-37cb-4e57-8638-de5e7522c961-1
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:56.300
know.

1347c858-9f4e-472a-ba33-0dfd758efddb-0
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.440
People who suffer your moods will know. You will not know

886af824-4c81-41f2-8e20-d809ebf37913-0
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.710
so the breath patterns keep changing.

7fee3bda-9c10-4f1a-8242-18e76f5c7c8a-0
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.651
So if someone has a breath pattern which does not change

7fee3bda-9c10-4f1a-8242-18e76f5c7c8a-1
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:17.560
with his emotion and thought,

9cee58ab-f721-4a07-b473-7d1e5252bcc4-0
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.590
they say he has a Surya
Shrivastava.

2c7a3469-581f-437b-b42c-a23cd6b8acb1-0
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.780
That means his breath is not subject to the moods.

6b246454-9394-4f71-8d50-ecd5bb1add54-0
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.314
It is subject to certain patterns, but not because of

6b246454-9394-4f71-8d50-ecd5bb1add54-1
00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:35.560
emotion and thought.

4e2b127f-4e59-40b0-beaa-5e71792d52f0-0
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.240
The idea of

96b631ce-148b-47e8-9f07-93545b0a00db-0
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.740
one aspect of doing the type of sadhana that we are doing is

698c8914-a673-4be8-a0cc-08a1c18f7b6b-0
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.450
if you want someone to become very

6f130d9e-9042-440f-9363-a2e0aa8d80c0-0
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.770
stable,

0e2830a8-7b6f-4a57-b566-505404e91344-0
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.100
then we work towards Surya
Ashvasan.

8a3d2cac-535c-40fc-b53a-aebffc6cbd33-0
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.240
If we want someone to become rhythmic,

22579379-4a86-4c53-bc8e-ac061cff5943-0
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.340
then we go for Chandrahasan.
