00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.710
You need to understand this the breath.

596417ea-3f67-4f4f-9c05-ceb6f4f33428-0
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.010
This idea that breath is about taking in oxygen. This must go.

f4d47b97-7c48-42a3-a264-4b99636fff95-0
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.630
That is only a secondary purpose of the breath

2a1d01b5-758e-4104-9afd-b151a84a41cf-0
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.178
for you to understand right now instead of seeing that I am

2a1d01b5-758e-4104-9afd-b151a84a41cf-1
00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:37.540
going to get some O2.

dbf2abdf-05f3-4667-9578-2a53436155ef-0
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.770
Whenever. You never seen the O,

2e8fe8e7-9398-4ecb-a23d-20ba3ce32dcd-0
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.480
have you?

2568fed4-00d6-4abb-92a5-b2f83da9bd91-0
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.427
You never seen the O. So instead of thinking like that, I want

2568fed4-00d6-4abb-92a5-b2f83da9bd91-1
00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:48.200
you to think

83cc988a-2cc2-44fb-a393-ca72c4892196-0
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.060
in terms of

aefcd80b-4690-4dbd-8e5f-3277bb575c4f-0
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.880
your life is happening only because of this.

525e708a-17db-4761-89b4-8a6c6ee7fc0a-0
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.750
The atmosphere outside

ea0ea684-95a4-4e5e-825d-fe4cb313b756-0
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.330
is your external lung

13b8c781-5eef-46e7-8574-1a9e0a0f5acb-0
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.822
only because it pumps in and pumps out, not because this

13b8c781-5eef-46e7-8574-1a9e0a0f5acb-1
00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:09.633
pumps in, because that's pumping and pumping out. This is

13b8c781-5eef-46e7-8574-1a9e0a0f5acb-2
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:10.070
happening

329a8492-37ee-4f96-a278-452b967dda7f-0
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.390
now.

f92dbd1a-684d-48b0-9bf6-d9340c755ca3-0
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.670
The whole planet and its energies are doing that.

4c72e12c-3062-4804-8dd2-7ee889563cbb-0
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.605
The planet is not taking in oxygen from the outer space, but

4c72e12c-3062-4804-8dd2-7ee889563cbb-1
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.110
still this is happening.

6c5821d3-97e8-477c-b22d-c60717e20d3b-0
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.670
So its not about you taking in an oxygen and letting it out.

3f2d031f-75f1-4c95-b956-126350c54da3-0
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.327
It is a common thing for people who are in any kind of yogic

3f2d031f-75f1-4c95-b956-126350c54da3-1
00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:46.394
practice. Even if you are just doing asanas, it is very common

3f2d031f-75f1-4c95-b956-126350c54da3-2
00:01:46.394 --> 00:01:49.944
that when you come to relaxation, it is not only about

3f2d031f-75f1-4c95-b956-126350c54da3-3
00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:53.495
yogic practice, but anybody who is capable of bringing

3f2d031f-75f1-4c95-b956-126350c54da3-4
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:56.400
themselves to a certain state of relaxation.

34c1f237-fe38-49af-a00b-96f27418f492-0
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.933
They will always notice there are moments in their life when

34c1f237-fe38-49af-a00b-96f27418f492-1
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.210
they don't need to breathe.

a1a46366-0578-492e-b141-104dbf9198d0-0
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.490
It is just that How long can you make that moment that may be

a1a46366-0578-492e-b141-104dbf9198d0-1
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.039
different from person to person because your relaxation,

a1a46366-0578-492e-b141-104dbf9198d0-2
00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.970
relaxation itself is momentary.

97449e15-8610-4c8c-bc73-65e2e54fcb72-0
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.570
Have you ever remained like a certain moment? You are lying

97449e15-8610-4c8c-bc73-65e2e54fcb72-1
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.870
down.

359aa45e-793c-434e-9f12-bea0538b6dd5-0
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.770
You don't remain there the next moment

221d9230-773a-44df-843d-3fb13ba7ceb2-0
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.940
something its active. Have you noticed in Shunya meditation

91d871b6-0e2d-43c7-8c19-0ab459037193-0
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.430
when you simply become like this breath is almost not there.

d870e879-4bc3-439f-94fa-643c6d03a5c4-0
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.820
Ohh, I am not breathing.

e243582d-eb9c-47a8-a31e-904ef2587a56-0
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.500
Starts breathing.

98568310-4db8-4883-9d04-71195f32264b-0
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.915
So when you say I am not breathing, your body is not

98568310-4db8-4883-9d04-71195f32264b-1
00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:58.810
taking instructions from you on breathing.

d61989dd-8f49-46ce-a1fc-1dc55e5a4dd7-0
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.231
It is just that the relaxation is gone now because mentally you

d61989dd-8f49-46ce-a1fc-1dc55e5a4dd7-1
00:03:04.231 --> 00:03:07.510
beginning to become active once activity comes.

93e6d521-8dff-4d2e-8714-9a5925f212f1-0
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.472
Its very normal even if you are in physical activity. If you are

93e6d521-8dff-4d2e-8714-9a5925f212f1-1
00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:15.550
extremely relaxed,

89c8f603-a687-41c1-bbc7-f0ea897431ce-0
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.412
many times the breath is like that. You almost have to move

89c8f603-a687-41c1-bbc7-f0ea897431ce-1
00:03:20.412 --> 00:03:23.710
it. Otherwise its just like that. It doesn't go by itself.

efca3bb6-b2fb-41f8-9f94-05147d0d11d2-0
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.890
You will see.

0752c314-93bd-4582-bdde-75da62aac242-0
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.010
Ah,

e2c79168-6d97-4c7f-9e1a-b89bc8f926a4-0
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.340
I don't know if you see people like that, but I see people

1390e5d7-5405-4fd3-a7ca-41f5733a3005-0
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.030
see these athletes and people who

6a58cce2-72b1-42fc-8e31-776dca226140-0
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.610
who are doing some physical activity for high stakes.

e132252f-5709-48cd-ac74-9821a3d3270e-0
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.720
They are trying to bring that moment where their breath is.

77454998-ce6b-40b8-8ba2-58e21a10d8b0-0
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.050
They are trying to

3abf2fc2-e889-48a5-bb47-07020790f62d-0
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.979
knowingly. He wants to do Ujjayi and come to a certain level of

3abf2fc2-e889-48a5-bb47-07020790f62d-1
00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.339
relaxation where it sits like this. There is one moment of he

3abf2fc2-e889-48a5-bb47-07020790f62d-2
00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.800
wants to start off at that moment.

518dee3c-88f4-4996-b8b0-c46246361266-0
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.340
Have you noticed this? What do you think they are trying to do?

37121c73-7731-4ff4-94c1-9928d16eed59-0
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.158
What is it so if you want to wait, fame, metabolic activity

37121c73-7731-4ff4-94c1-9928d16eed59-1
00:04:28.158 --> 00:04:32.100
has to be high for you to jump into action. You must do.

f15549ce-e747-49a5-922e-78ddc802b5b4-0
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.620
No. They are trying to bring it down, isn't it?

0bb943d8-1434-43a2-a6b8-8aa5141c1c24-0
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.233
Because somewhere, anybody who is in a high state of

0bb943d8-1434-43a2-a6b8-8aa5141c1c24-1
00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:44.680
performance is under the understanding that that moment

0bb943d8-1434-43a2-a6b8-8aa5141c1c24-2
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.390
of relaxation is the basis of all activity.

51325bc8-6dad-4221-89bc-370361e7d348-0
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.733
If activity has to be very penetrative, if your action has

51325bc8-6dad-4221-89bc-370361e7d348-1
00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:56.751
to have a certain level of penetration, you must have a

51325bc8-6dad-4221-89bc-370361e7d348-2
00:04:56.751 --> 00:05:00.913
certain level of relaxation.
Otherwise, it's not going to

51325bc8-6dad-4221-89bc-370361e7d348-3
00:05:00.913 --> 00:05:02.420
happen. You must see,

b4c92d39-e746-4153-bdf8-53e0217526ff-0
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.290
you know there is a few meditators in India who are

d7410df7-cd88-43a4-b23b-7bcdb7151d39-0
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.990
sharp shooters, who are shooting people, whose for sport,

b8a2bbcd-e704-4ea3-aee3-7470bc0eba5c-0
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.698
they have one of your medals and one of them almost entered

b8a2bbcd-e704-4ea3-aee3-7470bc0eba5c-1
00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:20.460
Olympics and all that. So you should see the way they do

40028462-918e-4de4-8218-e1e06adae88f-0
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.200
constantly.

46a105dd-406b-4c62-97c4-cbc5b01ddf11-0
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.100
I asked them, Who trained you like this?

bae2d51d-cbd9-42f0-af27-edb6490f7dc3-0
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.930


99dc9e85-1ef0-434a-850a-6aff8674a69b-0
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.006
Nobody trained them like that.
It's just that it's natural.

99dc9e85-1ef0-434a-850a-6aff8674a69b-1
00:05:38.006 --> 00:05:41.867
When they want to bring them, they themselves to that level of

99dc9e85-1ef0-434a-850a-6aff8674a69b-2
00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:45.727
relaxation where everything is chill naturally. They using the

99dc9e85-1ef0-434a-850a-6aff8674a69b-3
00:05:45.727 --> 00:05:49.220
breath. So breath is not just about taking in oxygen and

99dc9e85-1ef0-434a-850a-6aff8674a69b-4
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.081
living out carbon dioxide. That is something that is happening

99dc9e85-1ef0-434a-850a-6aff8674a69b-5
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:53.510
anyway.

66194547-1252-4499-a588-f5ea44c0294f-0
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.177
That is, that is one of the functions. Breath is acting as a

66194547-1252-4499-a588-f5ea44c0294f-1
00:05:58.177 --> 00:05:58.670
carrier,

3c1247c2-3e1a-41ef-958e-cba692e41d6b-0
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.207
but there is something called as breath which is beyond the air

3c1247c2-3e1a-41ef-958e-cba692e41d6b-1
00:06:03.207 --> 00:06:04.200
that you breathe,

03fb17b4-b7aa-41aa-a673-b5b74efd9dc8-0
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.080
which is what yoga is referring to a school Munadi.

a0f9ddb5-485b-401e-9d28-761dd549897e-0
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.698
So when we do any kind of conscious breathing processes

a0f9ddb5-485b-401e-9d28-761dd549897e-1
00:06:14.698 --> 00:06:20.070
like Kriya's and Paniyon, we are trying to activate the tornado.

8c73c719-c205-48e0-9d1a-0c895c211c88-0
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.879
Our interest is not taking in more oxygen as all kinds of non

8c73c719-c205-48e0-9d1a-0c895c211c88-1
00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.110
practicing yogis are writing books about.

1d267099-379d-4c87-b84a-04532c0a3110-0
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.001
Yes, taking in oxygen does its own things. But to take in

1d267099-379d-4c87-b84a-04532c0a3110-1
00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:35.920
oxygen you don't have to do yoga.

b95f7aec-74be-490e-83b2-fde6326da214-0
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.360
If you climb mountain, you will take a lot of oxygen.

63de64dc-f3fa-4963-a3d9-6bec3d1e68be-0
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.472
If you go play tennis, you will take lot of oxygen. You go play

63de64dc-f3fa-4963-a3d9-6bec3d1e68be-1
00:06:44.472 --> 00:06:46.880
soccer, you will take plenty of oxygen. OK,

0c316d0f-e3a9-43b8-a40f-cb42b69dc150-0
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.339
you don't have to sit and do yoga to take an oxygen. It's

0c316d0f-e3a9-43b8-a40f-cb42b69dc150-1
00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:53.780
quite a boring thing.

31603e11-037b-4406-a0dd-28e7a497216b-0
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.367
If you don't touch another dimension, it's quite a boring

31603e11-037b-4406-a0dd-28e7a497216b-1
00:06:58.367 --> 00:06:58.660
thing

052240be-ad30-4eb1-b67b-2b1d2393884c-0
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.200
playing a game. Isn't it much better?

9cdaf8e2-50b4-43fb-8004-4a235d9bc696-0
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.940
What

4e3796c1-4733-4337-9565-584b53288802-0
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.222
Erase. You can say yes it's alright, I am a Yogi. But you

4e3796c1-4733-4337-9565-584b53288802-1
00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:14.315
can say yes. It is a boring thing. Only if you use it as a

4e3796c1-4733-4337-9565-584b53288802-2
00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:18.060
means to touch another dimension. Then it's something

4e3796c1-4733-4337-9565-584b53288802-3
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.430
else to take in oxygen. Doing yoga is an utterly boring thing.

e0a2d44d-b104-4a3e-ba3c-e3698c835829-0
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.390
You can go play a game plan mountain swim,

80a6d224-ae1f-480d-bd80-5a0e8121d3a8-0
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.743
so your breath has to be conscious and its at a certain

80a6d224-ae1f-480d-bd80-5a0e8121d3a8-1
00:07:33.743 --> 00:07:34.280
place,

e82166c2-d957-49d2-96a2-89bef3d133f6-0
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.290
whatever the other aspects of it, the various other aspects to

e82166c2-d957-49d2-96a2-89bef3d133f6-1
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.336
it in terms of physiological benefits, psychological

e82166c2-d957-49d2-96a2-89bef3d133f6-2
00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:51.899
benefits, spiritual dimension to it. But one simple aspect is

062e70c7-4124-4610-8417-4bfb8dbcab64-0
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.946
if this dimension which is the link between the physical body

062e70c7-4124-4610-8417-4bfb8dbcab64-1
00:07:56.946 --> 00:08:00.666
and the non physical dimension which is a very source of

062e70c7-4124-4610-8417-4bfb8dbcab64-2
00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:04.060
creation. If this becomes a strong force by itself,

e3565408-3529-4889-a41d-c758e8f24297-0
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.960
you and that not the physical, the physicality of who you are,

fef8191e-b0be-474e-88f5-2492dd093b33-0
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.358
the psychological structure which you call as myself, and

fef8191e-b0be-474e-88f5-2492dd093b33-1
00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:17.505
that dimension which is a source of all this, will naturally be

fef8191e-b0be-474e-88f5-2492dd093b33-2
00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:21.782
connected all the time. The idea is that Divine is not an idea in

fef8191e-b0be-474e-88f5-2492dd093b33-3
00:08:21.782 --> 00:08:25.670
your life. Divine is not a belief in your life. Divine is a

fef8191e-b0be-474e-88f5-2492dd093b33-4
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.550
living presence in your life.

dc3e796b-f43e-4e51-a335-195244acd4df-0
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.991
So we have to strengthen the subtle body, Not taking in more

dc3e796b-f43e-4e51-a335-195244acd4df-1
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:34.480
oxygen,

854eb2eb-35af-4aaf-9c6b-5f4086637c54-0
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.160
are not letting your breath go out its own thing.

27581b23-a330-4638-ac71-7290a1a4d82e-0
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.075
For many of you if you meditate, if you do certain things, there

27581b23-a330-4638-ac71-7290a1a4d82e-1
00:08:43.075 --> 00:08:46.366
may be a tendency for the breath to go away to its own level I

27581b23-a330-4638-ac71-7290a1a4d82e-2
00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:49.762
think which has been stabilised.
Now there many other people you

27581b23-a330-4638-ac71-7290a1a4d82e-3
00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.896
will see who will come and sit the 3 weeks sadhana. Another

27581b23-a330-4638-ac71-7290a1a4d82e-4
00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:55.769
people, if little something experience happens, breath

27581b23-a330-4638-ac71-7290a1a4d82e-5
00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:56.709
becomes like this.

0ae5d12e-ba6b-493f-8d87-fc389a4eb45a-0
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.007
Now that has been that is one basic thing that we have been

0ae5d12e-ba6b-493f-8d87-fc389a4eb45a-1
00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:04.811
trying to change in the last 3
months that if something touches

0ae5d12e-ba6b-493f-8d87-fc389a4eb45a-2
00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:07.190
you, you become still, you don't become

7072fe52-4027-4609-8c60-6f6775bf3e6c-0
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.090
this,

e7995b57-c573-4e98-9d98-ddb75abbae3a-0
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.570
Is it beginning to happen or not for sure its happening.

3ccb8b7e-b7be-4a4b-8ebf-b657100b8929-0
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.191
When I look you look at you beyond your physical structure,

3ccb8b7e-b7be-4a4b-8ebf-b657100b8929-1
00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:22.229
it is distinctly there, OK. So that is the basis of sadhana.

3ccb8b7e-b7be-4a4b-8ebf-b657100b8929-2
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:26.333
That is the basis of being here and doing the needed sadhana.

3ccb8b7e-b7be-4a4b-8ebf-b657100b8929-3
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:30.239
That is the basis of doing lifelong sadhana. So that these

3ccb8b7e-b7be-4a4b-8ebf-b657100b8929-4
00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:33.879
3 dimension are are well integrated and connected on a

3ccb8b7e-b7be-4a4b-8ebf-b657100b8929-5
00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:37.917
moment to moment basis. Its not like once. In a way there is

3ccb8b7e-b7be-4a4b-8ebf-b657100b8929-6
00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:39.440
some experience for us.

4c0ceeb7-a167-4005-a123-c569da6aa648-0
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.050
We are not looking for highs.

e0100d28-bf9c-40de-8b76-d5c50b427530-0
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.250
We are looking for a constant contact with the dimension.

03c067a2-3753-4232-a4c8-f3272dabd4f9-0
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.500
Only then it finds expression

75a8fbfc-c468-4077-8d0b-f1d66cbf2a72-0
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.985
in the way you live, in the way you exist, in the way you can do

75a8fbfc-c468-4077-8d0b-f1d66cbf2a72-1
00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:57.220
things, in everything its fines.
Expression not otherwise

181d2210-6227-4819-bba8-8cb582b38b77-0
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.350
divine is incapable of laying a road.

42fe2a70-8840-4cfc-8091-becb2e512e91-0
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.330
When we say

c96f1b2f-4351-403f-b1eb-6aca201c33e8-0
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.596
we are on a spiritual path, what we are doing is we are laying up

c96f1b2f-4351-403f-b1eb-6aca201c33e8-1
00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:19.800
pathway because divine has no hands and legs.

f3fa4bc7-c30b-42a8-aae6-f078ad1eae3c-0
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.280
Quite incapable he is, except for creation.

0d09e195-a9e7-4310-bb14-b4fd3d7284e5-0
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.690
Isn't this? Can you eat a banana?

f1919da3-7491-4e36-8cd2-98145350e675-0
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.030
You can produce one. Can eat one? No,

4f2c861c-f8a1-43d5-932e-5ba4b46e6109-0
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.630
you can create a banana but he cant eat one isn't it?

007aeb3c-1b9a-4777-93fd-26666803617b-0
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.170
So this is what I meant by saying

f5c81533-20b0-4a96-9e41-01894181d1e2-0
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.582
if you go on a certain dimension, now you are asking

f5c81533-20b0-4a96-9e41-01894181d1e2-1
00:10:47.582 --> 00:10:51.207
you want to move further. If you go on a certain dimension, now

f5c81533-20b0-4a96-9e41-01894181d1e2-2
00:10:51.207 --> 00:10:53.700
there is only transmission, No transaction.

ac32ef7c-1c74-431a-b4d4-0765c367b101-0
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.445
Divine can produce a banana, can produce an apple, can produce

ac32ef7c-1c74-431a-b4d4-0765c367b101-1
00:10:58.445 --> 00:10:59.280
everything but

68501384-81ec-4778-922a-b84c7fd1b94a-0
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.610
cannot eat.

1fee63fe-27a1-4390-b89c-22dee63e6599-0
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.178
So when we say Brahmacharya this is what we are saying. He is on

1fee63fe-27a1-4390-b89c-22dee63e6599-1
00:11:06.178 --> 00:11:09.632
the path of the divine. That means he only does this. He

1fee63fe-27a1-4390-b89c-22dee63e6599-2
00:11:09.632 --> 00:11:12.420
cannot do this. If he does that, he will pay.

9af39cc4-839b-4035-8094-7c7421463862-0
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.650
Understand what I'm saying?

171be581-f3ff-4b76-a4c9-a5f6d76009c9-0
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.662
That is why it's called
Brahmacharya, which literally

171be581-f3ff-4b76-a4c9-a5f6d76009c9-1
00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:23.636
means he is on the path of the divine. He can only transmit. He

171be581-f3ff-4b76-a4c9-a5f6d76009c9-2
00:11:23.636 --> 00:11:24.629
cannot transact.

83d39ba6-5b7e-400d-9917-6e85946febe9-0
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.970
There is no transaction with the divine only transmission isn't

5104cf0f-227a-4b43-b36c-2920027d0ce1-0
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.530
another way to exist

908c962b-2eec-442a-9449-091c1bf82a28-0
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.120
for which there is no

b9776f3e-e3de-4310-92b6-6357e7c2344e-0
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.790
explanation or substitute.

698ca3ad-3237-43f3-ae7c-e2e26e8b7cf2-0
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:52.000
