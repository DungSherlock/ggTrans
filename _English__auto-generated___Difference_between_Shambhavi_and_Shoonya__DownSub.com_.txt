when you do the sadhana
when you do shambhavi for example
shunya is not supposed to be fireworks i
hope they didn't say fireworks are going
to happen and shown you
emptiness is supposed to happen i'm sure
that's not going to be explosive
there was a time when shown your
initiations used to be explosive
but we've controlled that because we're
trying to fit into a civilized society
who don't freak who don't make any
joyful sounds no matter what
happens to them
civilization and unfortunately
particularly in the western part of the
world
civilization and seriousness have become
synonymous
if you're civilized you cannot be joyful
that's the kind of setup that people
have created
which is tragic
if you can't be joyful if only a caveman
can be joyful
i think it's worth remaining a caveman
look at me
you're civilized and you're dead serious
it's of no value because
what's the point
we worked upon civilizing human
societies
only to see that every human being can
find expression to who he is
without any interference from anybody
else
but now in the name of civilization
nobody finds expression to anything in
their life
and that's become the civilization
so when i do shambhavi
why am i not freaking
there are various aspects to this
to put it very simply is it my karma yes
so is it my bad karma no
it is your family's good karma
that you don't freak in the morning
it's your neighbor's good karma that you
don't freak in the morning
see karma is not all individual there is
also collective karma you must
understand this
so if there is no experience at all
i don't think you would have carried on
for two years
it is just that fireworks are not
happening
you know what's happening to somebody
else is not happening to you
that's all the question is
so as you've been told don't compare
yourself to anybody
do not expect anything just do it it's
okay i expected nothing i'm doing it and
doing it and still nothing is happening
if nothing happens that's the greatest
thing to happen
everybody's working towards that with
little something and something and
something so whether it's shambhavi
or whatever other practice that one does
the practice itself is not designed
towards an experience the practice
is only designed to bring a certain
amount of fluidity into your energies
it is structured so that gradually as
you practice you become more and more
fluid on all levels
instead of being rigid block of concrete
you are becoming little more fluid
maybe in one person this becomes love in
another person it becomes utter
blissfulness
in another person it becomes screams in
another person he becomes little gentler
than what he is
in another person he just becomes little
more sensible
so how it may find expression in each
person
is according to whatever is missing in
his life
the practice is not designed to create
an experience the practice is only
designed
to break the barriers so that a rigid
concrete block slowly becomes
more and more fluid
how each being finds expression depends
on
variety of factors to put it very simply
as you put it it is karmic structure
what kind of karma but do not ever
understand
karma as is it my bad karma nothing is
happening to me
that's not the point there is no such
thing as good karma and bad karma if you
ask me
because karma is like one way of looking
at karma is it's a certain bondage
it's the only bondage another way of
looking at karma
is it is your only savior
you're alive only because of your karma
if i take away all your karma you will
be done today
right now
so karma is both things it's your glue
when you want to stick to something glue
is a good thing
when you want to get away glue is not a
good thing
so for those who want to stick to
something
karma is a good thing it's their friend
for those who want to become liberated
for them karmic glue
seems like an enemy so it's just
contextual
it is not the nature of the karma it is
just the context in which you're looking
at
if you're seeing how to bind yourself
the karmic glue is good it's cementing
factor
if you're seeing how to liberate
yourself the karmic glue
looks like a binding factor because it
is smeared all over you
and whatever you touch it sticks to you
i want you to just visualize yourself
let's say you are smeared with super
glue
head to toe now i want you to walk
through your office your home and
whatever else
just see in 24 hours time you will be
heap of things
isn't it you will be one big heap of so
many things
some things that you want to stick to
many things that you don't want to stick
to
everything will be sticking to you
because you have super glue on you
so karma is that kind of super glue now
when you walk through the world
everything sticks to you what you want
sticks to you what you don't want sticks
to you
what you don't want becomes a large
volume of things which are sticking to
you then you start looking for
liberation
when whatever you think you want is
sticking to you
then at that time the thoughts of
liberation does not arise in most
people's minds
it takes enormous intelligence for a
human being
to seek liberation when everything in
his life is pleasant
when everything in his life is good to
still seek liberation
it takes a certain amount of
intelligence
when things have gone bad i think any
fool will seek liberation
there's no question about it
so right now shambhavi or shunya is a
tool for your liberation
slowly weakening the strength of the
super
glue so that it becomes a weak glue
if you want you can pick up and stick it
to yourself
if you don't want you can pull it and
throw it in the bin
it gives you that much freedom gradually
whether you freaked or you did not
freaked in the morning
doesn't mean anything
so if you like to walk through the world
freaking you can do that
if you walk if you want to work to the
world sober
you can do that but the important thing
is
is your super glue becoming diluted
enough
so that you have a choice to choose what
sticks to you when what doesn't stick to
you
has that much choice risen in your life
that is slowly definitely happening
whether you are able to gauge it or not
whether you're able to notice it or not
that is definitely happening
if you're doing your sadhana regularly
that is for sure
happening that your super glue
is no more super it is just an ordinary
glow
you can easily pull off things which are
sticking to you now
earlier when something stuck to you you
could never take it off
now you are able to take it off and only
choose what sticks to you
and for how long
this is the reason why the family feels
very threatened
nobody is threatening them nothing is
being
nobody is telling them nobody is telling
anybody anything about these things
but suddenly super glue has become just
an ordinary glue that if you choose you
can stick it
otherwise no just the choice threatens
people
just the freedom of choice threatens
people anybody
who is threatened by the freedom of
choice is a tyrant
you should not be stuck to that
you have a choice and still you choose
to stick that's beautiful
if you want to remove the freedom of
choice
then this is tirani
so this tirani is slowly being weakened
both from your end and from the
whichever other end it's coming to you
above all from your end because what's
happening from outside is not the
relevant thing
what's happening from within you that
your glue has become a light
glue that you can stick things to you by
choice
no more do you gather a heap of things
wherever you go
that for sure is happening and that's
the reason you're doing sadhana
not to disturb your neighborhood
foreign
you
