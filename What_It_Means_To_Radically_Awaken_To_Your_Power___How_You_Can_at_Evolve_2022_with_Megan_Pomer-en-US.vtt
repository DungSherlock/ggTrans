894365c3-afc1-4f18-9784-228f3a862d1c-0
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.160
This is my mentor, Doctor
Jafali.

30aeb380-7387-4db8-b1d6-56954bfdb0ca-0
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.880
How are you?

1748d3ad-c185-47e8-ab6b-17c54daad76b-0
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.880
Oh my God, this is my first live ever.

d4e3c783-3ec8-4eb1-b7de-2f332b8e8346-0
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.560
I've never done live before.

1743b9d8-7893-47b1-8da8-6029232b2e17-0
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.480
What is this?

446f20dd-57ba-429e-a9cb-8a78f24dec43-0
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.840
My first?

52215ca0-b338-40bd-b870-aecfefaf99a7-0
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.690
I've never done live in my whole life because I was so

52215ca0-b338-40bd-b870-aecfefaf99a7-1
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.592
subconscious that Oh my God, people will be watching on

52215ca0-b338-40bd-b870-aecfefaf99a7-2
00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:18.080
digital and what are they going to be thinking?

f63be0eb-71f0-4ed1-a548-8a8b2503047f-0
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.920
And then the first one is for you.

873f06ae-a586-4cc6-9706-76e20bafd338-0
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.095
I've been dragging this moment since last June because last

873f06ae-a586-4cc6-9706-76e20bafd338-1
00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:24.440
year.

41b49274-7094-4011-bc36-8e40c3f63e5e-0
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.652
OK guys, I'm going to go briefly into like How I Met Doctor

41b49274-7094-4011-bc36-8e40c3f63e5e-1
00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:31.080
Jafali and then we're going to dive into the real conversation.

2747e5a4-852b-4363-aa97-74af204d526a-0
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.913
Last June, on my birthday last year of my 20s, I felt like I

2747e5a4-852b-4363-aa97-74af204d526a-1
00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:40.201
failed life because I had achieved everything on my bucket

2747e5a4-852b-4363-aa97-74af204d526a-2
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.400
list, but I was so miserable on the inside.

4c6192ca-380e-41ca-9d0a-5b84d0d98dbc-0
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.640
It was like jumping from one relationship to another, going

4c6192ca-380e-41ca-9d0a-5b84d0d98dbc-1
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.200
to everyone.

978e9550-bf20-4aaa-870a-521dedfa4537-0
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.720
Do you love me?

6c68682e-eb85-4cf5-820c-975e942480a0-0
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.040
Do you love me to feel good about myself.

cb04b103-c586-4083-bc42-a382ab48bf6f-0
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.360
So then I watched a video.

e6dcaf19-e502-417c-a822-51d3ed3164ce-0
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.360
It was Doctor Shepali on Oprah called Super Soul Sunday.

df020fd8-caf9-4a72-a5b8-24bab946e97a-0
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.600
You got to watch it if you haven't.

1e9f94c9-9737-4963-9193-c64a0405c605-0
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.670
And she started to talk about how as women we find our worth

1e9f94c9-9737-4963-9193-c64a0405c605-1
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.840
and value by getting external validation from others.

a6c0bd8e-e7ea-41ef-8d7d-674e1ebc8ecf-0
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.440
And I was like that that that is exactly how I'm feeling.

5389b2ff-63a9-434c-a60d-64b5b88c13f8-0
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.614
And I reached out to her and I
was supposed to go on live with

5389b2ff-63a9-434c-a60d-64b5b88c13f8-1
00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.320
her last year.

d49f75f6-1a52-4e3c-9663-faabf2afaf47-0
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800
But I, the voice of I'm not worth it.

2563205d-8141-4d47-b171-3594234000d7-0
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm not good enough has been killing me and it's Doctor

2563205d-8141-4d47-b171-3594234000d7-1
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.800
Shepali, said.

10cc4e6b-2255-43fa-b8b4-aa64cee551a5-0
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.787
Megan, I want you to follow my lead for a year and I promise

10cc4e6b-2255-43fa-b8b4-aa64cee551a5-1
00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:26.120
you after a year you will be transformed.

ac93598a-7503-4e20-a4d6-e28e93d2c786-0
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.800
Guys, this is not the cliche stuff you read on books.

f8bcb9b9-62f4-49c3-9455-e7014b5768cc-0
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.080
I'm living proof.

21c1e681-6ff0-4a8a-8d20-f86dff057312-0
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.906
This is my mission because I was the girl that was reading those

21c1e681-6ff0-4a8a-8d20-f86dff057312-1
00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.733
books and listening to the experts saying you can be

21c1e681-6ff0-4a8a-8d20-f86dff057312-2
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:40.560
transformed, you can be happier, you can't feel joy.

4d4915a5-1752-4f3c-8054-f28d9c9b98d3-0
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.480
And I was like, nice books, nice writings.

a037ccb8-1e3f-4f44-917e-39061d1c2c50-0
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.920
It is true.

a4a001b1-4077-434b-8228-0d031d7bfad4-0
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.445
I am a different person after a year and the fact that I can

a4a001b1-4077-434b-8228-0d031d7bfad4-1
00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.320
even do this life.

dbc80fc2-9895-4f7d-b8f1-a56387033576-0
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.848
I know for you it might be very little, but for me this is a big

dbc80fc2-9895-4f7d-b8f1-a56387033576-1
00:01:53.848 --> 00:01:54.120
deal.

06fe7f9e-9348-4a51-a168-546dabde8b50-0
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.440
It took me a year to feel like
I'm worth it.

a0baec2f-e891-4a2c-973b-2d43c13f4295-0
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.280
To do a life with a woman That I
she's my Buddha.

288a3bf1-9a2e-4c43-8d60-79982368b2e0-0
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.920
I adore her.

d071060f-62af-4c0e-a94d-648877a53570-0
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.840
I she saved my life.

1071cc73-c0a4-4933-99ac-519618051d54-0
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.400
This is not complimenting anybody.

19033987-71e6-4bef-a1f6-e7567eec0683-0
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.320
This is real life.

e9d5d04e-ba26-4ec1-bf62-722b51543376-0
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.760
She changed my destiny.

16570f3e-2256-4a90-bd7f-3a37d32ad9b2-0
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.040
I will go into this later, but this is not about me.

49e35650-7425-4697-81b1-cc08b38d52af-0
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.089
This is about her work and how she can transform you, Doctor

49e35650-7425-4697-81b1-cc08b38d52af-1
00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.600
trolley.

53ca9221-1790-461c-9631-a7d3f3246d1f-0
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.200
Sorry, was such a long intro.

9eb0ed2f-3091-4c08-a9f0-8423e69ad008-0
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.080
But thank you.

eaddfb03-c19c-473b-bd5e-95facb09ecf1-0
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.360
Thank you.

31470296-f686-430f-a23b-3ef0d79615c9-0
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
We're here a year later.

a11e09f9-ba0a-4f18-85ad-6d4f1436fed5-0
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.400
No.

c82aed53-675a-4ca5-84fd-275ca42991ba-0
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.640
So.

2757e26d-e0d0-4b0b-8359-7a6419a629e1-0
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.185
So Megan, you know you and this is what I tell everyone, they

2757e26d-e0d0-4b0b-8359-7a6419a629e1-1
00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:29.200
people want to change, right?

e5119870-64c8-4752-8b8f-34d603fdcc6b-0
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.936
And I say and they want me to like fix them right away and

e5119870-64c8-4752-8b8f-34d603fdcc6b-1
00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:34.520
give them the strategies.

e100b08b-8523-4774-af63-9f1a1ece9160-0
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.360
And I say it takes six months to a year and it takes time.

c3eaae47-c0b9-4314-8656-fccc0886d159-0
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.220
But you had all the ingredients that it took, and that's why I

c3eaae47-c0b9-4314-8656-fccc0886d159-1
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.840
was committed to you.

96c2a9e2-d1a9-4834-9353-5220c17be2d3-0
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.440
And what are the ingredients?

8bb17e58-bf5a-4a1b-a800-0c6df1155983-0
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.192
And if people don't have these ingredients, they will not come

8bb17e58-bf5a-4a1b-a800-0c6df1155983-1
00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:52.800
to the threshold of change.

3ce4fca8-9b7a-4030-a4ed-3839669a6c3c-0
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.680
So what are the ingredients?

ead64182-9db5-4db2-9eea-458438a77190-0
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.520
The ingredients are a lot of pain, right?

7f6f772e-2fd9-415b-bdf4-8ec835d98174-0
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.540
That's the first thing you have to have enough pain that you are

7f6f772e-2fd9-415b-bdf4-8ec835d98174-1
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.188
tired and you realize that this
**** doesn't work anymore,

7f6f772e-2fd9-415b-bdf4-8ec835d98174-2
00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:05.560
right?

d75133b1-5b58-46bf-991c-7db7ac1a5861-0
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.100
You have to be willing to look in the mirror and go, my crap

d75133b1-5b58-46bf-991c-7db7ac1a5861-1
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.320
doesn't work anymore.

5256a678-3442-4d57-9f58-7e2e8a767edd-0
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.560
I need help.

61ed8b48-d618-46d4-b469-097b61bb842f-0
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.520
That's the You have to come to your knees.

d9ae9db8-9f71-4b13-85e4-61203f6abb59-0
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.699
And you were on your knees, number one, and and humble

d9ae9db8-9f71-4b13-85e4-61203f6abb59-1
00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.280
enough to ask for help.

86e4ad76-78e6-4318-9464-2b1f9cb9a06e-0
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.233
And then #2, you were dedicated and committed and you trusted,

86e4ad76-78e6-4318-9464-2b1f9cb9a06e-1
00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:25.800
right?

ec34f21c-128e-44da-a9f9-a445ea5b0df8-0
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.626
You surrendered your trust to me and then followed like, and I

ec34f21c-128e-44da-a9f9-a445ea5b0df8-1
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:33.331
hate to talk like that, like, because I sound like like, oh,

ec34f21c-128e-44da-a9f9-a445ea5b0df8-2
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:36.672
we have to be dictators if you're a therapist, but you

ec34f21c-128e-44da-a9f9-a445ea5b0df8-3
00:03:36.672 --> 00:03:38.920
followed step by step, step by step.

0284e22b-9ed8-459f-9390-9ed5ab79392d-0
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.753
And many times we we went backwards and forwards and

0284e22b-9ed8-459f-9390-9ed5ab79392d-1
00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:44.480
backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards.

3c529274-e14f-4ddb-831c-2029362c6e3c-0
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.656
But that is the that is the process to to growth and it

3c529274-e14f-4ddb-831c-2029362c6e3c-1
00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:51.320
takes time, right.

8ec118c4-2614-4f3e-9cbc-24915f991c95-0
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.442
Who you are today is not who you were in the beginning and it's

8ec118c4-2614-4f3e-9cbc-24915f991c95-1
00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:59.548
hard to do believe that but you trust it and I think trust is is

8ec118c4-2614-4f3e-9cbc-24915f991c95-2
00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:03.338
what you gave me and that's that's so rare to find somebody

8ec118c4-2614-4f3e-9cbc-24915f991c95-3
00:04:03.338 --> 00:04:07.507
that you can trust and that they can hold you and they don't drop

8ec118c4-2614-4f3e-9cbc-24915f991c95-4
00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:07.760
you.

bb861d99-a384-477a-8467-36374bbee5d0-0
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.120
And that's why therapy and a coach are such valuable

bb861d99-a384-477a-8467-36374bbee5d0-1
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.331
processes because if you find a good therapist they will re

bb861d99-a384-477a-8467-36374bbee5d0-2
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.560
parent you and re rebirth you into a new way.

aa3c29d9-2452-4aef-ae6f-c82156cae52d-0
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.640
But you did all the work.

35fcb6a3-a218-4a0e-befc-84a044f7634c-0
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.203
You know you somebody's asking you why you're crying because it

35fcb6a3-a218-4a0e-befc-84a044f7634c-1
00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:27.960
because I it does feel like a rebirth.

ca280f3e-b29e-4d81-86c8-fe2fb61f6ccb-0
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.040
It does feel like I was born again.

d1dd84d4-ffb6-4f99-a61f-de9e82a825eb-0
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.385
I when I think about myself last year, it was around my birthday

d1dd84d4-ffb6-4f99-a61f-de9e82a825eb-1
00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:38.480
in June and it was just life was so empty on the inside and so

d1dd84d4-ffb6-4f99-a61f-de9e82a825eb-2
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.000
painful.

4aef974a-f2bf-4998-93a4-5ee8a004bd48-0
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.989
The suffering was at its peak to the point that I had forgotten

4aef974a-f2bf-4998-93a4-5ee8a004bd48-1
00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.920
that it is possible to feel joy on the inside.

f67d60f8-f681-493e-9fb5-2a19bed4ee9b-0
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.200
And then when I met you, it was like you were my last resort.

6ef5fbb0-b37a-465d-b9b1-e65eb1a09736-0
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.769
I was like, if I don't trust her, I can not trust anybody

6ef5fbb0-b37a-465d-b9b1-e65eb1a09736-1
00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:55.160
else.

95e980e3-3614-4eb1-ba40-d2c174d77c8f-0
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.887
So I was like, I'm just gonna go into it benignly because this is

95e980e3-3614-4eb1-ba40-d2c174d77c8f-1
00:04:59.887 --> 00:05:04.400
my last resort and a year later everything has changed for me.

c46f8bcc-ff0b-48c7-93f4-6c19ed76d737-0
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.559
And then the crazy thing is when you change internally, your

c46f8bcc-ff0b-48c7-93f4-6c19ed76d737-1
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.400
external world does change.

1d61e51a-3ada-42da-a2ef-ab2adb099053-0
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.640
Like all the magic stuff is real.

da436b2c-7978-45d8-bb3a-c2b333904f75-0
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.480
So what was.

c8e806cf-c25f-4df5-984b-4cf090c4be0a-0
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.800
So let me translate that.

793ead46-db14-4d32-bf32-f12f01549411-0
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.560
So first, you know, the process of healing takes time.

6adfd0de-8d03-41d0-8e20-403fc83255c4-0
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.879
Then it takes humility and it takes a willingness to look at

6adfd0de-8d03-41d0-8e20-403fc83255c4-1
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.200
your shadow, right.

1f5384ad-c7a3-4134-8b6d-2c72c56323e7-0
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.086
So what we did together, what I
teach people in my work, and I'm

1f5384ad-c7a3-4134-8b6d-2c72c56323e7-1
00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:32.000
having a big event in two weeks.

72262620-5be6-4d0d-8ec8-924e2b95639b-0
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.880
You're coming for it.

f18b6e9c-0dfd-42cf-ba0a-f34f2282e5ed-0
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.445
And what I'm going to teach at the event evolve is that you

f18b6e9c-0dfd-42cf-ba0a-f34f2282e5ed-1
00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:39.120
have to be willing to look at your patterns.

c71ca939-5745-46c9-9e8b-af18e7f5f423-0
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.520
Right.

7b466345-919e-4b1c-8fee-a9916a46d5ba-0
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.875
When, Megan, you began to realize, oh, my God, I'm in a

7b466345-919e-4b1c-8fee-a9916a46d5ba-1
00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:44.440
pattern.

88da75cc-b82d-4857-9e5d-a9c82964c4d1-0
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.240
And many times, Megan, you were so cute.

5698c045-66dc-442e-b787-9ea0b6c40a11-0
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.400
You would be like, what is this pattern called?

c0aa377c-05ac-411a-94ac-de36923ad340-0
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.000
And I would come up with a name.

4d8c3736-c4c8-416e-95e0-5ec707eec034-0
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.640
I don't know, but I think it's called this.

ea641faf-db72-4e06-839e-8f01cf06c822-0
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.880
But it's it's it's what?

6f030f90-147f-4f69-b4d6-b01e28fff647-0
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.840
What is The point of that is you begin to label your patterns.

21b98160-1ebc-48e7-9536-3760fd506f1d-0
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.655
You begin to see that, damn, I'm doing the same thing over and

21b98160-1ebc-48e7-9536-3760fd506f1d-1
00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:02.000
over.

1245c159-0529-44ff-8bb0-d09d53782113-0
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.809
And what you did so beautifully, which is so important, is that

1245c159-0529-44ff-8bb0-d09d53782113-1
00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:09.520
you began to take a pause before you started the next pattern.

e9263c18-230a-46ae-9789-f35f8f249dbd-0
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.880
Like the same pattern, right.

bec6a631-b857-4c97-9423-4a2026d09a8d-0
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.920
So you began to take a pause.

f1c8736d-36a0-4fec-8bdf-fa7ec11746b0-0
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.960
And that's what people do, say in Alcoholics Anonymous.

ecd14636-e65b-487a-bc2b-1b4bb93f9eb1-0
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.800
When they have the urge to drink, they call the sponsor.

3692d50a-80f6-47e9-8fa0-bd6a204a1cbe-0
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.800
When you have the urge to repeat the pattern, you called me,

3692d50a-80f6-47e9-8fa0-bd6a204a1cbe-1
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.080
right?

95ad84a8-5065-4013-81c2-e8d82073a072-0
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.943
So you create a pause, and then you begin to realize, OK, I

95ad84a8-5065-4013-81c2-e8d82073a072-1
00:06:25.943 --> 00:06:28.080
don't have to do the same pattern.

30de3743-2ceb-49c6-bd23-e9776e797993-0
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.360
I can go a different way.

5dcfedaa-758c-4033-9bd0-05a4ab136f0d-0
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.463
And this is the power of the work I do, which is to give

5dcfedaa-758c-4033-9bd0-05a4ab136f0d-1
00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:34.000
choices.

54b37234-6af9-4141-8db5-a23460b05696-0
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.516
And when you begin to, you know, act out a new choice, you're

54b37234-6af9-4141-8db5-a23460b05696-1
00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:40.160
like, wow, wow, I did it.

53a4b32a-ab21-4422-9521-f65639a1825e-0
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.858
Like there were days when you did new things and you were

53a4b32a-ab21-4422-9521-f65639a1825e-1
00:06:42.858 --> 00:06:44.040
like, oh, my God, I did it.

a2c50f40-5246-41f1-8108-c45b895e3ea2-0
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.400
I did it.

04d3705e-8093-4970-883e-8e3060977ba2-0
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.760
I did it.

1801ece4-51bd-4c06-b892-19d42059c73a-0
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.120
I did it.

4d8f9a58-89e5-4c8b-879d-83c3538ccfe5-0
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.653
And this is, this is the process of starting to walk all over

4d8f9a58-89e5-4c8b-879d-83c3538ccfe5-1
00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:50.520
again, right?

3d410618-846a-4885-96b9-050db7336b36-0
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.120
You learn to walk all over again.

4488e948-fe0f-4cbd-b40f-814fe8131f0a-0
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.486
This is the power of of the work, of the consciousness

4488e948-fe0f-4cbd-b40f-814fe8131f0a-1
00:06:55.486 --> 00:06:59.097
movement, of this beautiful work where you learn to become

4488e948-fe0f-4cbd-b40f-814fe8131f0a-2
00:06:59.097 --> 00:07:02.769
conscious and you're becoming so conscious, you're becoming

4488e948-fe0f-4cbd-b40f-814fe8131f0a-3
00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:03.320
awakened.

b612a2cd-7df2-4f4c-a76b-c28cd6abd2bb-0
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.760
That's such a beautiful gift.

ce9e85a7-07f9-4b11-9dd1-97ed5827cd3e-0
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.560
It's the most beautiful gift
I've ever been given.

62173159-3071-4b22-94a4-bc07fc26f97d-0
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.805
And before I dive in, I want to add this one more thing for the

62173159-3071-4b22-94a4-bc07fc26f97d-1
00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:12.800
audience, guys.

4ae19c64-b242-4690-8d23-8e6a54ee8e0c-0
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800
Doctor Shapali restored my faith in humanity.

59a13355-1a80-4e0f-96cf-4c0354d8cf81-0
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.694
If you're at a point in your life where you're like, I cannot

59a13355-1a80-4e0f-96cf-4c0354d8cf81-1
00:07:18.694 --> 00:07:20.440
trust anybody, everybody will dump me.

f150a43d-04c6-4294-88b2-eb88d27fd221-0
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.120
I was that girl.

9a5a36ee-6ac4-4d59-b326-cc796e5bff6c-0
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.007
I was that insecure girl that couldn't trust that anybody will

9a5a36ee-6ac4-4d59-b326-cc796e5bff6c-1
00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:28.040
keep loving me and won't drop me.

86a5ce39-fd72-4bc4-aeb4-b7da59c44e18-0
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.200
I was just waiting for the next person to drop me.

99c380f8-7279-488b-ac26-82d3d1cb653e-0
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.280
Men, women, didn't matter.

aa9df2e3-a5a2-4180-8f7c-91f66673a9cc-0
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.618
I was just waiting for the next person to say, you know what,

aa9df2e3-a5a2-4180-8f7c-91f66673a9cc-1
00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:36.480
enough of Megan.

19aebb19-9821-4120-82e0-c9d5d2d3688f-0
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.680
I'm going to abandon her.

0792d718-b269-487c-94a4-fe7a7f3a490c-0
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.022
But there are people out there that are willing to sacrifice

0792d718-b269-487c-94a4-fe7a7f3a490c-1
00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:45.826
for you and to help you to find you as a diamond in the rough

0792d718-b269-487c-94a4-fe7a7f3a490c-2
00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:47.360
and really Polish you up.

4e2a6f83-c4ce-42d5-a78f-b1a53581c0b5-0
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.600
And Doctor Chapal, you did that for me.

d633f5a7-e8fa-4b89-8401-af2f268b2eb6-0
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.320
And that is something that I
will forever cherish.

6c05cf4e-b890-4e43-a6b9-e16b9e3794e2-0
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.710
And it's just my duty to try to help other women awaken and

6c05cf4e-b890-4e43-a6b9-e16b9e3794e2-1
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.320
touch their hearts so they're open to receiving help from you.

774f07b9-3ff6-4db7-8f79-86b5c848026f-0
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.800
And so I'm ready to dive in.

dc178fd9-8baa-4175-b870-348b5666acf6-0
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.341
So my first, my very first experience with you was when I

dc178fd9-8baa-4175-b870-348b5666acf6-1
00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:10.160
read your book Radical
Awakening.

7f69a802-00ae-4450-9f22-6cecbfae39ca-0
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.120
And it was a radical awakening.

92080411-f14a-4dc5-92f0-c18e938f671c-0
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.520
I'm like, wow, what is this woman talking about?

d361f916-ecce-4960-8543-aa51e52a703f-0
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.640
What is radical awakening And living with consciousness.

d304d2c3-b090-4686-9634-418742fffd9c-0
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.200
What does it really mean to become conscious?

f8b2231e-4727-4836-9e73-c23bdd947ebb-0
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.320
Well, to radically awaken means to do 2 things.

ca9bc5b5-9146-4a84-bb85-9e9aa458f907-0
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.320
You have to heal from the messaging from your childhood.

69cd3da4-f32a-4858-9d29-20504d1b829d-0
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.480
All of us, or many of us.

bc304386-be29-48eb-bdce-b2e0966b8d31-0
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.364
Most of us were raised with lies, from our parents,

bc304386-be29-48eb-bdce-b2e0966b8d31-1
00:08:36.364 --> 00:08:37.560
unconsciousness.

763d029f-9829-4925-9b48-cbd3d07ee9f4-0
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.570
So maybe we had a mother or a father who said you're not

763d029f-9829-4925-9b48-cbd3d07ee9f4-1
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.793
beautiful, you're not worthy, you're not significant, you're

763d029f-9829-4925-9b48-cbd3d07ee9f4-2
00:08:43.793 --> 00:08:44.480
not powerful.

69430e04-ffdd-47b9-892a-a66e7d6e20af-0
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.514
So the first part of radically awakening is to change these

69430e04-ffdd-47b9-892a-a66e7d6e20af-1
00:08:48.514 --> 00:08:50.000
messages from childhood.

6b5f99fb-8328-47c6-8a5a-f4de23272b2b-0
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.818
And then the second part of radical awakening is to change

6b5f99fb-8328-47c6-8a5a-f4de23272b2b-1
00:08:54.818 --> 00:08:55.480
cultures.

88762cd1-1919-4841-9edc-76561a97d65e-0
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.960
Messages inside you like what we women have been told.

74ecd6f3-bdca-4615-97f6-09bc521d6c36-0
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.163
That you need to be skinny, or you need to be beautiful, or you

74ecd6f3-bdca-4615-97f6-09bc521d6c36-1
00:09:02.163 --> 00:09:03.560
need to have a man on your arm.

7042f0cc-f3c0-49a1-aa0f-2e123241e30e-0
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.920
These are the lies we women have been told.

e9e2585a-3ef7-4b69-ae8e-5cd9f8ce0aef-0
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.149
So to radically awaken is to begin to examine your belief

e9e2585a-3ef7-4b69-ae8e-5cd9f8ce0aef-1
00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:14.742
systems and deconstruct them and discard them, disrupt them so

e9e2585a-3ef7-4b69-ae8e-5cd9f8ce0aef-2
00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:19.190
that you can begin to live with consciousness and choice and

e9e2585a-3ef7-4b69-ae8e-5cd9f8ce0aef-3
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.920
awareness.

b66da657-79f0-4080-af20-bbff38d2e4c6-0
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.952
And then you really helped me find my authentic self through

b66da657-79f0-4080-af20-bbff38d2e4c6-1
00:09:24.952 --> 00:09:28.520
shedding years of trauma and layers after layers.

e2723275-49e4-4cf8-85a1-801bdf7ebff4-0
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.960
And then you started to address ego.

d3cf9be1-de1d-44b1-8953-c4197c6a8f37-0
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.760
What is that ego that's killing all of us?

e5fad31e-f3af-414f-8f52-d15d4b1be789-0
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.680
So in childhood because our authentic self was not seen.

fa58ff62-da13-49c5-85aa-517a078787c9-0
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.549
So in when childhood we all had a voice and we knew our voice

fa58ff62-da13-49c5-85aa-517a078787c9-1
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:44.280
and we knew what we liked and we knew what we didn't like.

3be44007-bd3e-4ab1-887c-59b9adaa3794-0
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.724
But if it didn't match with our parents, they told us no, no,

3be44007-bd3e-4ab1-887c-59b9adaa3794-1
00:09:48.724 --> 00:09:50.920
no, no, you can't do that, right?

d648982b-657e-463d-9034-fa8fc8770fb5-0
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.823
So you have to create a fake self, a false self to please

d648982b-657e-463d-9034-fa8fc8770fb5-1
00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:55.160
them.

97661a95-b6fa-4497-ad30-07e86c7a92bd-0
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.320
And that fake false self is what we call the ego.

10f6019a-0fd7-4f66-a855-3541d0a33141-0
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.705
So in in reclaiming your authentic self, you have to

10f6019a-0fd7-4f66-a855-3541d0a33141-1
00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:03.240
learn to listen to yourself.

293a1d34-8f87-4945-b078-1bed033b8f59-0
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.400
So you have to always go back.

b5d90a22-9971-4fe5-9711-d2d711ed4a5d-0
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.360
What do you think?

619ebc8a-ea01-4ae4-8b93-4ef881140190-0
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.600
What do I believe in?

8667bc03-e18b-4196-9556-091df9fb9a86-0
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.127
You have to go inward and stop looking for answers on the

8667bc03-e18b-4196-9556-091df9fb9a86-1
00:10:10.127 --> 00:10:11.040
outside, right?

8fe0bf02-21d1-4de9-b7d4-ad9700c13f2a-0
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.100
And that process is very hard because we women especially are

8fe0bf02-21d1-4de9-b7d4-ad9700c13f2a-1
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.292
addicted to finding answers to our relationships through people

8fe0bf02-21d1-4de9-b7d4-ad9700c13f2a-2
00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:22.960
who have money to through, you know, through influence.

ecd93b2b-7d6d-4d43-af2a-6adf89be33c1-0
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960
And we don't know how to look inside.

37448a41-17de-42c3-929b-97c5b394c8d1-0
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.680
So then it's so interesting.

21b90dee-9173-44ea-b7ee-9f284da98aab-0
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.251
Once I did the work with you and you really, I always say, I

21b90dee-9173-44ea-b7ee-9f284da98aab-1
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:33.600
always say Doctor Shefali polished me up.

e051876e-00ff-44e1-ac85-6fc44bae88b5-0
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.531
She really you remove layers and layers of trauma to find my

e051876e-00ff-44e1-ac85-6fc44bae88b5-1
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:40.680
authentic self that was buried underneath all of that.

8761507d-efcb-4dbe-989c-50fe7d5e9225-0
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.600
My authentic self.

6f8811af-96c2-4dc4-8293-0f1c648238ab-0
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.052
I'm back to my 5 year old with wisdom this time, but I'm

6f8811af-96c2-4dc4-8293-0f1c648238ab-1
00:10:47.052 --> 00:10:51.718
remembering myself when I was a kid and all the stuff that would

6f8811af-96c2-4dc4-8293-0f1c648238ab-2
00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:56.241
give me joy, they're all back to me when it comes to authentic

6f8811af-96c2-4dc4-8293-0f1c648238ab-3
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:56.600
self.

b88382a3-0030-481d-b936-f5d4f67d37cd-0
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.600
How can we help women go back to who they were before the

b88382a3-0030-481d-b936-f5d4f67d37cd-1
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.880
traumas, before the social conditioning?

8ade83c2-e84d-478c-bd27-d7ddcaaa543d-0
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.920
Yeah, it takes, it takes a long time, it takes work.

9245bf5f-62e1-4cff-b624-aba3f94930de-0
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.793
And that's why I teach my courses that take time or doing

9245bf5f-62e1-4cff-b624-aba3f94930de-1
00:11:12.793 --> 00:11:16.200
this weekend evolve in two weeks, which is 4 days.

5d6b2e2b-3720-4195-a040-40a81082ebd4-0
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.000
Why?

34e5a1c7-7b8e-43cd-8136-88bc78dc772e-0
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.325
Because it's serious, You know, if you want to take your

34e5a1c7-7b8e-43cd-8136-88bc78dc772e-1
00:11:20.325 --> 00:11:23.360
emotional health seriously, you have to spend time.

c9bbcfb2-31b5-4cc8-8f56-c08f98a74bb3-0
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.000
We spend time on our jobs.

ace8c2f4-241b-4270-824d-fc6aa32a2720-0
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.232
We spend time making money or making our bodies better, but we

ace8c2f4-241b-4270-824d-fc6aa32a2720-1
00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:29.720
don't spend the time to heal.

1ad24a66-7ea0-4830-9ea2-56fafae70027-0
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:35.222
So you go through this process of uncovering the layers and and

1ad24a66-7ea0-4830-9ea2-56fafae70027-1
00:11:35.222 --> 00:11:40.640
slowly you peel back to where you once were before the trauma.

54f1d0e6-5d0a-4b74-a67d-a61228338b38-0
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.327
But it takes a whole process and it's such a powerful process and

54f1d0e6-5d0a-4b74-a67d-a61228338b38-1
00:11:45.327 --> 00:11:49.363
and like you, many people who go through it, after a year or

54f1d0e6-5d0a-4b74-a67d-a61228338b38-2
00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:53.532
after six months, they're reborn and they feel such great love

54f1d0e6-5d0a-4b74-a67d-a61228338b38-3
00:11:53.532 --> 00:11:57.040
for themselves again that they had forgotten, right.

09d5b3a7-add2-487f-96d5-5fdbc972e3be-0
00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.800
Correct.

8cce9ec7-4a10-4f34-82ef-ea91df0747b7-0
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.960
And then what is.

fd0d215d-23fd-4272-88b6-0a7934ed4662-0
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.687
So we're guys as you know,
Doctor Shefali is hosting her

fd0d215d-23fd-4272-88b6-0a7934ed4662-1
00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:06.676
wonderful annual event called
Evolve in Atlanta October 21st

fd0d215d-23fd-4272-88b6-0a7934ed4662-2
00:12:06.676 --> 00:12:07.199
to 24th.

e63ecefd-7f4e-4e95-a4e5-30bf2e951618-0
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.871
And we're taking a group of women in need that Doctor

e63ecefd-7f4e-4e95-a4e5-30bf2e951618-1
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:14.748
Shefali, with the generosity of her heart, is supporting and is

e63ecefd-7f4e-4e95-a4e5-30bf2e951618-2
00:12:14.748 --> 00:12:15.959
helping them awaken.

b15a3ca6-9765-4030-b804-65277990b8b6-0
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:16.960
Chavali.

f11ec467-7c1d-40a6-b3b9-6a17392496f9-0
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.800
What's the first step to the awakening process?

75946200-7592-4385-a433-03a02aadd9a1-0
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.670
Like when people are coming to
EVOLVE, what is the first step

75946200-7592-4385-a433-03a02aadd9a1-1
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.920
you're taking them through?

60c3da91-1214-413b-85d6-de3941e918a0-0
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.400
Let me ask you, can you still hear me?

ce1af6e7-5ead-4610-aff2-a2da5296fa54-0
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.280
Yes.

36226354-817b-4e22-bbff-7c27d95eb9fe-0
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.040
OK.

c9a74466-e75c-4138-9f62-a5d54d196b0b-0
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.403
So the first step at Evolve when people come to my seminar is

c9a74466-e75c-4138-9f62-a5d54d196b0b-1
00:12:33.403 --> 00:12:37.304
that they are going to begin to understand their biggest

c9a74466-e75c-4138-9f62-a5d54d196b0b-2
00:12:37.304 --> 00:12:37.920
triggers.

08510df8-a7d2-467a-b513-447658dfe052-0
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.840
So we always start with the biggest pain points, right?

df8fbc66-38d8-4443-a301-e4d69603024e-0
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.400
What is hurting you now?

678c278f-ba11-46a8-ac2e-a950b81e1ef2-0
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.413
And when I begin to help people deconstruct the biggest triggers

678c278f-ba11-46a8-ac2e-a950b81e1ef2-1
00:12:48.413 --> 00:12:52.248
in their lives, it takes them straight to their greatest

678c278f-ba11-46a8-ac2e-a950b81e1ef2-2
00:12:52.248 --> 00:12:52.720
trauma.

0249e92b-3d8b-4c3f-bea2-04022963b6e3-0
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.831
And through our pain we begin to understand how we're Co creating

0249e92b-3d8b-4c3f-bea2-04022963b6e3-1
00:12:58.831 --> 00:13:00.000
our suffering.

ba88eed0-7865-44ba-b4ea-0d240ebc80d0-0
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.794
And you know so for example many people who are coming up parents

ba88eed0-7865-44ba-b4ea-0d240ebc80d0-1
00:13:03.794 --> 00:13:06.989
so they have conflict with their children and they think it's the

ba88eed0-7865-44ba-b4ea-0d240ebc80d0-2
00:13:06.989 --> 00:13:10.135
children's fault or we have many people who are in relationships

ba88eed0-7865-44ba-b4ea-0d240ebc80d0-3
00:13:10.135 --> 00:13:12.749
who believe it's the relationship, the other person's

ba88eed0-7865-44ba-b4ea-0d240ebc80d0-4
00:13:12.749 --> 00:13:13.040
fault.

eeb0343e-f168-4aad-b25e-de5351a46f83-0
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.440
And slowly I show them how they are Co creating.

37e4f7e8-77c5-49f5-88fc-df290b642392-0
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.026
They're not the only ones but they're not fully victims

37e4f7e8-77c5-49f5-88fc-df290b642392-1
00:13:21.026 --> 00:13:21.440
either.

8dd6546b-25d3-4cc0-88f5-177330c36391-0
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.344
They are Co creating the reality and when you begin to see it in

8dd6546b-25d3-4cc0-88f5-177330c36391-1
00:13:26.344 --> 00:13:29.760
real time, you begin to make different choices.

ec2ad45c-d98c-46ba-bc2e-149eb405823b-0
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.256
So that's what I'm going to lead people through emotional

ec2ad45c-d98c-46ba-bc2e-149eb405823b-1
00:13:33.256 --> 00:13:36.632
exercises to show them how they've been living the same

ec2ad45c-d98c-46ba-bc2e-149eb405823b-2
00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:38.319
pattern over and over again.

6a002167-7ba4-46d3-9c98-6d550abe7021-0
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.051
So when as a woman, when you come to Evolve, you're going to

6a002167-7ba4-46d3-9c98-6d550abe7021-1
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:45.600
first start to address the main point of trauma, correct?

068d6a1c-af69-489d-80b7-051e6d8ba5a1-0
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.440
What are the curriculums?

799edcd5-1f2d-46c2-af53-0587857f166f-0
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.680
Walk me through the process.

af75e637-aeb5-4930-8a70-816324b659b7-0
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.848
I I know the process, but I'm super excited for other women to

af75e637-aeb5-4930-8a70-816324b659b7-1
00:13:52.848 --> 00:13:55.600
benefit from it, other people in general.

157e2420-7e24-4695-a796-98f0c2742814-0
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.000
But obviously I have a soft spot for women, right?

9bc32c7f-9f5c-4172-b707-38711db88f46-0
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.880
So in at Evolve, my summit, we are going to go through.

fe93e0d1-fb1f-4c38-8643-81d10b80ca66-0
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.246
I don't have the exact order of things, but we're going to

fe93e0d1-fb1f-4c38-8643-81d10b80ca66-1
00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:11.982
understand our triggers, disrupt our patterns, find new ways of

fe93e0d1-fb1f-4c38-8643-81d10b80ca66-2
00:14:11.982 --> 00:14:13.240
relating choices.

72a9860d-9339-4f87-a9f2-3b3a6ef61ca3-0
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.120
What does it mean to have a choice?

048e2504-ecbe-4bd8-9e21-ea81ff14932e-0
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.840
And we're going to practice that.

acbf7d31-f6ed-4de2-80b2-1e428a30e4fd-0
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.508
So when people leave, evolve, they leave with the tools and

acbf7d31-f6ed-4de2-80b2-1e428a30e4fd-1
00:14:20.508 --> 00:14:24.192
strategies to go back into their old relationships with actual

acbf7d31-f6ed-4de2-80b2-1e428a30e4fd-2
00:14:24.192 --> 00:14:27.760
strategies and choices that they have practiced all weekend.

e6822872-a6cb-49d1-980b-7ba2c85aae43-0
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.480
So when you come, you're going to see.

dd5a1e4c-4239-465d-9bb1-7cc1c0cc9af3-0
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.271
I can't give a lot away, but I'm going to keep helping people

dd5a1e4c-4239-465d-9bb1-7cc1c0cc9af3-1
00:14:33.271 --> 00:14:35.840
understand their their main ego triggers.

1b48033a-6469-441d-8e3f-8ac0d1414aa9-0
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.480
That's the main thing in healing.

3d954aea-920f-4d50-ab32-d1d38ab0d31a-0
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.880
You have to see how triggered you get and why.

6d718ffe-a556-4115-8f17-76645168ff01-0
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.050
And once you understand the why, then you can do the how how to

6d718ffe-a556-4115-8f17-76645168ff01-1
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.480
change.

3efe033d-c891-472b-8e97-28f112d9ff37-0
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.960
But if you don't understand the why, you won't do the how.

929fe8f0-8bb9-408b-bb41-bd02c989ac5b-0
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.267
So the first step is really looking at yourself from the

929fe8f0-8bb9-408b-bb41-bd02c989ac5b-1
00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:53.760
outside.

8b53f24e-f6e5-4e4a-877c-1fa05e34d85d-0
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.440
Yes.

8501a081-b627-4cd5-a2ea-0f9e4b6f2da7-0
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:54.960
Yes.

3419d0aa-80a7-4fe7-8a93-3fe7d37c515c-0
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.320
Like a like a specimen in a laboratory.

d02def79-a4cd-429e-8038-0573ab964465-0
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.480
It's like looking yourself from the outside in.

69174125-2ad7-42c7-9954-bc40e090b0e3-0
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.080
And then you begin to create changes from inside out.

bc2404d7-3f91-4ee5-943f-d67a1b09664e-0
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:05.760
Right.

854793c3-faca-4f90-b09c-09ac6b79383e-0
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.480
Wow.

e231ac47-3826-493b-8e80-2046752c5860-0
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.760
Yeah, so I want to add something.

796c79d8-f89b-4230-bcf2-9a50b66eccef-0
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.222
This is the first time in my life since age 15 that I'm

796c79d8-f89b-4230-bcf2-9a50b66eccef-1
00:15:13.222 --> 00:15:18.321
single and I'm not looking for validation by having a man by my

796c79d8-f89b-4230-bcf2-9a50b66eccef-2
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:18.720
side.

6adb2b2a-dece-493a-857a-78b5bf449894-0
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.000
For 15 years, I was conditioned that I'm only good enough.

80ebe417-6ec5-4397-9ea4-58781b52925f-0
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.173
I'm only good enough if they're
I have a boyfriend or I have a

80ebe417-6ec5-4397-9ea4-58781b52925f-1
00:15:25.173 --> 00:15:26.400
partner that validates me.

b62126ae-8efd-4e4f-b5e5-3a40253a7c85-0
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.960
And I'm here because you helped me.

5001e02c-9c91-449f-b30a-b11bcdff2df0-0
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.250
For women out there that are seeking validation through their

5001e02c-9c91-449f-b30a-b11bcdff2df0-1
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.605
romantic partner, if they were to come to evolve, how how do

5001e02c-9c91-449f-b30a-b11bcdff2df0-2
00:15:36.605 --> 00:15:39.850
you think we can help them transcend this belief, limiting

5001e02c-9c91-449f-b30a-b11bcdff2df0-3
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.600
belief that their value comes from their partner?

62c52a60-8450-4a02-8e9c-88ca2ac404ae-0
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.250
Well, so first is to understand that they've been given that

62c52a60-8450-4a02-8e9c-88ca2ac404ae-1
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.600
information as data and that that data is wrong.

50f11e7b-9271-4265-878a-6b7a0417962d-0
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.640
So at first, just the awareness that wow, it could be a lie.

c208d04f-52b4-487c-95c2-b7aa3d95429b-0
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.703
Wow, the other women out there who have divorced or who are not

c208d04f-52b4-487c-95c2-b7aa3d95429b-1
00:15:57.703 --> 00:16:00.160
in a relationship, and wow, look at them.

d46f9812-995f-4196-9bff-aea42cebb793-0
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.440
They look like you.

ff8216af-a1e6-453f-9e1e-6b281194b785-0
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.760
They look so worthy.

776e2b40-f3d9-458c-9841-4071778529c3-0
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.000
They look so confident.

f4cfda57-0582-4dc4-8aba-c6f06874e612-0
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.600
Wow, How does she do it?

46cf451b-76f5-4c5a-b53d-a6066a19c92f-0
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.022
And then through listening to each other's stories, we realize

46cf451b-76f5-4c5a-b53d-a6066a19c92f-1
00:16:09.022 --> 00:16:12.204
that, wow, they do it because they have found something inside

46cf451b-76f5-4c5a-b53d-a6066a19c92f-2
00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:12.760
themselves.

a82e79d3-3880-45b9-a05c-5cd0a4aaa746-0
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.592
And once we allow women to tap into their own friendship, their

a82e79d3-3880-45b9-a05c-5cd0a4aaa746-1
00:16:17.592 --> 00:16:21.608
own companionship, their own best soulmate, that's within

a82e79d3-3880-45b9-a05c-5cd0a4aaa746-2
00:16:21.608 --> 00:16:22.440
them, right?

91b3e218-c71a-4071-8296-646c02c00338-0
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.913
That's what's missing is we didn't think that the

91b3e218-c71a-4071-8296-646c02c00338-1
00:16:24.913 --> 00:16:27.040
relationship with ourselves was important.

cb840c5d-1135-4af4-a351-200cb0d0522b-0
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.312
We were never told that the relationship to ourselves is

cb840c5d-1135-4af4-a351-200cb0d0522b-1
00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:30.880
important.

224330f7-4c34-41d6-a53f-b1f3d4be931b-0
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.599
We were always told the relationship to our parents,

224330f7-4c34-41d6-a53f-b1f3d4be931b-1
00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:36.266
relationship to God, relationship to our boyfriends

224330f7-4c34-41d6-a53f-b1f3d4be931b-2
00:16:36.266 --> 00:16:38.986
and the men in our lives was more important than the

224330f7-4c34-41d6-a53f-b1f3d4be931b-3
00:16:38.986 --> 00:16:40.319
relationship to ourselves.

d514bbaa-4868-4081-86ec-6f1a4516fb05-0
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.159
And that's the fundamental key to spiritual awakening is when

d514bbaa-4868-4081-86ec-6f1a4516fb05-1
00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:47.642
you realize that you, you, yourself, and your connection to

d514bbaa-4868-4081-86ec-6f1a4516fb05-2
00:16:47.642 --> 00:16:51.009
yourself is the greatest medicine, the greatest bomb, the

d514bbaa-4868-4081-86ec-6f1a4516fb05-3
00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:53.679
most money in the world, the greatest wealth.

14d2f319-11f5-443c-87de-493c88c6769b-0
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.000
That is the power that changes the world.

416781fc-8a04-4fdf-bebf-bc89d04b3f67-0
00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.320
Wow.

d5fb6ffd-f2ac-4980-bfe4-058c4ec0ac21-0
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.360
So guys, come to EVOLVE.

21769c65-aaa0-4a27-b029-9bb8e28780ee-0
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.800
Join me at EVOLVE.

65e042f0-0343-439b-ac21-b6ca26b8133a-0
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.760
I'm urging you.

7fc36189-0d09-4e58-be69-74afb97b0a05-0
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.940
I'm asking you because the gift you're going to receive during

7fc36189-0d09-4e58-be69-74afb97b0a05-1
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.991
this seminar, you cannot compare it with anything else you've

7fc36189-0d09-4e58-be69-74afb97b0a05-2
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:09.680
ever received.

a4a6b540-957e-427a-b495-7099744c1339-0
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.492
It's going to be the most precious thing you've ever

a4a6b540-957e-427a-b495-7099744c1339-1
00:17:11.492 --> 00:17:11.800
received.

c80b4339-0f40-4ae7-8c15-b9620bca3b7c-0
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.240
You're going to receive you.

57d72ec7-1042-4d8b-bc5e-08f4dc343ff4-0
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.960
You're gonna find you.

fc0a9cf5-407d-4709-ad76-bd8edd61d1a0-0
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.028
Because when you said a relationship with yourself, I

fc0a9cf5-407d-4709-ad76-bd8edd61d1a0-1
00:17:18.028 --> 00:17:20.160
used to feel lonely when I was alone.

9aa18a90-f418-43e2-aa8d-49c7cbd5564a-0
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.640
I used to avoid being by myself.

43833d75-0184-428d-aa43-d7418037387f-0
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.440
And I didn't know why.

cb4bc002-a07b-4816-8535-6c996e949a83-0
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.840
I'm like, what's the point of life if I'm supposed to be by

cb4bc002-a07b-4816-8535-6c996e949a83-1
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.120
myself?

982507f6-67f5-4519-9fb4-ab4f43cdb75b-0
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.280
When you have a relationship with yourself?

7a44c5fe-aa2c-4867-8550-ea15fe584c28-0
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.438
There is a soul mate, there is a sister, there is a mother,

7a44c5fe-aa2c-4867-8550-ea15fe584c28-1
00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:37.640
there's a father right here that you can connect with like this.

cbb8644d-e753-48e4-8da7-2a0d3cb60ffd-0
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.840
You don't need to go anywhere.

1fc12a80-a3f3-4316-9574-ee626a96b9ee-0
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.400
It's right here with within you.

d941a4cc-e4fc-42ab-978e-5cec43080bcf-0
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.280
And Doctor Shapali helps you find you.

16d18ee9-ccb9-45ac-8145-1b03c232d5c4-0
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.764
And this if you lost, if you, if you don't know about your

16d18ee9-ccb9-45ac-8145-1b03c232d5c4-1
00:17:46.764 --> 00:17:49.648
purpose, you don't know about what what you are, what what

16d18ee9-ccb9-45ac-8145-1b03c232d5c4-2
00:17:49.648 --> 00:17:52.239
you're doing in this world, which is where I was at.

17a507f9-7aea-44d3-ad45-f5625953c32e-0
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.400
I was at a point when I reached out to you.

c41b6a8f-595b-4a3b-8434-03c514350884-0
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.627
I was like, what's the point of my existence in the world of

c41b6a8f-595b-4a3b-8434-03c514350884-1
00:17:57.627 --> 00:17:57.840
form?

f233d794-9ac7-473f-9e8e-ecff0c8ed638-0
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.600
Why am I even here?

e4668795-5479-4ac5-9986-7c07b6e68d32-0
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.320
It was.

8581732a-eb29-4c88-a126-7c4c602504b4-0
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.473
The whole point was to suffer and go through one trauma after

8581732a-eb29-4c88-a126-7c4c602504b4-1
00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:03.880
another.

4e480562-ceee-4bd3-9fd2-4b51471f1a89-0
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.600
And that is not the point of life.

0b6d2b84-4023-47fa-a30f-ac5b1d6da9c3-0
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.320
The point of life is not to survive, it is to thrive.

1d1034e1-7cbd-4b43-a8d0-0a3cd9180e35-0
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.680
And you are enabling that.

a9aa288f-e7c0-4b4b-881d-a6173afe1825-0
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.640
You're helping women find themselves helping people.

d4af0dc1-6789-4d94-8a9f-39a991b9540b-0
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.368
Sorry, I keep saying women because I just know that once we

d4af0dc1-6789-4d94-8a9f-39a991b9540b-1
00:18:17.368 --> 00:18:20.600
help women wake up, we everybody else will wake up.

b640566e-7d72-4c80-be29-dcb8fc488c06-0
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.960
Because as women, when we wake up, we force others to wake up.

3b9b0946-23ba-466f-96ba-304755870c17-0
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.560
The kids, the partners, the men, the, you know, word colleagues.

31ddf8b0-978b-4696-8d76-94aaa4cd515d-0
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.503
I want if you were to condense your message in one sentence for

31ddf8b0-978b-4696-8d76-94aaa4cd515d-1
00:18:32.503 --> 00:18:35.659
people that are looking up to you and they want to come to

31ddf8b0-978b-4696-8d76-94aaa4cd515d-2
00:18:35.659 --> 00:18:38.120
evolve to learn from you, what would that be?

1b40c3e6-909c-4bbe-81aa-8f9ca382a7d1-0
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.142
Well, you know, everybody asks for the elevator pitch, but it's

1b40c3e6-909c-4bbe-81aa-8f9ca382a7d1-1
00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:44.200
it's really hard and it changes every day.

731fff1d-bf70-4bef-bbbe-2497331975a0-0
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.561
So for today, the elevator pitch of my message is that to truly

731fff1d-bf70-4bef-bbbe-2497331975a0-1
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:54.840
be free, one has to remove all the false layers of your masks.

363e6426-4bae-406f-af45-f55947c2b20d-0
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.880
And when you do, you touch upon who it is you authentically are.

58c93f3b-d904-47e3-8347-65ac31c8a4e1-0
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.760
And there is liberation.

83442f22-56ff-479a-ab1f-35d517ca680c-0
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.760
And it's such a beautiful feeling.

409bb823-3dbe-4634-b4f7-7046f0c20996-0
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.320
You can see it in Megan's face.

c098b529-86f2-4533-8bcb-4026d0071aee-0
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.897
You know, she she looks like a load is off her because she has

c098b529-86f2-4533-8bcb-4026d0071aee-1
00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:12.240
reclaimed what she left behind in her childhood.

a0632847-3222-4178-9e2c-884d6b1ab735-0
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.598
It was always within her, but she had forgotten that she had

a0632847-3222-4178-9e2c-884d6b1ab735-1
00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:20.663
it and she just needed a mirror to remind her that she always

a0632847-3222-4178-9e2c-884d6b1ab735-2
00:19:20.663 --> 00:19:22.040
had the power within.

5a3985d2-e833-4c0d-9799-d4aa8816350e-0
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.040
And once you unleash that power, it's like explosion.

323b397a-2cd5-4903-bb02-f8107102bd5d-0
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.960
It's a volcano.

f2b26a6d-8317-47e1-beee-a9b9e663e178-0
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.480
Nothing can stop a woman, especially who refines herself.

e6cc0b9b-0270-4eb7-a07a-6696b0b055b0-0
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.666
And I say women more than men because women, I had to climb

e6cc0b9b-0270-4eb7-a07a-6696b0b055b0-1
00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:36.760
higher to reclaim their power.

d57dc779-629d-404b-8bf6-e1d48799f93a-0
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.411
You know, dig deeper because culture is kind of more cruel or

d57dc779-629d-404b-8bf6-e1d48799f93a-1
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:44.138
more hard on us and and it's not not that it's not cruel to men

d57dc779-629d-404b-8bf6-e1d48799f93a-2
00:19:44.138 --> 00:19:47.808
but you know we get it a little rougher and women of color get

d57dc779-629d-404b-8bf6-e1d48799f93a-3
00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:50.080
it rougher and and so on and so forth.

d4955c65-6a60-498f-96fb-61a738bb05b2-0
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.040
So we need to support women.

b06b2db9-dfba-4164-be2a-ac71c3a0295b-0
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.720
We need to support each other like I did for you.

be64f11b-4fab-438d-8b8d-fcc8d9d1d61f-0
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.360
You're doing for me and other women.

2cb556e1-4b36-4798-950a-ef8161bdffe0-0
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.895
Megan is trying to sponsor other women to come to Evolve and

2cb556e1-4b36-4798-950a-ef8161bdffe0-1
00:19:59.895 --> 00:20:03.198
finding money for them And this is what we do when we're

2cb556e1-4b36-4798-950a-ef8161bdffe0-2
00:20:03.198 --> 00:20:03.720
inspired.

22c7ee05-4b92-4fcd-b8d5-42ceb70938aa-0
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.240
We help other people.

3ea0fca5-d346-468d-9b5c-136f50024142-0
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:11.040
So if people are interested in coming to evolve the the website

3ea0fca5-d346-468d-9b5c-136f50024142-1
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.760

Dr.

It's all one word.

676bc815-c105-4f59-855b-9703815f2f43-0

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.375
But yeah, Megan, you're a testament to the power of this

1326e131-8ab4-4075-96fc-cf29527bef4d-1
00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:26.640
work.

1c7fae0e-ce15-4522-829d-c598101e17c1-0
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.358
And then the contagious effect, the infectious nature of

1c7fae0e-ce15-4522-829d-c598101e17c1-1
00:20:30.358 --> 00:20:30.880
healing.

0e0d425e-108e-4809-997d-3af78c73e440-0
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.280
Once you are infected with healing, you spread the word.

06b90979-9423-4682-b99d-179633c6b6e1-0
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.160
And I, I I love that you said once.

fbd88468-b7ae-4fd1-a3c8-fc4da3d59267-0
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.200
You're infected with healing guys.

83637dc3-6839-4460-b1d7-859ebedc6056-0
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.731
You are going to be infected with healing once you're at

83637dc3-6839-4460-b1d7-859ebedc6056-1
00:20:43.731 --> 00:20:45.600

Also, for those of you, if you can't attend but you want to

70236f28-c03d-4bb0-9d4b-b6226dfc76d8-1

Bio.

95f2c84d-e41c-47d1-a3be-53cba5eada54-0
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.070
There is an option if you would like to donate to a woman in

95f2c84d-e41c-47d1-a3be-53cba5eada54-1
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.990

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.111
help them heal their traumas and transforming that woman from

95f2c84d-e41c-47d1-a3be-53cba5eada54-3
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:05.132
being a passive member of the society to becoming an active

95f2c84d-e41c-47d1-a3be-53cba5eada54-4
00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:06.239
member of the society.

42b9aa51-2ae2-4b1a-9786-f2e691e8ef9b-0
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.633
Just Doctor Shafali, just imagine we have over hundreds of

42b9aa51-2ae2-4b1a-9786-f2e691e8ef9b-1
00:21:09.633 --> 00:21:12.589
millions of women around the world, especially women of

42b9aa51-2ae2-4b1a-9786-f2e691e8ef9b-2
00:21:12.589 --> 00:21:15.544
color, that they're not awakened, they haven't awakened

42b9aa51-2ae2-4b1a-9786-f2e691e8ef9b-3
00:21:15.544 --> 00:21:16.600
to their full power.

4f8e0e2c-372d-4278-b811-5ffe706081a0-0
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.040
Imagine if women would wake up to their power.

74f74351-f7cb-4ef2-9232-10103760e8eb-0
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.840
Wow, they can lift up this world.

cc0115fe-7f78-4550-91e7-f8e1fd51f41b-0
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.400
Wow.

2ec2eef5-db54-4e6d-b2a3-ca7ef494f5b3-0
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.000
This world will be a better place.

d15111af-6b4c-45e9-99a4-3ac0d36fc29b-0
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.000
Yeah.

bd275525-7b33-4eee-ad6a-0c94111bea90-0
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.200
Oh, absolutely.

850f0b1c-fc2c-4934-aaed-6490ae381834-0
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.680
And that's why, you know, most of my work is with parents

850f0b1c-fc2c-4934-aaed-6490ae381834-1
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.280
because when parents release their children, right, Then we

850f0b1c-fc2c-4934-aaed-6490ae381834-2
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.560
won't have as much trauma as we have.

cc937bfb-fb9c-4810-af95-1535ecbe06e9-0
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.157
So then we don't have adults who are walking around in so much

cc937bfb-fb9c-4810-af95-1535ecbe06e9-1
00:21:40.157 --> 00:21:40.440
pain.

89e69427-9bf8-4f97-baea-1ddb00f4c761-0
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.970
Imagine if your childhood was different or somebody else's

89e69427-9bf8-4f97-baea-1ddb00f4c761-1
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.000
childhood was different.

325a1110-ca64-4eec-b4e9-169370e3c53a-0
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.360
So we have to keep doing this work.

798e37cb-a45b-441b-b985-1c97e853a5b5-0
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.960
And that's the mission.

b71c5c49-ec09-4c97-80e8-a59e4ad82268-0
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.240
And that's the intention.

5bf7ca1e-7815-4037-9cb0-a9995e1c2d5d-0
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.034
I have a coaching institute for people who want to do this work

5bf7ca1e-7815-4037-9cb0-a9995e1c2d5d-1
00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:54.280
and be trained by me.

a0b3eb2e-165c-4ad0-951e-1912e3b00a26-0
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.162
I also have a coaching institute and that's starting in November

a0b3eb2e-165c-4ad0-951e-1912e3b00a26-1
00:21:58.162 --> 00:21:58.640
as well.

293d107e-9302-4bce-8a4f-8060a87d37ba-0
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.738
So many things, but, but, but for now, we want to focus on

293d107e-9302-4bce-8a4f-8060a87d37ba-1
00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:04.889
Evolve and if people want to come to Atlanta, Megan's going

293d107e-9302-4bce-8a4f-8060a87d37ba-2
00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:05.520
to be there.

66371f33-16e2-460b-b987-3c52350ea7cd-0
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.852
I'm going to be there and hundreds of other beautiful like

66371f33-16e2-460b-b987-3c52350ea7cd-1
00:22:09.852 --> 00:22:12.360
hearted humans are going to be there.

5fc33bdc-12af-4cf1-ae07-4d88953e3d60-0
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.360
So hopefully we're going to see you there guys.

c2f9a8b8-13d2-4e82-928b-14b10336949c-0
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.165
I can't wait to hold your hand
That evolved and cheer for you

c2f9a8b8-13d2-4e82-928b-14b10336949c-1
00:22:19.165 --> 00:22:21.560
while Doctor Shepali is waking you up.

40f6e1ed-fafa-493c-a0dc-f2dda441ad45-0
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.320
Basically.

79d755b3-0f64-4336-a67b-d6bea213b128-0
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.493
She's literally, she told me wake up, wake up and you

79d755b3-0f64-4336-a67b-d6bea213b128-1
00:22:25.493 --> 00:22:28.858
suddenly wake up from the nightmare of all of your trauma

79d755b3-0f64-4336-a67b-d6bea213b128-2
00:22:28.858 --> 00:22:31.760
and the world will become a better place for you.

5696499a-16a8-47a6-8308-2e83cc683b27-0
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.160
And and the the beautiful part is then you give it forward.

ba14fcef-c919-4177-b769-37ecc12cc703-0
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.760
Like I didn't ask Megan to do this.

131669cb-e57d-4694-b4bc-2cfe04b4bb5c-0
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.680
She wanted to do it.

b44b0062-ad75-430a-9d25-e5ca51bbf02c-0
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.160
I didn't ask her to come to eval.

348a0806-309d-49ad-8506-8eaa6e97b1e0-0
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.360
She wanted to come to eval.

979e87e0-0ac7-48b2-a43c-ecf1e10ba08c-0
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.880
Then it's out there.

bee00ecf-0469-4040-91f2-d65b03c86df8-0
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.808
Once you heal, that's why you have to heal your children,

bee00ecf-0469-4040-91f2-d65b03c86df8-1
00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:49.937
because they go out there and they do better in the world and

bee00ecf-0469-4040-91f2-d65b03c86df8-2
00:22:49.937 --> 00:22:51.200
the world begins to heal.

897a13b4-00d3-430f-8e9a-e86638e774b5-0
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.200
So, Megan, you've never done a live before.

1069e340-32e5-4d8b-94db-9070005d56ef-0
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.360
So can I just tell you some advice when you get off?

cc93a108-21b1-4224-b744-769d2b4a9cd0-0
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:56.480
Yeah.

e3dbce4c-3a48-4253-9f11-92182e26e280-0
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:56.880
Yeah.

3f9e8a6e-91d7-4dcc-a600-26aca56c49d2-0
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.120
Because I have deleted so many lives.

b58093fb-7d5e-4018-b7b3-d07f838461b2-0
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.406
So when you get off, it's going to give you an option to save it

b58093fb-7d5e-4018-b7b3-d07f838461b2-1
00:23:04.406 --> 00:23:05.920
and share this video.

983b8dc7-3da5-4b25-a939-7937a81a6de2-0
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.680
So you have to make sure you don't delete it.

c2203dd0-0163-4181-abcf-eee81133fa7c-0
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.680
I have deleted so many lives and then it's gone.

3ebd838e-25f7-42dd-8899-c42423f6076e-0
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.960
Like you cannot get it back.

bf651c4c-8e48-4c40-8498-ec86d75650f3-0
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.800
Oh, wow.

fd1da85a-5928-4cb4-868e-09eb55586048-0
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.720
OK Oh, no, no, no.

baa4294a-46be-403c-8597-c5268aa988fd-0
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720
We're getting this back.

e44cd49b-4242-47e5-af58-7f3208d05864-0
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.560
We're we're we're not.

feb31bf8-ba83-4e61-8ae1-ccc73a7976c2-0
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.280
Be careful when you put it off.

816b6e55-4595-4fb0-8f59-96fc94928530-0
00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.720
You can call somebody or call me and I'll help you.

dd6b92f5-d667-417b-a787-b6f31d10de2d-0
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.920
And you have to you have to share.

2b54cac7-62e5-4638-b9ec-43ce00f7e16d-0
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.840
I think the option is share this video.

a0a0090c-80b9-4c2c-b0fe-b6e90829e8d4-0
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:22.800
Yes.

e92d065a-8201-4aac-9ea6-0d6e05c584f8-0
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.480
And then you write a caption and then you do it.

90c108b5-8108-4691-95e0-41e9d1768781-0
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.520
So somebody else is coming to evolve.

2281e9e7-72c1-40fa-8f78-2c6a8a14edb0-0
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.440
They just said I'm coming.

29b5b472-170f-4462-ae1b-80bf7ab13103-0
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.160
So hopefully we'll see you there.

8a86f153-55c1-4f1c-b9b3-8e2b20bba4b0-0
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.160
It's in Atlanta in October.

a5b09006-32b9-4e0d-8f0e-09029209e9df-0
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.480
In 11 days.

78cb51f8-e234-476c-929d-7f8eef629e22-0
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.330
I cannot believe Megan and I
will see each other for the

78cb51f8-e234-476c-929d-7f8eef629e22-1
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.880
first time.

e2ae0ed5-6ecf-4c52-ab00-4dfdd6a64a90-0
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.480
We've never seen each other, but you would never know that.

0be21b0d-12d4-407b-8cd9-6dc1236585bc-0
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.286
And we're going to enjoy and celebrate the rebirthing of the

0be21b0d-12d4-407b-8cd9-6dc1236585bc-1
00:23:43.286 --> 00:23:44.400
authentic self.

80bd3e96-06b6-40e1-8031-80c5822a791b-0
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.840
I know I can't.

7cb0649d-bb55-4387-aed3-7e4d56631b27-0
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.360
The.

45bda641-cdc9-4288-a44a-d33422801cef-0
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.300
I'm glad that we're meeting now because the person you're

45bda641-cdc9-4288-a44a-d33422801cef-1
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.720
meeting now is my true self.

f8bb6237-839a-4902-9cda-743193c28a60-0
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.440
That's lovely.

961a8552-91b4-405d-9bde-1e5a0252aae6-0
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.920
So one last year was with a mask.

8af9635c-0621-4239-9821-d6f1c1a8e06a-0
00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.320
We're we're waiting.

8fd4ed9c-c0b4-4dbf-8c4f-693b9ac68bb1-0
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.200
And it's beautiful.

16d8001f-5ec3-4775-8b94-bf07cace8b5c-0
00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.880
Thank you all for joining us.

6d4e866e-ecfb-4fde-a545-b9fb7aa5f667-0
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.360
Thank you, Megan, so much.

765e6ff1-14ca-45eb-96b8-da5fbc12829c-0
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.280
Thank you so much.

f38a72aa-0cf6-44cc-9a13-cd420c512836-0
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.360
Can't wait to see you guys.

b6fe9d28-9c5f-4786-8dac-ed44bea2b627-0
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.240
See you at Evolve.

aece68ed-13f4-4001-b6ec-13c21e84df68-0
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.160
Can't wait.

74e0c32b-b80b-4a7b-88aa-9e5eb9dc0fcf-0
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.240
Thank you Megan.

31bd54dd-9194-4423-8b10-d02c77a04d49-0
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.480
Bye love.
