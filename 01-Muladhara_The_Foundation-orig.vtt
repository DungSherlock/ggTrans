00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.320
The foundation

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.559
Mula-aadhar means it is a foundation. We must understand, 

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.760
this is the foundation of our physical structure. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.640
If this foundation is not stabilized, one will not know 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.479
health, one will not know well-being, 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:42.840
one will not know a certain level of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.520
sense of being stable and complete 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.560
because these qualities are very essential 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.320
if you want a certain human being to make an effort to climb high. 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.439
One who is shaky on his legs, you can't make him climb a ladder. 

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.439
Only one who is firm on his legs, you can ask him to climb. 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.519
And he is willing to climb because there is a certain... 

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.400
there is a certain assurance in his legs. 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.079
Assurance is not just in your mind, assurance is in your body also. 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.239
This assurance is needed for one to walk through this planet 

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:26.280
efficiently and in a capable manner. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.200
If you're little unsteady on your legs, you wouldn't want to walk, you would want to sleep. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.519
Only when you feel steady on your legs, you want to walk. So

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:44.400
muladhara is the basis of this. An entire school of yoga, from

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.879
ways of doing things with the body to reach your 

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.719
ultimate nature, an entire school of yoga 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.040
evolved out of muladhara. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.120
One fundamental school, or one fundamental aspect of 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.599
muladhara, which came out, which a certain dimension of yoga, 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.240
which got referred to as kayakalpa. That means 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:19.360
kaya means body, kalpa means either establishing it, 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.000
to bring stability to it, it also means extending it. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.240
Kalpa essentially means a certain unit of time, which is very large. 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.120
In English, we can say it's like a eon, let's say a millennia. 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.199
So, you want to make the body last for a millennia or more, for a eon. 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:52.199
There have been many beings, who lasted out like this for hundreds of years

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:58.400
because they practiced what is called as kayakalpa, that is taking charge 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.560
of the fundamental ingredient in the system, which is earth.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.879
It is the earth which has given us substance - taking charge of the earth.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:17.000
Taking charge of the earth also gives you certain other capabilities - that is, 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
many things that the earth has to offer to us, many things that the soil has to offer to us, 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.680
to be able to grasp that, one dimension of bhuta shuddhi, 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.800
which is the earth, to be able to get that in to the system,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.759
to be able to get the juice of life into the system, you... 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.840
You are seeing solidified mercury, 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:57.800
this is kayakalpa. This is stabilizing a liquid

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.520
into a solid state. Because 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.039
mercury is referred to as rasa or the juice of this planet.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:14.479
This is the very juice. If you can solidify a liquid 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:21.399
which in its nature cannot be solid, then this is kayakalpa.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:26.519
This means many aspects of this body, which naturally 

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:30.959
deteriorate with time, you stabilize it in such a way 

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:35.759
that this deterioration is completely... not at a freeze,

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.639
but has slowed down to such a point that 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.879
it looks like you're ageless and timeless, that you have a kaya 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.240
which will last out a kalpa, that is, 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.600
a body which will last out an entire eon. 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.839
There have been many beings like that but these things take enormous amount of work 

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:03.199
of trying to make a body like a rock. 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.279
There are rocks in the mountain.   

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:12.319
In our perception, they seem to be forever. But

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:18.279
geologically, we know they were formed and they will be dismantled. 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:23.839
Because their timespan is a kalpa in our understanding, 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.759
because their lifespan is a kalpa 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:32.399
in our perception and experience of life… 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:36.920
If... You know... 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.399
A little bit smell of rain, not even rain, 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.839
just the smell of rain, a few drops fell somewhere, 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:49.600
suddenly these ants start flying with wings. 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.240
They're on just for about an hour-and-a-half or two and then they're gone.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.399
I'm sure in their experience, you are a kalpa. 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:04.439
Even if you live half a life, still you are a kalpa. If you live for fifty years, 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:09.240
those insects will think you lasting forever.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.120
So kayakalpa means that in... you look at something, let's say a rock

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.199
and you understand the composition of how a rock is made

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.319
what gives it that integrity that it will last for a period 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.360
which is much, much longer than the period that this body will last, 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:39.040
and try to make it like that. Or in other words, in some way you become a rock. 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.000
There are automobile companies, which are advertising that it's like a rock. 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.519
If you don't know this, the Chevy ad says, "It's like a rock." 

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:58.680
I don't know why you would like to drive a rock. Who would want to drive a rock 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.759
I hope the airplane companies don't take it up

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.879
If an airplane company says, "It's like a rock", 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.800
obviously it won't fly. And if it flies, it'll drop like a rock. 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.839
So kayakalpa if you do, you become like a rock. 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:25.800
What is the point? Well, in a society, if you're like a rock 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:35.839
you can earn a living, and you can act like a superman, 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:39.959
you can fascinate people. 

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:48.160
But a rock sometimes may not let you pass.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:56.040
So, the capability that comes, comes in many different ways.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.399
In the sense, one aspect of kayakalpa is 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.680
there is a certain dimension, 

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.839
which today… I wouldn't like to call this but you know,

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:19.519
we are speaking in English language, so we need to

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:22.160
cater to a certain logic, 

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.560
which people think is the only logic, which is completely wrong. 

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.639
There is something called as a pineal gland. 

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:38.039
The entire aspect of... 

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:44.600
various aspects of yoga or sadhana of yoga is to move it little down 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.000
south, it's called, moving it south. 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.879
This is the symbolism of Shiva turning south because

00:08:54.879 --> 00:09:00.440
his third eye moved south. What was up here 

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.919
came down between the two eyes. The moment it came here, 

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:08.600
he saw things that nobody had ever seen.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.159
Now, if this happens in a certain way, 

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:18.000
the secretions of the pineal, which in yoga is referred to as amrit 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.080
or amruta or amrutam in... probably in Sanskrit, 

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:29.159
this amrutam either can be taken 

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:32.200
into the system to strengthen the system 

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.159
and increase or extend the longevity of the system, 

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:40.759
or this amrita can be taken 

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:44.399
to create blissfulness in the system. Like a drug,

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:48.000
it can just blow you away. 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.240
Or you can use this amrita to enhance your perception, 

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.240
that you can become like thin air because

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.519
everything that is here passes through you. 

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:03.799
Right now, air passes only through your nostrils 

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:08.639
and you know if it doesn't pass, you're gone. 

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:13.919
If this air can pass through... right across you… 

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:17.120
Some of you might at some moment felt, 

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.600
when you're very carefree and joyful, you stood in the breeze, 

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.559
it feels like breeze is passing through you. 

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.679
Then you become hundred percent transparent. 

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:35.080
That is because you've used your amrita to bring sensitivity to the system.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.559
So these are three fundamental ways. One is 

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:42.320
to strengthen the body to make it like a rock, 

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.200
which will give a certain longevity to that person, 

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.879
which is considered superhuman by most people, 

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:56.440
or to bring such a level of drunkenness and blissfulness within you that 

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.000
you don't care how long you live, 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.559
or to make yourself like thin air that your perception is super hyped 

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:12.320
because there is absolutely no resistance the system. The same secretions 

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.720
of the pineal gland can be used in three different ways. 

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.879
And kayakalpa largely uses it to strengthen the body, 

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:27.519
to extend the longevity of the system. 

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:32.759
If you live here too long, others will want you to go. 

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:39.080
You may not want to go but the rest will want you to go.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.080
A rock, we bear with it because it doesn't talk and walk.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.159
But if you hang around for too long, people will wonder when 

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.360
But of course, some people will worship you because you look superhuman. 

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:05.200
Some people will be amazed by you because you don't die. 

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.639
Some people will be frustrated that you don't die 

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:15.000
This amrita or this secretion of the pineal gland 

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.559
will play the right kind of role in the system... When I say right, in my perception, 

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:26.840
only if it enhances your perception it is right, because 

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.600
if you do not enhance your perception, your life doesn't get enhanced in any way. 

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.519
It only gets enhanced in somebody else's eyes. 

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:40.120
If you become like a rock, 

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.600
your experience of life may not change,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.159
it is just other people think you are fantastic.

00:12:46.159 --> 00:12:52.200
Well, we could have made a statue out of you and you would have been a rock anyway.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.279
We didn't need a human being to become like a rock. 

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:00.120
If you have a rock for a brain, this will be the problem. 

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.960
You are always thinking which is a bigger rock than you, 

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.919
which is a smaller rock than you. Your entire life goes into this, 

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:12.519
as to which is superior, which is inferior, which is better, which is worse. 

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:17.360
Endlessly, you will be comparing yourself because this is the nature of a rock. 

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.919
This is the nature of physical reality. 

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:23.639
Once you identify yourself with physical reality, 

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:28.919
which is better, which is worse is a natural process of thought. 

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:32.919
Only if you transcend that, can you be free from this 

00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:37.399
as to which is better and which is worse.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:43.000
So, the schools which evolved out of the sadhana on muladhara… 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.919
Muladhara is very important for your existence. 

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:55.120
But a human being, only a human being knows – no other creature is aware of 

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.080
this, only human being knows – just existing is not good enough. 

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.440
None of the other creatures have realized this. Rocks have not realized this. 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.039
None of them, from amoeba to an elephant have not realized this 

00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:17.600
because it is not in their nature. They think their existence is good enough. 

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.159
But only a human being can know – not that everybody knows, 

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:29.200
can know – that existence is not good enough, something else needs to happen.
