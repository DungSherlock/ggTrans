1
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,720
I'm just

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,200
hesitating because I'm entering

3
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,760
dangerous territory.

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,520
People have been telling me, “Sadhguru,
this is for the exclusive.

5
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Say whatever you want to say.” But even if
it's exclusive, there are still people,

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,200
they are not extraterrestrials.

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,960
The same people so

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,800
they just have six dollars more...

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,360
So whatever I say right

10
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,160
now is not for practice,

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,280
not for any kind of pursuit.

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm just telling you simply a story.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,040
When I play a game,
any game, I'm very deceptive.

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,160
Deceptive means how you throw the ball,
how you throw the Frisbee,

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,320
what you do, it has to be deceptive,
otherwise you don't win a game.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,840
But when I speak, I’ve forgotten
how to be deceptive

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,200
long time ago,

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,560
so I'm struggling
how to tell you something and not tell you

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,800
everything (Laughter).

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,280
Not because it's a secret,

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,720
because

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,520
people may hurt themselves.

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,120
Okay, let's look at it this way.

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,400
Among the various

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,160
points of energy, because

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,320
dreams are very, very directly connected

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,760
to how your Pranamaya Kosha
reverberates...

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,560
How your energy functions,
that's how your thought,

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,520
that's how your emotion, that's
how your physical activity happens always.

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,560
But during waking states,
you may not allow it to happen

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,440
as it needs to happen.

32
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,080
You will do your own thing
according to what work you have,

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,080
what duties
you have, the social norms, everything.

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,280
You won't allow the body and mind

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,440
to work
according to your energetic intentions.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,440
But in sleep or in dream,

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,760
it is much, much more so.

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,080
So, having said that,

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,520
there are ways to hold
your energy in a certain way

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
with which

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,760
one can clearly determine
what will be the nature of our dreams.

42
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,280
And as I said,

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,040
this will very easily fall

44
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,240
into the last category of dreams
which is not really a dream,

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,040
or it will become a receptive process

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,680
for the third category of dreams
which are more

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,120
paranormal in nature that your system
is responding to some other event

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,640
that is happening elsewhere.
It could be a social thing.

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,080
Anything
which is a certain amount of energy,

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,560
a certain amount of power
shift is happening.

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,960
Suddenly one can become conscious of this.

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
It may not be in dream alone.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,240
It can happen in the daytime
also when you’re awake.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,200
But in dream states,
because other disturbances

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,800
are not there, as I said, lights are off,
you know, world has disappeared.

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,440
So there is much less disturbance,
one may see it much more clearly

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,920
during dream states.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,880
There are two different points in the body
through which one can project

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,000
one's life
energies outward when you're sleeping.

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Well,

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
if you use your Agna

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,200
and push it out

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
eighteen to 21 inches,

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,480
from there if you form an equilateral...

65
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,200
See, let's say 21 inches away if you form
an equilateral triangle like this, you're

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,680
lying down,
you will have an equilateral triangle

67
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,240
with sides,
all the three sides being approximately

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,840
twenty-four inches.

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,600
So if you're here,
this will be twelve inches here

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,160
and twelve inches above.

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,600
One way,
this could be done in one's meditativeness

72
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,120
which is a much more saner
way of doing things.

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Trying to do it in sleep states

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,280
need a certain level of

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,560
stability in the basic system.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,840
The energetic system must be stable,

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,960
otherwise playing with
this can take you somewhere else.

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,400
But one can do it in their wakeful states.

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,920
If you are able to push your
energies out 21 inches away,

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,400
then this triangle happens.

81
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,400
It is because of that triangle that -

82
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,360
this was very clear, in India,
I don't know if you’ve seen in the Spanda

83
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Hall images - when one is realized, one...

84
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,160
one kind of person has a halo...

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,880
halo here.

86
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,000
This is because he’s pushed his Agna out.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
When we see the halo,
we know this is Pragna.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,360
You must see the recognition

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,600
that happens when you go to certain

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
parts of India.

91
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,240
Unfortunately, rest of the world
has denied itself these things, and India

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,440
is working hard to deny itself
of everything (Laughs) right now.

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,280
In the sense,

94
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,600
like there are certain places

95
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
where

96
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,840
there is no other population
except the yogis and Sadhakas and mystics

97
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,040
and Aghoris and others living in certain
parts of India, still there. 

98
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
A few years ago, I...

99
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,640
I drive into this place

100
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,920
and I walk in.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,440
In one temple yard,

102
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,680
they're sitting.

103
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,800
In that there are a couple of...

104
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,680
two police constables and some village
officers and a few yogis are sitting.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,680
One man is in saffron clothes.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,840
They’re all drinking tea.

107
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
So I stand away and do namaskaram to him.

108
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,640
He looks at me, “Oh, you’ve come?

109
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Please come.”

110
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,280
I said okay, and he said, “Please, please,
sit down, sit down.

111
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,480
Tea, tea,” he said.

112
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,760
I said okay, And then he introduces me.

113
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,000
He says, “He's come from South India.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
He's doing a lot of work in the world.

115
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,240
He's spreading meditation.”
This, that, he’s telling them

116
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,920
everything about me

117
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,320
I’ve not uttered a word.

118
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,920
There are places like this
still where they maintain their own

119
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,320
atmosphere.

120
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,600
There used to be a lot of them
but unfortunately they’ve shrunk,

121
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,440
become very small.

122
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,120
Why I'm saying this is

123
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,840
because when you see the circle of Aura,

124
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,960
you know what is the type of dream

125
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,480
he is, because in that sphere of life,

126
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,000
your existence is seen as a dream.

127
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,360
See, look at it this way.

128
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,840
So many people were here

129
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
before us, and they’re gone.

130
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,920
Especially

131
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,840
somebody that you know was here
and now they died,

132
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,520
if you have lot of emotion towards them,

133
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,880
you won’t realize this,

134
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,520
but if you pay attention, just yesterday
they were walking here

135
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,600
- poof, gone.

136
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,400
After some time, you have to work hard to
imagine their face.

137
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,040
You have to look at their photograph,

138
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,960
but it's become hazier than the dream.

139
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,520
After some time you can talk yourself out

140
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,520
- actually they didn't exist,
we just thought them up.

141
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,720
Yes or no?

142
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,400
All the people,
generations of people who lived here,

143
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
did they actually exist in our experience?

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,760
No. It's like a dream.

145
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,720
We try to remind ourselves,
we'll try to look at their pictures

146
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,160
and say, “Yes, yes, they were here.”
But actually it's like a dream.

147
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,440
So even your existence here,
when it's seen as a dream,

148
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,760
this is a reality of that kind.

149
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,320
So if you look at a Aura
which is about twenty-four

150
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,400
inches in diameter,
that means it will cover Agna,

151
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,800
it will cover the Vishuddhi,
it will be just over the Sahasrar,

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,640
if he has this kind of plate...

153
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,760
You know, today is a full moon day.

154
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,560
So this is also something you must learn.

155
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,720
When you go and see the moon, don't
see it as a flat plate, white plate.

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,880
It’s a

157
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
circle.

158
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,640
You must see that.

159
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,880
It is visible if you pay enough attention,
but most people think it's a plate.

160
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
No, it's like a ball.

161
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,040
You have to see that
every time you see the moon because

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
seeing the moon in the right perspective

163
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,280
is very important for dreams.

164
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,920
Dreams and moon are very connected.

165
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,080
Moon always makes you little
dreamy (Laughs).

166
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,240
Little crazy
also because dreams are crazy.

167
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,320
You call something crazy

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,840
when something doesn't have logical steps.

169
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,080
One, two, twelve, fifteen, fifteen, three,
three, thirty-two.

170
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,160
If somebody reads number system like this,
you will say, “Oh, you're crazy.”

171
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,920
That's what dream is.

172
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,240
This problem of engineering
something is of the physical world.

173
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,440
You have to put one brick
on top of another.

174
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,480
In the dream, you can put the top
brick first and then put the second one.

175
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,800
Like this you can build the wall.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,520
This is a dream.

177
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,080
So this is why, you know,

178
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,240
we are not letting you do Shirshasan
because,

179
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,520
things to do sensibly.

180
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:01,920
because, things to do sensibly.

181
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,440
If you can push your life energies

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,520
21 inches away

183
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,480
and...

184
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,640
I'm just saying
if you can hold it like that

185
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,360
just for two fortnights,

186
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
that's for one cycle of the moon,

187
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,360
you will get a moon around your head,
a halo, always,

188
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,880
which is just approximately twenty-four
inches in diameter.

189
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,960
It covers your face and this much.

190
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,640
You have seen sages and say...

191
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,920
If the paintings are coming
from elsewhere, it doesn't mean anything.

192
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,560
It may be just artists this thing.

193
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,560
But if it comes from India and certain

194
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,320
other cultures
which are conscious about this -

195
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,320
ancient painters, not today's painters -
then when they put the halo,

196
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,880
they're telling you who this man is,
what are his capabilities, what are his

197
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,600
inner qualifications.

198
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
Or if you push

199
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
your life energies

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,880
from your Anahata,
then it will go up to thirty-three

201
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,840
inches, anywhere
between thirty to thirty-three inches.

202
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,080
If that happens,

203
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,120
the base of the triangle will become
approximately thirty-nine inches.

204
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,800
That is, the sides of the triangle

205
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,680
will be thirty-nine inches
for a equilateral triangle.

206
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,280
The significance of this is
this will cover all the seven

207
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,320
major chakras - this triangle.

208
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,120
Now you have seen some yogis have a halo.

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,600
If they're sitting here,
they have a halo like this.

210
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,040
Have you noticed this?

211
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,960
No? You've not seeing such paintings?

212
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,680
Nothing here?

213
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,000
What did they give to Adiyogi (Laughs)?

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
No halo. That's good.

215
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,360
They didn't see it.

216
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,200
So you will see some yogis,
a halo is going like this.

217
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,960
This is a thirty-nine-inch diameter.

218
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,680
Doesn’t matter what’s your height,

219
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,000
this is a thirty-nine-inch diameter

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,480
halo.

221
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,640
That means it covers all the aspects. 

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,200
If you’re able to do both in your sleep,
that you're able

223
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,280
to push your Agna out 21 inches and this,

224
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,920
then these two triangles

225
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,640
will intersect and the intersection

226
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,400
will cover the Vishuddhi
in a powerful way.

227
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,720
Now, when such a thing happens,

228
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,640
normally in India we say

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,280
he is an incarnation of Shiva

230
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,200
because

231
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,080
the energy...

232
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
What a halo is, is,

233
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,280
is a nurturing bubble
that you carry with yourself.

234
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,880
Either just your head is being nurtured

235
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,360
or your whole thing is being nurtured
and particular focus on Vishuddhi.

236
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,040
If everything is being nurtured
and particular focus on Vishuddhi,

237
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,320
then we say, “You’re

238
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:18,000
just like him.”

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Now, if...

240
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,240
if you manage to push this approximately,
let's say,

241
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,440
not 21 inches, you pushed it nine inches.

242
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,120
Then what happens to you is,

243
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,520
you will have relief from constant
unnecessary mental activity.

244
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
This is what
a whole lot of people in the world

245
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,560
are saying are the benefits of meditation,

246
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,640
that their mental activity has come down,
they’re feeling little more peaceful

247
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,840
and they're little better human beings
because

248
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,880
in their daytime,

249
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,800
knowingly
or unknowingly, little has been pushed.

250
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,040
May not be happening in sleep,

251
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,200
but if it happens in sleep, you will find

252
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,920
complete relief from this unnecessary

253
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,120
mental activity that's happening.

254
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
If you manage to push this,

255
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
let's say, twelve inches,

256
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,280
very easily you access the minds

257
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,280
of...

258
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,320
minds

259
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,360
and intentions of all the people
who are connected with you.

260
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,640
Particularly if they’re blood related,

261
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,760
you can very easily know their intent
and their minds,

262
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,640
effortlessly, without trying to read their
minds, simply like that.

263
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,920
If you push this out

264
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,160
fifteen inches, you will know

265
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,040
of significant events anywhere
that's happening.

266
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,720
Major shifts that happened in this planet
or in this planetary system,

267
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,440
you will know.

268
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,280
It is from this

269
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,560
that you will see

270
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,920
many yogis and sages and seers predicted

271
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:41,640
that at this time, a comet will happen,

272
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,160
a major comet will happen which can cause
this kind of influence upon the planet.

273
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,120
Like this, they have said in the past
and it's happened exactly at those times

274
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,000
because they saw it coming,
not with a telescope or something,

275
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,520
in their energies they saw it's coming.

276
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,560
If you push this eighteen inches,

277
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,800
all that's worth knowing you can access.

278
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,040
Takes a little...

279
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,600
like going to a library
and reading up a bit,

280
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,440
but you have access
to all that’s worth knowing.

281
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,800
If you

282
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,360
push it full 21 inches and it stays there,

283
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,200
then your consciousness becomes cosmic

284
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,640
and can facilitate liberation or

285
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,680
what is now generally known

286
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,640
as Mahasamadhi or

287
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,920
Mahaparinirvana.

288
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,080
That means one can leave consciously.

289
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,760
If you can hold it up at 21 inches

290
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,920
away from your Agna,

291
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,280
this will open up slowly.

292
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,520
As it opens up, life

293
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
and leaving the body becomes an entirely

294
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,160
conscious process.
