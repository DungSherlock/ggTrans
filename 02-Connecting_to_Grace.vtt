00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.358
Namaskaram Sadhguru I was wondering how the practice of

1d6f0287-23b6-426a-b367-b8f541c851d7-1
00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:23.365
touching a guru's or elder's feet to get their blessing came

1d6f0287-23b6-426a-b367-b8f541c851d7-2
00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:23.760
about.

a3e48cbd-78ff-4586-b528-2f132cc18146-0
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.661
Sadhguru, there is a whole technology about how to hold the

a3e48cbd-78ff-4586-b528-2f132cc18146-1
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:32.120
feet.

ad2efd79-8617-4c41-b36e-260a590f3aff-0
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
I am not just about to explain that.

638dc6f9-e8d8-4846-b75c-bb170668414d-0
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240
Then I know what happens to my walking.

9d17be22-289b-4aad-b91e-4773d0a0cfce-0
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600
Already people are taking lot of pleasure and pulling my leg.

482ed1b0-9401-4e9d-a637-ff2544e8ea44-0
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:09.381
Now if I tell them this is the way to touch the guru's feet to

482ed1b0-9401-4e9d-a637-ff2544e8ea44-1
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:15.620
receive the maximum of this is today.

5e5e0a1d-9625-4171-95a5-ca879cc20a19-0
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.713
The neurosciences will also prove this to you, that your

5e5e0a1d-9625-4171-95a5-ca879cc20a19-1
00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:32.304
hands, your palm and your feet have maximum amount of

5e5e0a1d-9625-4171-95a5-ca879cc20a19-2
00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:38.490
neurological activity if you are sensitive.

b2af83c0-54a4-43a6-b57e-b028097c1d21-0
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.074
If you touch anything with your hands, you will limitedly know

b2af83c0-54a4-43a6-b57e-b028097c1d21-1
00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.050
what it is.

d9f7888f-1f62-49c9-9840-d8ae0ea3dd10-0
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.496
If you touch it with your shoulder, you will not know what

d9f7888f-1f62-49c9-9840-d8ae0ea3dd10-1
00:01:51.496 --> 00:01:51.770
it is.

77a9bee7-19ab-43b1-b2c3-8b914a8a0328-0
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.850
If you touch it with your back, you will not know what it is.

7ca857c5-825b-4800-846a-cb46867905db-0
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.644
If you touch it with the back of your head, you will not know

7ca857c5-825b-4800-846a-cb46867905db-1
00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:00.349
what it is, but you touch it with your hand immediately you

7ca857c5-825b-4800-846a-cb46867905db-2
00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.829
will know what it is, not just in terms of feeling and

7ca857c5-825b-4800-846a-cb46867905db-3
00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:03.280
sensation.

54710c11-dc84-4c7d-8df8-55f2ababd658-0
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.320
Much deeper perception happens with your hands.

4672ee54-9ce6-417a-866e-404f325d5587-0
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.360
So when it comes to receiving, hands are powerful instruments.

7f9f2ff9-3a3a-4f7e-a94c-a8a6b8355ff4-0
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.855
But if you want to give you energies to something, feet are

7f9f2ff9-3a3a-4f7e-a94c-a8a6b8355ff4-1
00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:21.960
very powerful instruments.

b0bb3159-29e4-4647-b620-a872d90ba7bb-0
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.313
There is a certain way to use your hands and feet with your

b0bb3159-29e4-4647-b620-a872d90ba7bb-1
00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:30.870
hands.

e3e7fc2b-043e-4ff0-a013-ffad8b6832d6-0
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
We are teaching you mudras.

b5cd53ef-e990-44d9-aa97-f9b80737403f-0
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.710
These are certain ways of using your hands for your benefit.

af1c92b5-2bc3-47f2-b961-df8cc695811c-0
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.870
How many mudras are you doing?

27472ee0-d97c-4652-9014-552f38079814-0
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.870
6,7,4,5,6, I think 6 or 7 mudras.

33564977-35dd-4e42-96e6-d229a00f7d23-0
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.110
Pub.

918f9797-2c6f-4b72-afc1-b00c6a94928c-0
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.910
So this is the technology of using the hand.

2563515a-1935-4a71-a9f9-914985c40b03-0
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.870
There are dozens of mudras used for different purposes.

68f107fe-e3bd-429d-9f16-261e26fb2f9b-0
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.544
With some you can restrain your energies, With some you can

68f107fe-e3bd-429d-9f16-261e26fb2f9b-1
00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:13.430
dissipate your energies.

4b45d546-1a3e-4655-8349-c53cb41da06f-0
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.670
Feet are of a different kind.

61e20c17-2c54-43c7-af88-0a5c05639c28-0
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.910
There are people.

fcea8e4f-3652-4128-872d-675b555e0bea-0
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.830
We did this at one time.

c1ab3884-99ab-472c-a8b2-d572fafba496-0
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.910
We gave it up because it's such an elaborate process.

c92936de-1137-4335-9d27-e1848b6ca05d-0
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.840
We were teaching people how to, you know, manipulate one's feet

c92936de-1137-4335-9d27-e1848b6ca05d-1
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.390
to different states of experience.

7759fbb3-19ab-47ab-826c-1360266b2193-0
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.350
Want to relax somebody?

eb36f1ef-6376-4a6d-9e7b-eea8a936cd58-0
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.310
Where to press.

38ec041e-41ad-4a9b-ae2d-fcece9e5181e-0
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.910
If you want to make somebody blissful, where to press?

6b1266f4-70ff-4249-9588-ff4c3f6e769b-0
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.295
If you want to make somebody loving where to press

6b1266f4-70ff-4249-9588-ff4c3f6e769b-1
00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:57.110
everything, all the seven different chakras are in your

6b1266f4-70ff-4249-9588-ff4c3f6e769b-2
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.540
feet.

a27a335e-c4e6-4fbc-822c-8e68b11c1d34-0
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.844
If you know how to handle this, you can do many things with the

a27a335e-c4e6-4fbc-822c-8e68b11c1d34-1
00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:12.102
whole system just by operating the feet about touching or

a27a335e-c4e6-4fbc-822c-8e68b11c1d34-2
00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:17.820
holding feet which are of a certain level of energy.

4bf56e17-9122-4654-9e18-bfe3376e8ff9-0
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.180
First of all, people should have something to give.

4b53e5dd-7f85-4c01-9cd4-7f1809ddc731-0
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.476
If you go and ask for a loan for somebody who is a Papa, that's

4b53e5dd-7f85-4c01-9cd4-7f1809ddc731-1
00:04:29.476 --> 00:04:30.370
no good.

8f14a3eb-c783-4f9e-9c2f-a73f4d174987-0
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.496
If you want to ask for a loan, you must ask from somebody who

8f14a3eb-c783-4f9e-9c2f-a73f4d174987-1
00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:37.450
has it, yes?

fb7f8499-209c-4ae5-8ced-dac202d6acbe-0
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.611
So you don't go and hold somebody's feet when he himself

fb7f8499-209c-4ae5-8ced-dac202d6acbe-1
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:44.530
is bankrupt.

8e4becfb-243f-43ae-90ef-c97b9b1339d5-0
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.130
If he's bursting with energies and he's willing to share.

c8aa0564-9ad6-4942-8ffa-d5c89901a0fb-0
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.000
Now there is a certain way to connect.

564c358f-93db-487d-8cd2-14a32454892f-0
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.120
It is like a plug point.

0ddf40e8-aa68-44c8-8b18-0ebb277e78da-0
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.480
There's a certain way to connect.

cb17b278-1649-47f4-aa12-e1cd58342b9c-0
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.360
Now, plug points come in different ways.

380260f5-7b10-4143-94e8-4591107f89da-0
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.240
It's a big battle if you travel internationally.

d9355592-2258-45d7-9f3b-967400033201-0
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.921
My my hand baggage has a multi plug which goes into

d9355592-2258-45d7-9f3b-967400033201-1
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:23.781
international fittings everywhere and I have about 7 or

d9355592-2258-45d7-9f3b-967400033201-2
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.560
8 chargers in it.

87d2b733-c02e-40ba-a85e-212338a95e9f-0
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.295
Every time it goes through the security, they get so suspicious

87d2b733-c02e-40ba-a85e-212338a95e9f-1
00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:39.410
that I must be carrying a bomb because so many wires and so

87d2b733-c02e-40ba-a85e-212338a95e9f-2
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.440
many things because now this is a big corn job everywhere.

cc44e55f-9d95-4b7f-9d38-5e6f162cbfd1-0
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.150
If you buy this phone today, it's got one kind of charger.

8721381c-9c5e-4647-9039-268ac9862abd-0
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.599
After two years you had to buy an attachment for that something

8721381c-9c5e-4647-9039-268ac9862abd-1
00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.630
that's got another kind of charger.

699be819-2b9e-4c52-b041-89b8c19729cd-0
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.871
You you buy another company, something else, you have another

699be819-2b9e-4c52-b041-89b8c19729cd-1
00:06:01.871 --> 00:06:02.790
kind of charger.

849ac408-dfc7-41f3-bcda-a289ea9e513c-0
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.635
So ultimately I am carrying more than half a dozen chargers and a

849ac408-dfc7-41f3-bcda-a289ea9e513c-1
00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:13.950
multi pin and all electrical connections like I'm some kind

849ac408-dfc7-41f3-bcda-a289ea9e513c-2
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.050
of an electrician or a bomb maker.

5c7f1d92-eea6-4be1-b61b-b5ddc3e1e8aa-0
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.730
I don't wear my turban otherwise for sure.

695a9411-a2f0-446a-a3f8-2182786ba856-0
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.684
So if you want to connect to that particular plug point, you

695a9411-a2f0-446a-a3f8-2182786ba856-1
00:06:34.684 --> 00:06:36.410
need a particular kind of plug.

2e45b320-371d-44e0-9da6-86b4b3573d16-0
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.690
You go to Europe, it's one way UK, another way United States.

b9df12be-7515-4230-9425-f03a2be3339e-0
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.050
Of course they're different.

c0ffd073-9392-40bc-9885-a9c57ae36b24-0
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.830
II another way or the rest of the world another way.

455ef6e1-3d33-4ffb-8934-9538120fa258-0
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.390
Wherever you go, it's a *******
different plug point.

d853c873-cc8c-4271-9d34-448e8890d6c5-0
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.350
And except in Asia, I don't know why this is.

f6ad52d0-e102-42ec-8ab5-516875938662-0
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.939
Except in Asia, if you want to plug your cell phone, you have

f6ad52d0-e102-42ec-8ab5-516875938662-1
00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:05.703
to crawl under a table or a cot or something in American hotels,

f6ad52d0-e102-42ec-8ab5-516875938662-2
00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:06.630
wherever you go.

2ca90a7b-c431-4a01-b9d3-02c9bc355ed5-0
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.330
Have you seen this in India?

a46e8d54-314c-40e4-bb64-f3bbdb570400-0
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.930
Always.

77103e86-bcac-48d1-a22d-72b6336f70b7-0
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.370
It's next to your bed.

b6a9a9f2-db7f-44eb-9aff-8ce1bd45cf21-0
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.090
Light switch is next to your bed.

b305c3a1-6746-49ac-9741-fdf9f55b4a4e-0
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.930
That's the only way.

75a8e692-7c1c-4576-984b-0d2c43edeb26-0
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.054
Otherwise people won't stay in that hotel in United States for

75a8e692-7c1c-4576-984b-0d2c43edeb26-1
00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:19.650
some reason.

f63877c6-41a7-4538-b2b4-2f4441275764-0
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.869
I'm still trying to understand why always the light switch is

f63877c6-41a7-4538-b2b4-2f4441275764-1
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:24.890
somewhere else.

23791d19-65d6-493b-a919-11b917086b4e-0
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.250
You have to switch it off and come and sleep.

527eaf18-9dc6-4cae-a4f1-4cffa1b8820b-0
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.346
And the plug point is always under the you have to crawl and

527eaf18-9dc6-4cae-a4f1-4cffa1b8820b-1
00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:36.690
and you don't know which plug is going to go in there.

498c96b6-095e-4de3-ae6c-9ac0aa9e7d5c-0
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.610
It's a struggle.

db2f8b0e-378c-4103-9d44-410f3314d5ef-0
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.400
So this holding of somebody's feet is just like this.

225378bc-2601-4e6a-9dc2-448e374ca0fe-0
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:58.751
If someone is a, let's say you have the tradition or habit of

225378bc-2601-4e6a-9dc2-448e374ca0fe-1
00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:03.880
touching the feet of your elders.

8bffe934-a540-45fa-964c-49bc3dde8161-0
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.240
HM in many homes it is still there, right?

aa88bd17-59af-4cad-8f51-1874de9643b2-0
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.120
Probably in South India, it's gone.

ca88757f-45dd-4d58-aaa1-d815f92d1aee-0
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.746
In North India, it's still very much there because of the Vedic

ca88757f-45dd-4d58-aaa1-d815f92d1aee-1
00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:14.200
culture.

f25532ab-9c5b-43a4-8ff0-1d83fa0c4f02-0
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.095
So when they see a father, a mother, uncle, anybody elder to

f25532ab-9c5b-43a4-8ff0-1d83fa0c4f02-1
00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:21.000
them, they will first thing is touch their feet.

c2dbef08-4a70-4f0a-bc8a-42e00de7a999-0
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.840
So that is only for respect.

afeebce0-c258-4361-a4db-59908ba0d8eb-0
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.060
You don't want to receive their energy, that is to offer you

afeebce0-c258-4361-a4db-59908ba0d8eb-1
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.760
respects to them.

b5e48180-0b63-4031-a0f9-203e953af4bd-0
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.400
So that's one way of doing it.

206caa95-0083-46ae-8dd5-a5e4c3ec4cdc-0
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.960
You want to receive their energy, your uncle's energy.

54c50f19-bdd1-4ac1-982e-9eb3aa6fe8d1-0
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:48.780
You see a deity, another way of doing it.

05b7223f-56ae-40ec-9e69-d2d4edb8e5c2-0
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.834
If you do Namaskar or frustration to a powerful being,

05b7223f-56ae-40ec-9e69-d2d4edb8e5c2-1
00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:04.567
not spiritually evolved, but powerful in his own way, there

05b7223f-56ae-40ec-9e69-d2d4edb8e5c2-2
00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:06.860
is another way of doing.

097fc059-c505-46f6-a674-c14d53485e3a-0
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.800
If you bow down to your guru, there's another way of doing.

c1b3a869-4d6e-4d0f-958c-aec85c9cfcdd-0
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.360
As I said, I don't want to go into these technologies.

a378c76d-1e2e-4f72-800d-052801ae39f3-0
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.707
I can tell you the other three, but I don't want to tell you how

a378c76d-1e2e-4f72-800d-052801ae39f3-1
00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:24.840
to bow down to a guru.

c52f14f3-5e62-41b9-af33-f86711470942-0
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.981
Whichever way you feel, you do it that way because I don't want

c52f14f3-5e62-41b9-af33-f86711470942-1
00:09:29.981 --> 00:09:32.560
my legs pulled and held all the time.

bac5fa84-0595-4d22-a02a-fbae7827ceb2-0
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:44.650
HM once a day, so a few 100
people once a day.

a95ded0f-702e-458f-a05e-cf9e6867762e-0
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.690
Better to leave my feet and walk wooden legs.

c3b9cf87-ada0-42dc-840a-ffebf22b6b74-0
00:09:53.490 --> 00:10:01.311
So we are preparing Rasapada solidified mercury feet, which

c3b9cf87-ada0-42dc-840a-ffebf22b6b74-1
00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:08.350
are consecrated and energized by me in a certain way.

886ceb6c-bc4e-429b-8440-6daf54394627-0
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.724
I can give it to you, you can do it every day, 12 times a day you

886ceb6c-bc4e-429b-8440-6daf54394627-1
00:10:12.724 --> 00:10:13.830
can do no problem.

7eccf042-f6b1-4d95-b2d6-2d65eae06fcd-0
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.110
Not my feet.

f4320dde-9afe-4e46-a542-6d86f495583c-0
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.164
So the receptivity where it is in your hand and the giving

f4320dde-9afe-4e46-a542-6d86f495583c-1
00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:29.030
nature of the feet where it is.

50d195a0-4010-4535-a16b-c1a499e8aecc-0
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.861
If these two things are connected, what you cannot

50d195a0-4010-4535-a16b-c1a499e8aecc-1
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:36.898
achieve in years and years of sadhana, you may achieve in a

50d195a0-4010-4535-a16b-c1a499e8aecc-2
00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:37.369
moment.

e94989ec-7ba0-436d-a21c-164b9d51b097-0
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.055
It is with that hope everybody is diving and diving and diving

e94989ec-7ba0-436d-a21c-164b9d51b097-1
00:10:49.055 --> 00:10:52.330
all the time that they may somewhere connect.

1c790d5a-247d-4b44-9410-9b7aaccf3d6b-0
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.770
So it is.

7546513d-d70d-4778-925a-5381967de09c-0
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.761
People probably think probably this part of the world, people

7546513d-d70d-4778-925a-5381967de09c-1
00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:11.430
understand that as a kind of subjugation or slavery, that

7546513d-d70d-4778-925a-5381967de09c-2
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.650
somebody is falling at somebody's feet.

eb1a816c-1b30-4264-b006-e6e2acd1d74a-0
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.427
In the yogic tradition, we never thought feet was less than the

eb1a816c-1b30-4264-b006-e6e2acd1d74a-1
00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:21.770
hands.

53a724f5-edcf-43fd-bed8-34b1e7383e56-0
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.490
It was never seen that way that one part of the body is less

53a724f5-edcf-43fd-bed8-34b1e7383e56-1
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.130
than the other.

cc286f50-cece-4801-989f-64a81be0ccdc-0
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.534
So wherever it works, that's how you do it, because it's down

cc286f50-cece-4801-989f-64a81be0ccdc-1
00:11:35.534 --> 00:11:36.050
there.

e1790fcb-aeb7-4386-bdef-f2d2a95c0710-0
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.130
You have to go down.

7fec3b41-f613-48c6-b69c-66808714333b-0
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:43.190
There is no other way unless you catch him when he is doing

7fec3b41-f613-48c6-b69c-66808714333b-1
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.030
headstand.

47af76d0-5f60-4cd1-b666-c2188bfb6d8d-0
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.721
But then on top of that you have to go on headstand to get into

47af76d0-5f60-4cd1-b666-c2188bfb6d8d-1
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:53.790
right position, which is a very acrobatic thing to do.

3da3ff4f-51dd-4d7d-876c-f965e2259557-0
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.516
So it's best to catch him when he is standing or walking so

3da3ff4f-51dd-4d7d-876c-f965e2259557-1
00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:00.510
people dies.

68955b31-222a-4d2f-a221-0a4ab1c1b0d3-0
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.350
There are certain traditions in the country.

e9cdbc76-af33-401c-873d-b25035451661-0
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.692
When they come to me, I'm amazed that these things have been

e9cdbc76-af33-401c-873d-b25035451661-1
00:12:07.692 --> 00:12:09.720
taught to them from their childhood.

80db9951-9712-4d36-b28d-e4eb2155e1b2-0
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.120
They know exactly how to do it.

cc39ecb2-586b-43f6-8921-4d750d3f074a-0
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.360
But most other people are just doing it by their emotion.

8d03b118-775a-419e-84f8-29048be92294-0
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.760
Sometimes they may get it right.

1b7ec8e1-a9b6-4a06-967b-a66cf4a85d02-0
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.440
So some people, so that they don't make the mistake, they

1b7ec8e1-a9b6-4a06-967b-a66cf4a85d02-1
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.220
just touch all the parts like this, like this, like this, like

1b7ec8e1-a9b6-4a06-967b-a66cf4a85d02-2
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:28.520
this.

451fb7d7-9eba-4ea2-8b0d-4499fcfe8b72-0
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.160
Have you seen this?

ee09b32d-61b5-4c10-a5a3-176495ce1518-0
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.016
It's only Indian people because they know they have missed the

ee09b32d-61b5-4c10-a5a3-176495ce1518-1
00:12:35.016 --> 00:12:38.000
technology, so they want to somehow connect.

7efe4523-7050-48fe-899d-6a494f42df00-0
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.560
They'll hold the bottom like this, like that.

7fb2333f-7087-4f97-9862-6d9d01ff8169-0
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.320
It doesn't matter.

d362bf51-544b-4bf1-b6f9-24bff1914ff9-0
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.000
The guru falls and breaks his head.

ce14d564-6a0b-4547-a944-b8a9f7494297-0
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.847
They'll put their hands under his feet and wherever it is,

ce14d564-6a0b-4547-a944-b8a9f7494297-1
00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:53.680
they want to get it.

b74d18a5-d972-43dc-80a9-73a290b958ad-0
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:03.841
It's a treasure hunt, so, so that is the reason why whenever

b74d18a5-d972-43dc-80a9-73a290b958ad-1
00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:12.270
the crowds increased, the gurus always created an energy form.

8514903e-99e8-4bba-97d8-0f9159daf622-0
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.670
They said go bow down to that to save their own feet.

3a34cd60-6809-4e50-a421-a9bdd54e85ac-0
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.091
So we can create an energy form to which you can bow down and

3a34cd60-6809-4e50-a421-a9bdd54e85ac-1
00:13:26.091 --> 00:13:27.710
receive which is better.

cf1ddc73-901b-488f-a0f0-4405340f1033-0
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.780
These are walking feet.

66dd9c36-c50e-4c67-b5bc-8961ba76f748-0
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.420
The energy forms cannot walk away from you.

85c11dab-913e-4319-b607-7945fc266d9c-0
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.220
You can bow down as many times as you want per day.

9e4e3449-a51f-4bdd-82c0-477e760113db-0
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.100
They cannot resist and it's OK.

bcb0e51b-0ad7-420b-8c85-c2ad3f3c5f3d-0
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:05.340
So there is a whole technology of doing that, Sashtang.

c4269c20-6520-4de4-bdb6-acd4f00338c8-0
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:15.778
You're doing Sashtang as one of the postures when you're doing

c4269c20-6520-4de4-bdb6-acd4f00338c8-1
00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.140
Surinamaskar.

205525ce-4c81-4792-8c83-19c1e9761551-0
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.925
Sashtang means it's eight points in the body at touching the

205525ce-4c81-4792-8c83-19c1e9761551-1
00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:24.380
floor.

c515f415-dd32-46d8-b5da-870b508a7247-0
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.060
That's the first step of preparation before 1 bows down.

1ba0be81-13b5-4130-a90e-f2901f392b13-0
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.820
The next we'll leave it.
