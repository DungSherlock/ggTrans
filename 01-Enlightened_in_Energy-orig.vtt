00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.002


00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.720
When you

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.823
look at your life,

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.061
the way you live it,

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.897
many times

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.867
you would have noticed

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:38.772
that you're ruled by compulsive emotions.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.879
Today, you really want to be peaceful.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.448
Today it happens to be your wife's birthday

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.550
or husband's something,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.586
you really want to make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:57.023
That's the day just the anger rules you,

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.759
just comes out for no reason.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:07.834
It happened once,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.471
one morning, early in the morning,

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.740
Shankaran Pillai

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.610
was walking in the neighborhood on the street,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.813
loudly cursing,

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.548
Let devil take over your life!

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.917
Let snakes infest your belly!

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.886
Let the worms come out of your mouth!

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.889
Like this he went about cursing.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:34.794
One of his neighbors saw
this man cursing and going.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.763
He stopped him and asked,

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.965
Who are you cursing?

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:43.536
Who are you cursing
early in the morning like this?

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.072
He said, It doesn't matter whom,

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:49.175
somebody will come by.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.814
Sooner or later,
somebody is bound to come by,

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:57.784
so I'm cursing right now.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.919
It is not about anybody.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.855
It is not about anything.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.090
It is a compulsive emotion

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.625
which is coming out.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.327
Usually, whoever is around you

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.629
becomes the victim.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.930
But actually,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.932
it doesn't need anybody.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:16.636
You can get angry with trees.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.977
So,

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.748
these things people try to control
for their whole lifetimes

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.618
and nothing changes.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.491
The mechanics of the mind,

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.694
the way the mind functions,

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.431
is just the way

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:48.701
the karmic substance is,

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:52.005
because mind is just an accumulation.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.907
What kind of accumulation you have,

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:57.010
that's how it functions.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.014
If one has to go beyond the limitations

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.383
or beyond the compulsiveness

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.218
that a certain type of accumulation

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.554
creates within us,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.056
either

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.392
one has to raise into

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.194
a different level of awareness,

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.095
consciousness

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.765
with which he can become free.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.633
Or another way is

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:24.204
he has to transform his energies.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:30.009
Raising to higher levels of consciousness

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.881
generally is very deceptive.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:38.451
Everybody believes
they are very high consciousness.

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:41.321
If you put them to test,

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.122
then they'll fail miserably

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.958
because

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.727
the nature of the mind is such,

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.464
it can deceive you till the end.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:55.668
This is not a simple instrument.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:04:00.373
This is a very, very complex instrument.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.675
You may think you know it,

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:05.945
but you will see after 25 years you'll realize

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:09.182
that you've been tricking yourself all the way,

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.652
because it's a very, very complex instrument.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.454
Most people are using

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.823
just a miniscule of their mind,

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.192
so they think it is simple,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:23.062
otherwise it's a very complex instrument.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.364
So raising

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.699
the levels of consciousness

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.435
is not out of question,

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.304
but still it's very tricky

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:34.140
and can be very deceptive.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.511
People

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.015
believe they have changed,

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.317
many, many times.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.085
Simply because their situations have

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.288
become a little more conducive,

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.489
they have changed.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.157
If situations become extreme,

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:54.394
again they're back to the same place.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.528
Yes, have you noticed this

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.196
again and again?

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.573
Somebody is working in a certain situation

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:08.474
and they don't like it

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.709
and they're constantly angry

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:10.943
and disturbed.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.146
They went to a new work situation and they say,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.481
Oh, now I'm fine.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.517
Everything is okay with me.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.052
It is not so.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.187
Everything is not okay with you.

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:23.256
Right now the weather is good,

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.358
so you seem to be okay.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.427
Once again the weather turns bad,

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.697
which invariably it will today or tomorrow,

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.933
again you will go through the same thing.

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.669
When you talk about consciousness,

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.272
you're looking at life in such a way

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:42.608
that you're not subject to the processes of life,

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:45.778
that the external situations
don't decide who you are.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:48.948
That's what it means to
become conscious.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.151
That is also a possibility,

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.186
but

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.221
it can be a great deception game

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.889
most of the time.

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.459
Transforming your energies

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.595
is a more certain and solid way

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:05.064
because here you can't fool yourself,

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:07.500
here you can't imagine things.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.868
You may imagine
I am in heaven,

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:12.872
but nothing moves here
unless you do the right thing with it.

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:16.309
You may imagine that
you're very close to God,

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.344
but nothing moves here

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:19.979
unless

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.982
something genuinely happens.

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.851
So, transforming your energies

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.153
is a more sure path,

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.221
a more certain path.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.823
You're walking on solid ground.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:34.961
And all you need is

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.329
a certain dedication,

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:39.465
an involvement in a certain practice.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:44.837
If

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:48.941
one works sufficiently upon his energies

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:53.246
the right sense of understanding
and guidance if it is done,

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.349
very easily one can get enlightened

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.751
on the level of his energy.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.988
His energy will be enlightened.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:05.758
His consciousness might not have gone beyond,

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:09.662
but his energies will be enlightened.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.367
We have any number of people
like that around us.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.068
In the last

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:17.570
15-20 years,

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.572
we have created many, many people

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:22.275
whose energies are enlightened,

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.911
but their consciousness has not risen.

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:26.012
That's a tricky game,

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.613
so we don't work on that.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.881
We just leave it.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.683
We're working on it in a certain way,

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:31.651
but we don't

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.419
try to raise people's consciousness

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.854
in a big way

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:35.788
because

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.457
it can be very, very tricky.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.426
It can take you on the wrong path
for a whole lifetime,

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.562
and at the end of your life you realize

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:44.530
you've been fooling yourself.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:48.901
We allow the mind to mature slowly, it's okay.

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.903
You can still do stupid things,

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:54.574
but because your energy has reached
a certain peak,

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:58.711
these stupid things don't really affect your life.

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:01.714
They don't rule your life anymore.

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.018
There's a very beautiful Zen story.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.023
You might have heard of this master,

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.758
he was very popular.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.760
His name was Eno.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.131
When Eno came to the monastery,

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.235
the master looked at him

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.871
and declared to everybody else,

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.440
Eno is enlightened

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.042
Then, the next day,

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.411
he put Eno in the kitchen

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:36.282
to work for next 12 years in the kitchen.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:39.886
He declared to everybody he's enlightened,

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:43.256
but then he puts him into kitchen work for 12 years,

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.686
an enlightened being,

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:49.061
because only his energy is enlightened.

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.331
His consciousness has not risen.

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:58.104
So in many ways,

00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:01.040
we have hundreds of people today around us

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.409
who are energy wise enlightened,

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.611
but their consciousness has not risen

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.114
and we are not in a hurry for that.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:11.684
That will happen,
slowly it will mature.

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.988
We could do

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.326
a certain

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.194
process.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.999
This is something we have been doing

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:30.703
with close groups of people for a long time.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:34.006
Shiva has also spoken about it.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:40.375
Shiva says,

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:44.216
When the spinal thread is touched,

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:48.621
a light begins to glow in and around you

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.328
If you place the whole attention on the

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.630
Sushumna nadi

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:01.767
and if it is properly touched,

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:05.438
then it becomes alive and it glows.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.306
Once it glows,

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:10.409
slowly the energy will mature within a very

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:12.478
short period of time,

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.815
and energy will become enlightened.

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:16.916
It glows,

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.318
you have a glow of an enlightened being,

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:20.886
but you don't have the consciousness

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.555
of an enlightened being.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:23.856
If you stand,

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.558
if you simply sit quietly

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.959
you are a powerful being.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.461
If you open your mouth, you're a fool,

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.563
that's how you will be.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.603
But it's good to be this way because

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:39.972
this is easy to achieve.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.210
This is easy to achieve,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.245
all you need is dedication,

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:48.014
especially

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:48.781
when I am around,

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.816
this is very easy to do.

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.687
If we just touch the spinal cord,

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:57.056
it can just

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:57.923
glow.
