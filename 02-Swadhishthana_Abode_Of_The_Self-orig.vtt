00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.879
The next dimension of...

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:24.640
in these seven dimensions is naturally swadhishthana.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.960
Swa-dhishthana means the abode of the self. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.280
So when one masters one's muladhara, 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.039
either it can move to a very stable body, 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.679
or a certain drunkenness of experience 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.079
or heightened levels of perception. 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.600
If one has used it for stability alone, 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.880
then swadhishthana becomes a very strong abode 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.799
of regeneration and pleasure. 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.879
If one has used it to drunkenness, 

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:17.239
then swadhishthana becomes an abode of a certain sense of bodilessness, which

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:22.879
cannot be compared to becoming like thin air, but a little distance. 

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:28.239
Because the abode of the self is established in a 

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:32.359
higher level of pleasure than the rest of the body, 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.799
then there is a little bit of separation. It is like 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.439
people pride that in certain parts of this country, 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.840
oranges come where the peel and the fruit are separate. 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.200
There is a certain sweetness in the fruit, which is not there in the peel,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.560
but they are one inside the other. Without the peel and the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.840
connections with the peel, this sweetness would have never happened, 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.319
but they are separate. So this separation will happen, 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.640
a certain sweetness of the self, but body 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.599
will be little loose on it. This will give a certain freedom 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.960
from physical drives that human beings tend to have.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.400
If one has used it… 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.520
if one has used muladhara 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.639
or the amrita to heighten their perception, 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.719
then swadhishthana also functions in this way and further 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.960
enhances that possibility, because when 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.479
energies are dominant in swadhishthana, one becomes far more alert to life around. 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.840
. When swadhishthana sadhana is done, 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.159
it gives you a certain freedom. The word... 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.479
You know, in this country, the freedom movement was 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:01.280
referred to as swatantra. 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.120
Swatantra means – swa-tantra means a technology of the self. 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.560
Swa is self, tantra means a technique or a technology, 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.439
a way to become free. Because

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.120
the biggest bondage is in the way we are reproduced 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.840
and the biggest urge is the way... 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.479
the urge for reproduction binds people in body, mind and emotion. 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.439
So swatantra means – swadhishthana and swatantra are 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.919
connected, that you have found a tantra 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.120
to release the self from these kinds of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.960
troubles, or these kind of compulsions, because 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.159
now your self is totally free.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.520
There have been many beings, who have used 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.919
swadhishthana to specific goals. 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.319
One of the important aspects of swadhishthana is 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.960
if your swadhishthana is established in a certain way, 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.360
your ability to create… 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.959
At the lowest level, it's purely reproductive. At the highest level, 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.560
you can create a god if you wish. 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.360
Now, this must be approached carefully. It's not about creating a creation. 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.560
You can create that which you consider a god. 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.079
The technology of god-making came from this 

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:40.319
because somebody has absolute control over the swadhishthana and 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.199
one can establish what is considered a divine entity. 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:52.319
When this happens, when you start creating these things, well… 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.399
Many who created divine entities 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.759
generally felt creating one divine entity was 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.000
good enough and they gave it all and they left with it, 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.759
or they gave it all and became dissipated because of that. 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.639
Some retained the possibility of doing more. 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.560
Only if all the other dimensions are on, 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.759
one can deliver a god. If your swadhishthana is on, 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.759
you may deliver a baby or you can deliver a god. 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.519
You can deliver a god and still live 

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.800
and still maintain potency only if all the other six 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.399
are equally active. Only then one can do this.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.360
The swadhishthana or the swatantra, 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.800
the tantra of making the self free, 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.839
this is, you have created a certain flexibility 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.439
to your life energies that it is no more bound 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.600
by the compulsions of the body. When I say compulsions of the body,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.519
to keep this body alive, you have to invest a certain amount of energy, 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:16.480
otherwise it will not stay alive. To keep this body healthy and capable, 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.879
you have to invest a certain amount of energy. 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.639
Without it, it will lose its capabilities, 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.319
it will lose its capacity to do things. 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.800
So, if you have to deliver a god, you have to invest all you have 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.759
into it, otherwise a divine entity will not be a possibility. 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:40.040
So there are many aspects to this. But 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.480
among all the things that you can do with your 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.800
swadhishthana, the most significant thing 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.519
is just this, that you can deliver a god. Well

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:53.399
somebody delivered us, 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:57.399
that is also important. We are not saying that is not important, 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.720
that is also important, that's why we are sitting here, 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.399
that is also an important aspect. But the highest level 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:10.439
of delivery would be delivering a divine entity.

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:14.600
Many things were done, even now it could be done, 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.879
is we could prepare 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:24.160
It is... The problem is, whatever you do with human beings, 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.480
 of all the material that you can consecrate in the world, 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.759
the easiest material to consecrate is human body. 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.920
But the easiest thing, which will turn around tomorrow morning 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:45.560
and say something else to you, is also the human mind. If

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.240
one has brought their mind to a state of 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.480
unquestioned focus towards something, 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.319
then it becomes a possibility, that you could 

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:02.240
consecrate that body to a very high level of function 

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.240
like a divine entity. 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.120
But most people in today's world are not able to 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.879
manage that focus. Every two days, 

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:17.360
"Am I doing the right thing in my life?" 

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.680
will come up. Whether you're in marriage, or in 

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.800
brahmacharya or in spirituality, this has become... 

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.680
The worst calamity that's happened to modern society is this, 

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:36.759
that they cannot stay focused on anything, they keep... 

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:40.039
Because the entire culture has become

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.879
"What will I get?" Once "What will I get?" is there, 

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:49.600
you cannot stay focused on anything. You'll be focused on this, 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.000
then suddenly a question mark will come, "What will I get? Maybe there, I'll get more." 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.279
This scavenging mind will keep on moving from here to there. 

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:02.799
In this, it becomes difficult. So one dimension 

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:05.759
of swadhishthana is also this, that

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:08.519
if you allow or if you strive 

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:13.399
to take swadhishthana above its natural compulsions, 

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:17.679
which are essentially regenerative… You must understand this, 

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.879
whatever is referred to as sexuality is not about sexuality. 

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:26.120
Nature is instigating you to reproduce. 

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.240
In modern societies, people have made it out as if 

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.000
it has a purpose of its own. 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.320
Yes, people are using it to bind themselves to each other, 

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.600
but fundamentally, the longing in the body is to reproduce.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.200
If this was not there, we wouldn't be here today. But 

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.840
if you're wanting to go somewhere else other than being a cycle of life… 

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.080
Other than being a natural cycle of life, 

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.480
if you want to go beyond the cycle,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.159
then transcending these dimensions become important.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:04.240
This use of swadhishthana is a very complex 

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.159
and a fantastic process.

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:11.200
It can be done with rituals, 

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.080
it can be done by using the body, 

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.879
it can be done by using pure energy

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:23.919
three different ways of doing it. Swadhishthana can manifest at its highest 

00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:30.559
even through the body or through 

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:37.000
raising the energies in a certain way, 

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.679
by using external substances, 

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:43.240
by using body. When I say external substances, 

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.759
generally in tantra, 

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:49.960
there are three fundamentals. These are called the lower, 

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.600
the middle and the higher. They're called kaula, mishra 

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.559
and samaya. 

00:10:56.559 --> 00:11:00.679
These... What it means is, one uses external substances. 

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:04.159
Because you have no control over your own system, 

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:07.159
you use other substances. There is a system 

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:10.679
of using these substances through which you can generate 

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:14.919
a certain level of what you could call 

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:19.480
as an energy, which functions at a higher level than you, 

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.360
which could be referred to as a divine entity.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.799
So tantrics have created various deities, 

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:29.360
which stand up and walk in their own way, 

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.159
through ritualistic process. 

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.399
He himself may not be 

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:37.120
personally evolved in any way but 

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.120
he has understood the ritual and he sticks to the ritual. 

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.879
And because he sticks to the ritual in the way it should be, 

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:48.879
suddenly something else stands up. You can see this happening 

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:52.279
in certain temples in India. 

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:55.200
The priests are just sticking to the ritual. 

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.720
They themselves may not be personally evolved in any way 

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:04.840
but they have stuck to the ritual. They've been taught never to alter the process, 

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.240
just stick to it. And suddenly, something new happens, a burst of energy happens there. 

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:17.960
This can be created but it cannot be consolidated and made to walk for a long time. 

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.639
It cannot be made to live 

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:25.559
through generations of people and stay alive. If it has to live that way, 

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:28.639
one thing is to do it through your body. 

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:33.759
If you use your body and do it, it will live a certain length of time, but 

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:38.240
if you use pure energy and do it, it will live a very long time. 

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.240
We can say almost forever 

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.559
because in human experience, if something lives for 10,000 years, 

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:49.720
it's as good as ever. 

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.240
So, it can live for a few thousands of years 

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.600
if we invest a certain amount of energy.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.919
Of all the things that we can do in this system,

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:02.559
swadhishthana is among the most complex 

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:08.840
and beautiful way of doing things. But it is also 

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:15.480
personally a dangerous way of doing things because if you do too much of it, you may... 

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.200
you may have your self but you may lose your body

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.879
A beautiful self but no body – this may happen to you 

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:26.720
if you go too much on it or if you lose control over it.
