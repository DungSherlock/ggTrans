1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,600
So what is a dream?

2
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,120
First, let's define

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,080
what we are calling as dream

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,840
because the word dream

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,400
is a little too dreamy.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
It's all over the place.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,320
We're talking about dreams,

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,840
not the Martin Luther King

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,800
kind of dreams, "I have a dream,"

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
not that kind.

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,640
You had a dream - that kind.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,840
You had a dream

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,000
not because you asked for it,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,120
you had a dream in spite of yourself.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,920
All you wanted to do was sleep, 

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
but you had a dream.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,560
You know the difference between "I have a dream"

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,280
and "I had a dream". 

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
Well,

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,120
we're talking about

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,320
something that happens in your mind

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,480
or in your experience

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
- Let's put it this way,

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,680
it happens in your experience

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,840
when you're fast asleep.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,960
For a whole lot of people,

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,360
their dreams are stronger experience

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,400
than their wakefulness unfortunately,

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,080
because in wakefulness

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,000
they are preoccupied with something

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
or the other.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,600
In dream...

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,560
Sleep has quietened other aspects

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,720
of their physiological

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
and psychological activity

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,600
and the world around you.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,720
Because of that, dream becomes

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
more vivid.

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
It's just like,

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,160
you go to a cinema theater.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
You know, people are in love with film stars

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,120
more than their family

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
and their neighbors

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
and all the people that they know

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,720
in their life,

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,000
because

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
this is the work of the darkroom.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,880
You must understand this.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,680
If you play a cinema in a well-lit hall,

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,880
nobody will be impressed by those heroes.

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,360
You must switch off the light.

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,840
Once everything else is cut off

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
Well, you will laugh with them,

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,640
you will cry with them,

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,920
you will run away with them. 

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,960
So all these things will happen

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
because of the darkroom.

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
That's what sleep is doing to you.

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,680
It's giving you a darkroom to experience

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,880
something vividly.

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
So this can happen

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,200
in four different ways.

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,640
There are four types of dreams.

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,160
These four types...

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm making it four times

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,960
The yoga, the traditional yoga,

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,120
the classical yoga multiplies

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,640
this into sixteen types of dreams.

69
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
You know, 

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm a practical 21st century guru

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,880
Because of that,

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
I divide the numbers

73
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,800
and bring it down to,

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
all below nine.

75
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,480
No complex numbers, simple numbers,

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,280
because I'm talking to a rare breed

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
of human beings

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,400
that by the time you count

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,760
ten, they're gone.

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,400
So I'm always counting within number nine.

81
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,440
Having said that,

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,400
what a dream

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,200
means is something that happened

84
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,160
in your sleep time.

85
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,560
You daydreamed - that's not it.

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,240
You were fast asleep

87
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,160
and some experience happened.

88
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,120
Many might have happened

89
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,400
that you don't remember,

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,000
but some have happened

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,760
that you clearly remember.

92
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,440
Some have happened

93
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,520
which you partially remember.

94
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,880
Some have happened that you vividly remember.

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,440
Some have happened

96
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,760
which have left physical marks upon you.

97
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,160
Some have happened

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,920
which have manifested outside in the world.

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,120
Some have happened which can direct

100
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,960
or decide the very destiny of 

101
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,040
what will happen to this being. 

102
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,960
So among these various possibilities,

103
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,040
I would categorize them into four forms.

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,240
The first one is

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,040
because people are in a...

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
largely in a

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,920
mental diarrhea.

108
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,480
And this diarrhea happens

109
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,160
because they have invested themselves

110
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,320
so much, in various types of desires,

111
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
and desiring process

112
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,640
there is no discipline,

113
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,720
or

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,120
it is not a conscious desiring process.

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
It just happens.

116
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,920
Anything that they see, they desire.

117
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,960
Because of this,

118
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,520
your psychological structure

119
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,800
creates a defense mechanism for you.

120
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,520
If you pursue every desire

121
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,160
that arises in your life,

122
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,120
you're finished

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
You will be exhausted,

124
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
and you will die soon.

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,160
So you control yourself or 

126
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,760
realities will not let you pursue

127
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,400
all those things.

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,960
Because of that,

129
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,080
they could play up in your mind.

130
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,720
Not necessarily in the same form,

131
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,680
in some way

132
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
random things - this person came,

133
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,280
that present came,

134
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
something, something, something

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,960
is happening.

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Mainly

137
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,960
the psychological framework

138
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,840
is fractured

139
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,600
because of excessive desiring.

140
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,120
Because of this fractured framework,

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,640
in the daytime also they suffer these things.

142
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,800
But they think it's normal

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,200
because if they share with somebody

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,840
who's working in their office,

145
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,240
they're also in the same state

146
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
or they're in the worse state.

147
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,960
So it's all normal.

148
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,320
After all this is life.

149
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,640
People are saying this is life.

150
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,080
So desires will happen or

151
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm sorry...

152
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,280
dreams will happen.

153
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,520
Because...

154
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,080
Because of unconscious and excessive

155
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
desiring process,

156
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
your psychological framework

157
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,760
is fragmented or fractured.

158
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,000
So, fractured dreams will happen -

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,880
random - this, this, this, this, this.

160
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,000
I would say...

161
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,760
Well, some would say...

162
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm not...

163
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm being too stringent.

164
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,840
But I would say, in my estimate,

165
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,920
eighty-five to ninety percent 

166
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,160
of the dreams fall in this category.

167
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,280
The remaining ten - twelve percent

168
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,360
will fall into other three categories.

169
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,400
The second category of dreams may be

170
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,560
because of a certain depth of sleep

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,280
which most people don't get into.

172
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,880
If they got into a very deep sleep,

173
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,160
naturally,

174
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
the sleep quota would come down

175
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,960
- that would be an indication.

176
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,840
If they get into very deep states of sleep,

177
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
certain dimensions or certain aspects of

178
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,880
the subconscious mind may unravel itself.

179
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,400
Out of relaxation,

180
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,800
what was held may just open up,

181
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,760
and some insights may happen

182
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,800
into the individual nature of that person.

183
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,600
It could be

184
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
from another time in their life

185
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
of which they have no memory

186
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
but it's deep-rooted, this may come out;

187
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,280
or it could be from another lifetime,

188
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,520
it may come out.

189
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,720
These are all subconscious storage.

190
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,880
This storage

191
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,920
because of very deep sense of relaxation,

192
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
it may so happen

193
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,560
that the subconscious

194
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,040
opened up a little bit.

195
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
It's not that all of it will pounce out.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Just somewhere

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,040
the surface of it might have opened and

198
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,680
some insights

199
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,280
into the nature of the human being

200
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,680
or that individual person

201
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,640
may be very clear in such openings.

202
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
But I'm telling you,

203
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
of all the dreams

204
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,840
that people are having

205
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
 on the planet,

206
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,800
this falls into twelve percent.

207
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
In that twelve percent,

208
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,040
this may account for 

209
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,440
four, five percent, six percent maybe.

210
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
Rest is all the fractured nature

211
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,800
of one's psychology

212
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,120
which is just playing out.

213
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,680
The third form of dream could be,

214
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,440
something is building up somewhere.

215
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,920
Let's say we are in the 

216
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,320
we are

217
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,600
 in the tornado region, all right?

218
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,440
Right now, let's say a tornado

219
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,840
is just beginning.

220
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Still, meteorological stations

221
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
have not figured it out.

222
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
It's just beginning.

223
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400
Just cooking up.

224
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,320
See, for that kind of force to cook up,

225
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,960
there are factors

226
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,120
which are coming together slowly.

227
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,720
There are atmospheric factors

228
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,120
which are coming together

229
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
to cause

230
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
or to propel

231
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,960
that kind of a phenomenal force.

232
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,760
So they are coming together

233
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,480
and you are sleeping and suddenly

234
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,040
in your sleep

235
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,160
something shook in your belly,

236
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
and maybe in your dream

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
you had loose motions.

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,480
Not really, I'm saying.

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,240
See, I pick all the bad examples,

240
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,880
or something happened,

241
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,640
or something trembled within you

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,680
and even woke you up.

243
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,200
Nothing happening, everything is fine.

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,240
The tornado may be twenty-four hours,

245
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,040
 forty-eight hours,

246
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,720
seventy-two hours away.

247
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
But

248
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,480
something happened in your dream,

249
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,920
and you may not be able to interpret this, 

250
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,280
"This is a tornado,

251
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,360
this is a cyclone,

252
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,440
this is a flood,

253
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,320
this is an accident."

254
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,920
You may not be able to figure it out.

255
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,840
It will take some amount of training

256
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,520
and observation to figure it out

257
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,320
because in different people,

258
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,920
it will manifest in different forms.

259
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,520
These are paranormal.

260
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,440
That means

261
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,040
what's happening somewhere reflects

262
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,880
in your consciousness,

263
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,000
and you become conscious about that,

264
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,720
not exactly in the same form

265
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
but in some other form.

266
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
Possible.

267
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,160
That's another small percentage.

268
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
The fourth variety of dream

269
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,000
is not really a dream at all.

270
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,960
It is...

271
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,640
If you invest your life energies

272
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,280
into the dimension,

273
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,400
in your mind which we refer to as imagination...

274
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,560
Most human beings

275
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,440
because they have not

276
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,880
spent enough time with themselves,

277
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
their imagination is simply rolling

278
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,480
like a, you know, loose can.

279
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,280
It's just running away.

280
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,960
But if you pay enough attention to yourself,

281
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,000
if you pay attention to

282
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,280
what's around you, and if you imbibe

283
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,560
the pictures of the world

284
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,960
in great detail...

285
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,120
When I say in great detail

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
- if you...

287
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
this is a moving picture,

288
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
but even if it's a still picture

289
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,840
- if you see this flower,

290
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,120
if you see it in absolute detail,

291
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,240
and you're able to create this flower

292
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,640
just like this in your mind.

293
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,880
If you close your eyes,

294
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,400
you can see this flower

295
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,640
as clearly as you're seeing right now

296
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,400
with your eyes open.

297
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,120
Because even now you're only seeing it

298
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,520
in the firmament of your mind.

299
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Your eyes may be

300
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,080
taking in the image,

301
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,840
but it is your mind which is seeing it.

302
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,520
So if you see it very carefully

303
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,760
with substantial attention...

304
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,000
This doesn't mean going on staring at it.

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
In one glance

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,040
you can see it clearly, okay?

307
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,440
But because

308
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,600
other stuff is going on,

309
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,840
you don't see it.

310
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,720
If you see it like that

311
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,080
and infuse your life energies in it

312
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,720
- that's a long way, but

313
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,480
if you can infuse -

314
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,920
you can make the flower blossom

315
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,400
and fragrance spread around you.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,800
Yes.

317
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,320
So this is how deities are made.

318
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,520
This is how consecrations are done.

319
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,920
So this is not a dream.

320
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,320
But

321
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,680
because

322
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,600
nobody has found an appropriate word

323
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
for that bridge

324
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,880
between so-called physical reality

325
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,840
and what is nonphysical,

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,000
you can put it in the category of a dream

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,560
In India, this is a common thing.

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,920
People create a deity.

329
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,200
They work on it, work on it

330
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,120
and then they make her walk, literally.

331
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,200
You've heard of Ramakrishna

332
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,640
feeding the Devi, and she eats.

333
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
Food gets over.

334
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,040
Not imagination, not deception.

335
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,360
Just you infuse so much energy

336
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,000
into the imagination dimension

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,040
of your intelligence,

338
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,760
you put that much life energy,

339
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,720
it becomes a live... living process.

340
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
It lives with you, walks with you,

341
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
it is there with you,

342
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,600
more real than real.
