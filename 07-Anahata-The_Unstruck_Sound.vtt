00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.268
Anna Hatha is symbolized with two intersecting triangles

3c23d34b-5c27-4eb3-9edc-a7a0b4160591-1
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:29.010
forming A6 pointed star Sadhguru.

710855ff-6859-4a8f-a16e-a753082aa49f-0
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.629
This is a symbolism of how the lower 3 chakras and the upper

710855ff-6859-4a8f-a16e-a753082aa49f-1
00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.730
three in the body are all meeting here as one.

9e149e20-db88-4975-b608-5f31563c8bd1-0
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.810
That means it has 6 qualities in one.

9dd68cd7-b53e-4915-8e5b-6695ef350c41-0
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.543
Generally Anahata symbol is a six pointed star with a dot in

9dd68cd7-b53e-4915-8e5b-6695ef350c41-1
00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:49.210
the center.

f689b17c-d7b8-4b88-8519-623725261c54-0
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.178
That means all the seven chakras have merged here in a certain

f689b17c-d7b8-4b88-8519-623725261c54-1
00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:53.410
way.

a4159a57-20ce-4208-9a48-68356db50d6d-0
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.706
Many cultures are using this symbolism in many different

a4159a57-20ce-4208-9a48-68356db50d6d-1
00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:02.660
connotations, but essentially it comes from this.

15790343-5ced-422c-a9fd-1e80e0b12524-0
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.658
The upward moving triangle and the downward moving triangle

15790343-5ced-422c-a9fd-1e80e0b12524-1
00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:07.180
have met.

f2dbbea8-6782-4c2c-a2b4-3e8ffdfcc48d-0
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.053
What upward moving triangle and downward moving triangle means

f2dbbea8-6782-4c2c-a2b4-3e8ffdfcc48d-1
00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:18.366
is fundamentally every creature in some way is trying to rise,

f2dbbea8-6782-4c2c-a2b4-3e8ffdfcc48d-2
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.740
whatever their understanding of rising.

49eb83d2-5ab8-4f60-9c93-15d5e1dfbfc2-0
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.992
Little worm may be wanting to climb up the tree, A bird may

49eb83d2-5ab8-4f60-9c93-15d5e1dfbfc2-1
00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:32.500
want to soar up in the sky.

d3f6a485-f034-4650-9607-84af30566113-0
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.917
A human being may wants to become rich or famous or

d3f6a485-f034-4650-9607-84af30566113-1
00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:44.020
powerful or something else or wants to get enlightened.

d894fd89-ad55-4753-addc-c94f1d5cb21a-0
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.500
All these are efforts to rise.

d09706bb-ad7f-4611-aa34-67564c6c4b35-0
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.140
So this is the nature of the creation.

193e27c0-bab6-415c-babb-61df16b67975-0
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.590
Every creature is trying to rise to its fullest potential.

c6d9fcb1-5c1d-4d56-9a55-058cf185e383-0
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.230
Some will do it consciously, most will do it unconsciously.

2f236620-a252-4aa4-aa1f-18745ba644a0-0
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.590
But everybody is trying to rise.

4d70428f-4d9c-4e89-88c1-0e37bfdf7b43-0
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.830
This is the nature of life.

a637ec08-b37a-4a41-80e6-29cee5b37ea9-0
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.590
This is creation.

a4488b43-ab10-48a4-95c2-f687531bde8a-0
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.122
But that which is the source this problem of wanting to rise

a4488b43-ab10-48a4-95c2-f687531bde8a-1
00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:24.862
has come because you are geostatic in the sense you are

a4488b43-ab10-48a4-95c2-f687531bde8a-2
00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:26.810
stuck in one place.

31b3f594-164d-4a08-aa7e-9849a9a3acfc-0
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.490
Tch, you are stuck in one place means you are here.

7298255e-01df-4a7b-a390-d9747dc14da6-0
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.730
You can only be here.

314f4935-6e9b-4930-93ee-4447016bb1dd-0
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.366
You can't be here and there because you are stuck in one

314f4935-6e9b-4930-93ee-4447016bb1dd-1
00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:41.930
place.

9534342d-666d-48e1-969f-5c0859dab723-0
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.330
You think of all the directions.

571c11cc-728f-4d07-bcbe-3ed54598deb2-0
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.610
Going up is better.

6cebc00a-60bc-40d4-bece-838d4588af34-0
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.010
It's a choice that you have made.

347c2843-7f41-4265-ad79-23fc9522220d-0
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.317
Somebody maybe just loitering around, somebody may be

347c2843-7f41-4265-ad79-23fc9522220d-1
00:02:54.317 --> 00:02:58.175
consciously wanting to go up, but essentially you have to move

347c2843-7f41-4265-ad79-23fc9522220d-2
00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:00.380
because you are stuck in one place.

ea3a90e0-d00d-4863-a35a-ad9c8066fc0b-0
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.871
That which we are referring to as the very source of

ea3a90e0-d00d-4863-a35a-ad9c8066fc0b-1
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.380
everything.

8dd21026-8ba3-417e-8d42-0e283016eaf2-0
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.643
This is not geospecific, this is not geostatic, so it moves

8dd21026-8ba3-417e-8d42-0e283016eaf2-1
00:03:11.643 --> 00:03:12.660
everywhere.

2d7e09c2-35dd-486e-8738-5f42bec0d2f5-0
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.980
It percolates into everything because it has no direction.

ef29fcff-d94c-4f53-8383-0851ca25c0cc-0
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.110
Because it has no location, you have a directional movement.

cdda439f-afd3-470e-a937-4d39acf5a204-0
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.550
Only if you are stuck in one place, isn't it?

2d4f3811-4e4c-493b-983b-a0de1c14da33-0
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.190
Only if you are geostatic, you will have a direction to go to.

7cf6fd6d-4b4d-4845-afd0-b5fbdffc8c21-0
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.910
If you are not geostatic, you're just everywhere.

f417f088-40db-46e9-8320-bf8c2f2b9e32-0
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.124
There is nowhere to go, so you just seep into everything that

f417f088-40db-46e9-8320-bf8c2f2b9e32-1
00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:38.550
is there.

45eb59ff-5692-441c-b3be-e7e5b71b6d56-0
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.430
You soak everything that's around you.

3a856f2f-26e1-4627-87f2-ff0e74408b94-0
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.405
So in this context, yogic terminology has used these two

3a856f2f-26e1-4627-87f2-ff0e74408b94-1
00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:48.510
triangles.

70590cce-7184-4b62-8a8d-79cede9d6b38-0
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.237
Creature is trying to move up the source is trying to come

70590cce-7184-4b62-8a8d-79cede9d6b38-1
00:03:55.237 --> 00:04:00.340
down into this source, does not come down or go up nothing.

ed3cfb27-23c7-4ed6-8391-2592af21045e-0
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.102
It just seeps into everything because it's not located in any

ed3cfb27-23c7-4ed6-8391-2592af21045e-1
00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:04.420
place.

01368a8e-04b9-4d4f-b990-b2c1a21338d4-0
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.020
Let's say like air.

03e72574-229e-4843-aac6-f4544b942843-0
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.700
Air enters your ears.

de2143c7-039a-4649-a5f1-fb4f6bed78e4-0
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.013
Also air enters the pores in your skin also, not just in your

de2143c7-039a-4649-a5f1-fb4f6bed78e4-1
00:04:14.013 --> 00:04:14.500
stools.

77e0a309-cb0b-4139-af4d-2d642cca96ee-0
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.292
If you open your mouth, it goes here also, it has no choice

77e0a309-cb0b-4139-af4d-2d642cca96ee-1
00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.810
about those things.

51b4f005-e687-4e85-8ccc-1dfbc2354dab-0
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.570
Wherever there is space, it will enter.

5a46c5d7-5c1e-45fb-8d9f-b5aba4f22aee-0
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.850
Similarly, let's understand it's only an analogy.

66795092-ebc5-4cd7-9b1c-66b1aeaa5df2-0
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.730
Don't start thinking on those terms.

38ed0fec-790c-41f9-bda0-3d81fc38fdd6-0
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.250
Similarly that we consider as the source is moving everywhere.

2035e1d3-ddba-4334-9ef2-7273cd308307-0
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.890
But right now if you sit here, how is air moving?

0f04e90b-244a-456c-a646-33c46ca91c4e-0
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.740
Means we see in the passage it's going down like this and coming

0f04e90b-244a-456c-a646-33c46ca91c4e-1
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.570
out like this.

058e51a9-2f95-4ff1-b62b-4bc960d4d032-0
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.520
Air is going here also here also.

74fb69dd-eabc-4e5e-8a0b-eccd321a1e0e-0
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.518
But this is the main source because if you deny this you

74fb69dd-eabc-4e5e-8a0b-eccd321a1e0e-1
00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:50.960
will die.

1fab73f6-a0c4-4a77-bace-7882084b116c-0
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.680
So you know that this is a must.

dc55ca45-d088-4d85-9f3a-3f616d0d6fa8-0
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.878
So in this context what we consider as the creature which

dc55ca45-d088-4d85-9f3a-3f616d0d6fa8-1
00:04:59.878 --> 00:05:03.999
is this one is trying to move up, this is 1 triangle, upward

dc55ca45-d088-4d85-9f3a-3f616d0d6fa8-2
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.080
moving triangle.

af6b7dcb-43f3-4286-bbe9-3cc56cccb0c1-0
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.040
What we consider as the source of the divine is coming down.

26042ccf-91e7-46ba-895f-fa933d502a24-0
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.240
This is another triangle.

fcd08175-b5ec-40a6-a159-256e7c8a1a5b-0
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.000
Downward facing triangle.

71afb9aa-adf1-461b-bd3b-84cd45ac9d18-0
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.415
Anahatha is a place where both have intersected in a alignment,

71afb9aa-adf1-461b-bd3b-84cd45ac9d18-1
00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:27.224
proper alignment forming A6
starred 6 pointed figure with a

71afb9aa-adf1-461b-bd3b-84cd45ac9d18-2
00:05:27.224 --> 00:05:28.580
central point.

8389d23e-4fa3-42a0-b4bd-73c174d55f36-0
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.340
What this means is it has many possibilities in one place.

8cb004fa-39ac-4cfd-8f4e-354631f4d2a1-0
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.758
If there are too many possibilities in one place, it

8cb004fa-39ac-4cfd-8f4e-354631f4d2a1-1
00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:44.606
is also a place where most people miss all possibilities

8cb004fa-39ac-4cfd-8f4e-354631f4d2a1-2
00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:48.454
because there are too many things happening except for a

8cb004fa-39ac-4cfd-8f4e-354631f4d2a1-3
00:05:48.454 --> 00:05:49.670
handful of people.

e378af46-3d20-431a-8370-55d5230f5122-0
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.517
I've always avoided putting people on Anahata Sadhana

e378af46-3d20-431a-8370-55d5230f5122-1
00:05:53.517 --> 00:05:57.435
because there are too many choices and there are too many

e378af46-3d20-431a-8370-55d5230f5122-2
00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:00.070
confusions to go into Anahata Sadhana.

f47077e3-0cd8-4a68-8ccb-a6daa2d55279-0
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.310
2 things are needed.

09e917bf-f46f-4699-becf-3f087565bd39-0
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.781
One thing is sweetness of emotion, another thing is

09e917bf-f46f-4699-becf-3f087565bd39-1
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:08.590
absolute.

c854025d-a502-4418-a8dc-b842805d5210-0
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.590
Steadiness of the intellect and intellect means discernment.

131edad7-8194-4d57-8668-609314fb823f-0
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.871
There must be a discernment between what is real, what is

131edad7-8194-4d57-8668-609314fb823f-1
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:21.514
not real, what is memory, what is imagination, what is

131edad7-8194-4d57-8668-609314fb823f-2
00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:24.229
experience, what is psychological stuff.

a41c22c9-7638-40c5-bb34-0435efffd7ab-0
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.059
If this discernment is not there, Anahatta is not the place

a41c22c9-7638-40c5-bb34-0435efffd7ab-1
00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:35.503
to go, because this is the place where you hear and see things in

a41c22c9-7638-40c5-bb34-0435efffd7ab-2
00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:40.040
a way that even reasonably stable person can go crazy.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.920
Somebody who has a little tendency will go all the way

337ebebf-c578-4e25-a0cc-337a3d725d79-1
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:56.292
because Anahatta, the word anahat means a sound without

337ebebf-c578-4e25-a0cc-337a3d725d79-2
00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:59.320
reverb, unstruck sound.

97f1ba84-ae61-4003-858a-8bac3f9a2d9a-0
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.060
Most of the sound on the planet happens because something

97f1ba84-ae61-4003-858a-8bac3f9a2d9a-1
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.960
strikes something.

095d2531-2114-4235-8ce5-17d7234d0016-0
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.560
This is an unstruck sound.

ebc7aa1a-df8d-4837-86a8-958c2c93d0bb-0
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.182
That is, if you simplicit in silence, all kinds of sounds

ebc7aa1a-df8d-4837-86a8-958c2c93d0bb-1
00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:10.820
will happen.

e3f9e223-bd2c-4d19-b3db-94ad1e5abbb8-0
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.315
These sounds have been identified as 108 different

e3f9e223-bd2c-4d19-b3db-94ad1e5abbb8-1
00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:18.020
varieties of sound.

d6ffdf72-ad38-432c-aa6c-1450ca65103f-0
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.857
It is out of this that different deities have been associated

d6ffdf72-ad38-432c-aa6c-1450ca65103f-1
00:07:23.857 --> 00:07:25.460
with different sounds.

710da3da-df7f-4a12-a6cf-7b1c2c3c4b8a-0
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.180
In India, if you say Shiva, it's a Dhammaru or a drum.

c181a2f5-9294-45ad-840e-f3c5a88d3b64-0
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.380
Dhammaru is a meeting of two triangles like this.

26754158-74af-4edc-b6ab-abdba25a3815-0
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.249
When two equilateral triangles meet like this, it makes a a

26754158-74af-4edc-b6ab-abdba25a3815-1
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.560
drum.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.960
When one is dominant in the Rana Hata, they start hearing things.

f3c4cda8-85af-43a0-8f48-f96bce8b491e-0
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.200
Sound of the bell?

bf790a9a-1828-49aa-944d-34b79b74bce9-0
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.280
It's real, the drum.

b53a8330-1825-4326-b0f0-1bd6ed5edf54-0
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.440
A wind instrument, like a flute.

9683032d-65c2-4d7b-93b8-9d510ea14412-0
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.104
These kind of things may start happening when you start hearing

9683032d-65c2-4d7b-93b8-9d510ea14412-1
00:08:04.104 --> 00:08:04.680
things.

45fc1e7d-5286-42d5-a9e7-95f3634daba4-0
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.530
Generally it means that you're going crazy.

a9da8ddd-e58a-440e-8401-4ed2bfc869bd-0
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.681
Hearing things is considered as the first sign of psychological

a9da8ddd-e58a-440e-8401-4ed2bfc869bd-1
00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:18.578
imbalance, and it is because those who are psychologically

a9da8ddd-e58a-440e-8401-4ed2bfc869bd-2
00:08:18.578 --> 00:08:23.558
imbalanced in some way also become perceptive in some other

a9da8ddd-e58a-440e-8401-4ed2bfc869bd-3
00:08:23.558 --> 00:08:23.890
way.

8b153d48-d065-4008-a38e-84cfc8c29e51-0
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.225
One dislocation enables them in some other way, But this kind of

8b153d48-d065-4008-a38e-84cfc8c29e51-1
00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:31.570
enabling is not good for you.

272990b4-2702-4e4b-be5b-a93fd14989f1-0
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:38.320
It is like it is like a child who's just begun to walk.

016fa7bd-1ff0-4796-ad53-67a12812ff6a-0
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.945
You put him in a marathon race because he's got legs and for

016fa7bd-1ff0-4796-ad53-67a12812ff6a-1
00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:45.600
sure he's going to damage himself.

e646828b-59db-4d48-b1af-f7271829dd03-0
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.880
So it is not that it is a bad thing, too much of a good thing.

95c63e9c-0a9c-4902-9e0b-fdb076586bb2-0
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.391
When you're not ready for it or when you're no good for it, it's

95c63e9c-0a9c-4902-9e0b-fdb076586bb2-1
00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:56.040
a bad thing.

507a66f2-7566-41c0-b923-8c674c36d11f-0
00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.902
So This is why before you hear anything, your discernment must

507a66f2-7566-41c0-b923-8c674c36d11f-1
00:09:01.902 --> 00:09:06.070
be so crystal clear and your emotion should be sweet.

150e12db-0dda-4e5d-bba0-10229509ff4c-0
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.390
Everywhere.

642d2327-511a-4e4e-97ef-1402f811d20c-0
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.903
We're going about talking about blissfulness and now we've kind

642d2327-511a-4e4e-97ef-1402f811d20c-1
00:09:11.903 --> 00:09:15.993
of got down a step lower and saying joy, joy, joy, Yogi's

642d2327-511a-4e4e-97ef-1402f811d20c-2
00:09:15.993 --> 00:09:16.910
guide to joy.

6e1be706-0221-4dfc-9b65-4ad9b2f16854-0
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.969
All this because without sweetness of emotion, there are

6e1be706-0221-4dfc-9b65-4ad9b2f16854-1
00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:25.710
too many things that you cannot do.

5c5726a9-384a-4180-84a4-0e3840af84b2-0
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.441
Without sweetness of emotion, you are denying yourself the

5c5726a9-384a-4180-84a4-0e3840af84b2-1
00:09:32.441 --> 00:09:35.810
universe, including everything here.

43cf64e5-297e-4c0b-9a3f-d35ed1f457d2-0
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.790
Only when emotions you have mastered the emotion to become

43cf64e5-297e-4c0b-9a3f-d35ed1f457d2-1
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.650
very sweet doesn't matter what.

174cb942-6c2b-445d-8b76-d15cfa05e4f9-0
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.472
Now going into different explorations is fine, because

174cb942-6c2b-445d-8b76-d15cfa05e4f9-1
00:09:48.472 --> 00:09:53.773
otherwise you go into Anahata, you see something, you hear

174cb942-6c2b-445d-8b76-d15cfa05e4f9-2
00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:55.930
something, you may come.

5b666b6f-f4ab-4e5d-95b5-5ca11c13957d-0
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:56.810
Terrorized.

96806369-e66b-4bf4-9d68-dc206b00880d-0
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.610
Yes, truly terrorized.

99f70d8e-731c-410a-99a9-a6bd91e3d40c-0
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:10.847
Suppose you see something like this, something you think is

99f70d8e-731c-410a-99a9-a6bd91e3d40c-1
00:10:10.847 --> 00:10:11.990
terrible.

e9f4b484-861a-4680-9c65-befe0a089163-0
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:19.750
See, your idea of something being terrible is I'm I'm.

3e5fbf07-3782-455c-bd91-f19430a08ddf-0
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.072
I'm not seen too many, but sometimes when I'm switching

3e5fbf07-3782-455c-bd91-f19430a08ddf-1
00:10:24.072 --> 00:10:28.550
channels, I get to see what is considered a horror movie.

e139a72a-ae1d-4f39-bad3-e3ac170b22ac-0
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.430
It's pathetic.

18d0fd58-ce7e-49f9-a321-8b8e30fc9048-0
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.770
It doesn't horrify me.

a9df85bf-c82f-4346-b996-50b6d3c83aaa-0
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.610
It just horrifies me that some director has a mind like this.

0834be4c-4444-492b-8528-09abe7c31128-0
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.850
Blood will suddenly come out of the ice.

faa4ae90-14ba-4f9c-ba2d-2fc6f48a50c3-0
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.410
Blood is always flowing in the body.

0df35a4d-acb6-4af7-bbf6-1c9dad7aa7b4-0
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.090
If little leak happens, what is so horrifying about it?

ba5505dd-b00f-4ac7-9dfa-f01763dc91ae-0
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:55.650
I'm asking.

1d750e05-c7b3-439d-b1cd-4f99bc47b777-0
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.410
From wherever it leaked.

4b7a3e91-0699-48e4-ae20-28856dbed29e-0
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:01.890
What does it matter?

ef734b7e-e316-4a7c-b3b0-8d2826d3f94c-0
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.490
I am asking.

90b13a37-36e1-4dbd-91fa-07853e026dbe-0
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.370
No, no, it's supposed to be horror.

1cab9780-240b-4a9b-9192-a38c5c1ff653-0
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.250
Because a whole lot of people are innocent of these things.

8120f1fe-e0cd-46f4-9a2b-d0ac2b98ddf5-0
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.610
They don't know blood is flowing, tch.

cb241d30-1297-4176-ade1-6888a4e73394-0
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.690
They think they are like this.

e3429188-cf37-4f49-aad1-8eab43d48ecf-0
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.293
So for such people who are in such ignorance, suddenly

e3429188-cf37-4f49-aad1-8eab43d48ecf-1
00:11:21.293 --> 00:11:23.370
something from within happened.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.450
Images came up.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.370
Anna Hatha is the place.

cbf82a82-ab8e-40e8-810b-dbf444ddab42-0
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:35.740
Nahata is a fantastic place, but I find in today's world, getting

cbf82a82-ab8e-40e8-810b-dbf444ddab42-1
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:42.358
people to sharpen their mind and turning their emotions sweet is

cbf82a82-ab8e-40e8-810b-dbf444ddab42-2
00:11:42.358 --> 00:11:43.580
quite a job.

c219532a-c03f-4a44-941f-cb0b829f3a00-0
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.260
Yogi's Guide to joy.

cb1d28c1-769b-4a3c-9257-e03d8cf54c05-0
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.940
Is it working?
