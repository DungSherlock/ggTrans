joy comes and goes

like breeze

but miseries stick in you like thorns

until you realize it's all you're making

one must always wonder

why though in comparison

to one's moments of misery moments of

joy

may hugely outnumber them

but still

the moments of misery in your life

seem to have a more ruling dispensation

over you

this is simply because

the moment you say

you don't want something in your mind

well that's what your mind starts doing

so what is been unpleasant for you

what has been a bad experience for you

somewhere you reject it in that

rejection

it becomes a constant repetitive force

in your life

if you want to experiment

just

do this for yourself

in the next 30 seconds don't think of a

monkey

the harder you try

the more you will dwell upon the monkeys

so this is the nature

of your mind if you say

i do not want something or you resist to

reject something

that will dominate your mind

above all

both

pleasant and unpleasant situations

what you experience is misery and joy

both are your making

because all human experience happens

within you

and what happens within you is

essentially your making it's your karma

this is what karma means

that means

whatever you're experiencing right now

is your making what the world throws at

you

may not always be your choice but what

you make out of it is 100 your choice

when you exercise the choice

you have taken charge of your karma

and you're on the highway to liberation

sky
