[03/11/2023, 09:39:23] Huệ Dũng: Hi Riyas

[03/11/2023, 09:42:41] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Namaskaram 🙏🏻 sure may I know your name ?

[03/11/2023, 09:47:21] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Gurupooja preferably should be l done before Bhuta Shudhi, it is okay to do after also
[03/11/2023, 09:48:44] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Inner engineering crash course better suit after guru pooja before Bhuta shudhi
[03/11/2023, 09:50:00] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Rest of the practice order is correct 🙏🏻
[03/11/2023, 09:51:33] Huệ Dũng: My current Shambhavi practice time is usually longer than 21 minutes, maybe 25-30 minutes, is there any problem? Some reasons for lengthening time are as follows:
1. Sukha Kriya: To estimate the time of 6-7 minutes, I count 33 one-way breaths (exhale count 1 beat, inhale count 1 beat). I breathe slowly and gently so I don't feel the breath touching my palm so it can take 7-9 minutes to complete Sukha Kriya.
2. Fluttering of breath: I count quickly up to 600 for 3 minutes but usually end at 5 minutes because I'm not used to rapid breathing. This time is gradually decreasing and I can breathe more regularly.
[03/11/2023, 09:53:59] Huệ Dũng: Better order:
- IE Crash Course
- Guru Pooja
- Bhuta Shuddhi
[03/11/2023, 11:13:33] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Is there instruction to count your breath ?
[03/11/2023, 11:14:40] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Actually no.
[03/11/2023, 11:18:22] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: When you count your breath your focus will be some way reduced on your breath. So please don’t do anything beyond the instruction
[03/11/2023, 11:19:09] Huệ Dũng: Sadhguru talked about a goal of 240 breaths per minute so I used 200 counts to estimate my approximate breathing time.
[03/11/2023, 11:19:37] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: It is okay if the timing is slightly more than 21 minutes. But if it’s beyond 25 minutes, you can reduce the time for your sukha Kriya or fluttering of breath
[03/11/2023, 11:19:46] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Did he say to count ?
[03/11/2023, 11:19:49] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: 😊
[03/11/2023, 11:20:58] Huệ Dũng: No hihi! Is there an efficient way to estimate time instead of counting?
[03/11/2023, 11:21:42] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: If we look shambavi as a like an aerobic workout or something then the target is to achieve the goal . If we go that way we will lose the whole beautiful possibility of shambavi 😊🙏🏻
[03/11/2023, 11:23:09] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Your awareness will take you there as you focus on the instructions more closely and naturally the timing will fall in place. Slightly off is fine ‎<This message was edited>
[03/11/2023, 11:26:36] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Now you know that the sukha Kriya you are doing is more that 6-7 minutes, next time you reduce the time a little and see the clock after you finish the practice. If it is still more than 21 minutes you can reduce a bit next time. Please don’t count then it become something else. Keep your awareness on the breath while doing sukha Kriya
[03/11/2023, 11:27:45] Huệ Dũng: Really grateful to you for the instructions to get me back on the right path. Perhaps due to my habit of counting time while holding asanas, I use it to estimate the time during this period.
[03/11/2023, 11:28:39] Huệ Dũng: Thus, counting should not be done in any exercise (Sukha Kriya, Breath).
[03/11/2023, 11:30:09] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: This is ideal atleast 240 breath per minutes but you don’t count. You flutter as fast you can. You can exceed more than 240 also. Then if you are doing as rapid as you can for 3-4 minutes then 240 or not is not really a question ‎<This message was edited>
[03/11/2023, 11:30:49] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: For AUM chanting yes you need to count
[03/11/2023, 11:32:05] Huệ Dũng: Can I use a very small sound (like a bell) to remind me of the time? (Of course it's not music or anything else)
[03/11/2023, 11:32:22] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: No
[03/11/2023, 11:32:53] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Then you will shift your attention outward this is not good for the practice
[03/11/2023, 11:33:33] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: You’re too much worried about timing even after sadhguru has mentioned that it’s not a problem 🤣
[03/11/2023, 11:34:13] Huệ Dũng: Thank you so much Riyas for the advice. I will follow the instructions you gave me
[03/11/2023, 11:34:45] Huệ Dũng: Can I ask you questions related to Hatha Yoga?
[03/11/2023, 11:35:59] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: In the beginning it’s common to vary but over a period of time if you keep you focus on Sadhana you will see the timing will fall in place. If you use something else to keep your timing you will always need that 😇🙏🏻

But if you sharpen your awareness you will see naturally it comes to you
[03/11/2023, 11:36:17] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Sorry I am not a hatha yoga teacher hence I cannot 🙏🏻
[03/11/2023, 11:37:17] Huệ Dũng: Once again, thank you very much for your help!
[03/11/2023, 11:40:07] Huệ Dũng: What activities take place during Satsang and how long each session will take
[03/11/2023, 11:54:34] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Are you attending in person Satsang ?
[03/11/2023, 12:06:38] Huệ Dũng: I plan to attend the online session and need a little more information to plan
[03/11/2023, 14:18:15] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: There will be guided shambavi session and sadahguru’s discourse.
[03/11/2023, 14:19:10] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: I highly recommend you to attend Satsang especially since you have recently started practicing shambavi
[03/11/2023, 14:20:15] Huệ Dũng: What is the cost and time for Online Satsang sessions?
[03/11/2023, 14:21:01] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: It’s free of cost
[03/11/2023, 14:21:46] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Satsang is made as life long free offering for anyone who is done shambavi
[03/11/2023, 14:21:56] Huệ Dũng: I remember in the IE program that you should attend 4 Satsangs, right?
[03/11/2023, 14:22:20] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: I hope one day you can attend in person Satsang in your city also
[03/11/2023, 14:22:59] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Minimum to get your practice corrected each time
[03/11/2023, 14:23:31] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: you can see to attend it every month. It’s great tool to connect 🙏🏻
[03/11/2023, 14:47:12] Huệ Dũng: Hope to have the opportunity to experience Sadhguru's presence
[03/11/2023, 14:53:59] Huệ Dũng: In the Satsang program, can I interact with the teacher in any way or will I listen and follow instructions like in the IE program?
[03/11/2023, 14:58:36] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: There will be Q&A chat
[03/11/2023, 14:59:00] Huệ Dũng: The cat stretch warm-up exercise is to hold the position for 10 seconds, should I count it or not? Other warm-up positions are performed in 2 minutes, so how to estimate the time? Counting is probably a bad habit of To
[03/11/2023, 15:10:20] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: This is coming from a though only if you count you will know the time. 
No it’s not like that even without counting you will know how long it is. 

Anyways it need not be exact same second. Slight variation is okay.
[07/11/2023, 14:49:08] Huệ Dũng: Sukha Kriya is performed with slow, deep breathing. Does this deep breath need to be inhaled or exhaled completely? Slow breathing can make it take longer to breathe in or out and require little effort to inhale and/or exhale completely.
[07/11/2023, 14:51:28] Huệ Dũng: If the breath is fast, the sound will come out from the throat (similar to the breath in Surya Kriya) or the breath will be slow.
[07/11/2023, 14:52:39] Huệ Dũng: When doing rapid breathing, is it correct that the abdominal area below the heart chakra tends to contract and expand with the rapid breathing?
[07/11/2023, 15:12:25] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Namaskaram Dung 🙏🏻

You have to remember below things when you do sukha. 

Start and end the Kriya with an exhalation through left nostril

Breath fully in and fully out 

Slowly in and slowly out.
[07/11/2023, 15:13:25] Huệ Dũng: Yes, I do remember this!
[07/11/2023, 15:15:09] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: No if you do it as above there won’t be any sound coming.
[07/11/2023, 15:16:13] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: Even in surya Kriya there is no sound when you breath ideally . But if it’s happening it’s okay.
[07/11/2023, 15:18:26] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: ‎This message was deleted.
[07/11/2023, 15:22:04] ie-Riyas-Hong Kong: When you do rapid breathing you inhale and exhale rapidly at the very edge of the nostrils. If you do it properly there wont be much of movement at the abdominal area.  If it’s happening it may be because you are doing deep breathing rather than spluttering. In the beginning it’s normal. Slowly with the regular practice you should be able to reduce the movements in the abdominal area
[07/11/2023, 15:23:52] Huệ Dũng: So can I understand that the rapid breathing in Surya Kriya and Shambhavi is the same type of breathing or is there any difference between the two types of breathing in these two practices?
[07/11/2023, 15:28:25] Huệ Dũng: When watching models perform rapid breathing during the course, I noticed that the muscles in the throat were used while breathing. Does this technique support rapid breathing and how to do it correctly?
