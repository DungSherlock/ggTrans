69921b5f-b015-4354-9441-8ef83f1dc77d-0
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.800
stomach region. For Chinmaya
Mudra

8ba41e92-1cbe-4fa0-a29b-7a91c08dcb46-0
00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.130
it is in chest region.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.070
Par Adi Mudra

92036ce0-ea5e-4574-901f-f331f65dab15-0
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:39.340
it is in

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:43.400
throat region.

554b13f2-9a26-441d-bb79-1a14c420bf78-0
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:48.384
So when you utter the sound are holding chin mudra and when you

554b13f2-9a26-441d-bb79-1a14c420bf78-1
00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:51.823

554b13f2-9a26-441d-bb79-1a14c420bf78-2
00:48:51.823 --> 00:48:55.499
who ma with mouth closed holding adi mudra you can notice the

554b13f2-9a26-441d-bb79-1a14c420bf78-3
00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:58.938
vibrations in the stomach region, chest region and in the

554b13f2-9a26-441d-bb79-1a14c420bf78-4
00:48:58.938 --> 00:49:00.480
throat region accordingly.

50ca4538-e023-4ca5-824b-1bc3c19ae4c5-0
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:05.870
Now this is not about the knowledge. It is not like

bda3fec3-0e46-46a3-b539-c8c18d4e45d5-0
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.060
yes, yes I know

579da2f2-cb44-4808-8b56-7a82f0d13ba5-0
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.538
if I say I will notice a vibrations in the naval region,

579da2f2-cb44-4808-8b56-7a82f0d13ba5-1
00:49:12.538 --> 00:49:15.070
It is not. So it doesn't work like that.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.410
So each and every time you utter the sound,

8dd49533-c41c-4c1d-8da8-b3438d50e0f1-0
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:22.316
you completely be with the vibrations that are created by

8dd49533-c41c-4c1d-8da8-b3438d50e0f1-1
00:49:22.316 --> 00:49:22.860
Naadapriya.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.020
Only if you internalise the
Kriya this way

4c4e254b-39d6-44df-b30a-7e2da8487b91-0
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.540
you will be able to reap the benefits beyond physical.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.150
Making the sound, you expel the air. Forcefully

c047155a-6d6f-4c89-a797-3f7decfbb275-0
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:26.150
expelling the air bending forward, you tuck your head in

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:31.182

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.316
By the time you reach your knees, you must be completely

57f18d1f-1d9a-4231-869d-0290b7356a52-1
00:51:17.316 --> 00:51:18.350
empty of the breath.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.630
you can come out of Vajrasana properly on your own.

now your physical posture does not allow you to go that far.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.689
You go as far as you can go, but do not raise your body from

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.220
remaining in Marathi,

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.000
so you do not raise your hips like this.

3e6008a0-b9c4-49db-9cdc-37db6e5bd77d-0
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:21.660
You go as far as you can go, then take your head in,

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.870
stay there for 3 to 4 seconds.
As you inhale, you come up.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:46.830
Now we will look at a few common corrections for Dauti as well as

991da83d-c626-4f48-ac6c-e2f81c20e291-1
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:47.360

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.811
So when you hold when you are doing dauti, many of you have

803f9d4e-9551-48f4-87d7-92aea9d35604-1
00:53:52.811 --> 00:53:57.023
the tendency not to hold chin mudra in the hands. So make sure

803f9d4e-9551-48f4-87d7-92aea9d35604-2
00:53:57.023 --> 00:54:00.701
you hold chin mudra as you dauti. For some of you, the

803f9d4e-9551-48f4-87d7-92aea9d35604-3
00:54:00.701 --> 00:54:02.640
sound is not coming properly.

Now we will look at a few common corrections along with the

73bc8098-92d1-4e31-b99c-a51009e135f3-1

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.010
some of you are taking your neck back and using it like a whip.

bb77885d-fb37-448b-84f1-bd03b6524c60-0
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:10.630

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:40.053
Some of you are following the fingers holding the 4 fingers

85422282-5074-4b3b-acc3-173ad1120b8b-1

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:09.772
Keep your thumbs pointing straight up, perpendicular to

944df2ab-65f8-4b7b-8267-c79ee20ea3c1-1

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:06.690
Place the hands on the middle of the thighs so that the elbows

f87d3039-fdda-42da-a1a9-e30fd144647f-1
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.580
are naturally close to the body.

5c7379b5-e51d-477f-9622-8e8a197632d4-0
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.220
Do not keep the elbows away from the body.

f94dc527-fc10-4b7a-bfac-e480da7534e8-0
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.780
Your elbows should be close to the body.

c9a91adb-4c30-4027-a54f-087370453778-0
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.240
Do not keep the palms raised.

9e5fced4-d40d-4e6b-ae16-080e5911d927-0
01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:39.610
Your palms should be on your thighs.

751b3bb9-7124-4b3c-8101-a39e0d020e26-0
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.515
So the next time when you do the
Kriya you can incorporate all

751b3bb9-7124-4b3c-8101-a39e0d020e26-1
01:00:50.515 --> 01:00:52.860
these corrections in Mudra
Kriya. Sorry in

4328f2cf-c683-4f92-800a-7519e761968f-0
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.220
Nadaka.

b65291cc-1223-426b-94af-88dd38a7a362-0
01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.650
Now the next Mudra we are going to do is called Mudra Kriya.

ee74bd7e-7f79-4cf6-aecc-510d93aec46b-0
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:05.260
In this Kriya you will breathe remembering

a99eb657-05f1-489e-8257-bef3fc9ec3fc-0
01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.960
4 points to breathing.

083eace1-f371-4b90-8b0a-65c9115ca4bf-0
01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:13.370
Do you remember the 4 points to breathing?

5f3a792c-ff89-4e85-bac1-96ac02548953-0
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.550
The 4 points to breathing are

7846da92-6855-4a98-a73f-8c4fa622f4a4-0
01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:19.140
breathe fully,

ea0792e8-b841-49bd-9eaf-9080380d4fa8-0
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.070
Polly in fully out.

65901cc3-10a7-4a13-b175-9f2ce6d4cf6f-0
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:27.440
Breathe slowly, slowly in, slowly out.

6993b7ef-7577-45c9-a12d-6ffdd64e115d-0
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.646
There should be no jerks. Jerks means you do not do it like

6993b7ef-7577-45c9-a12d-6ffdd64e115d-1
01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:31.910
this.

f94e987e-ab7d-4269-bfa4-14e348bddfb8-0
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.110
It should be one smooth inhalation and exhalation.

cc9077ae-d378-4ffd-8568-88c43c3911b5-0
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.880
Now 4 to 52 ratio. You can estimate it like this,

97ceb3f1-bbc2-45f3-9e5a-ed4a80529c2f-0
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.371
Sorry. The 4th point of breathing is when you exhale

97ceb3f1-bbc2-45f3-9e5a-ed4a80529c2f-1
01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.930
there should be sound from the pit of the throat. So what are

97ceb3f1-bbc2-45f3-9e5a-ed4a80529c2f-2
01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:54.800
the 4 points? Breathe fully,
Fully in, fully out.

9c1cb544-56e5-48b3-a43b-6dc37689d974-0
01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.320
Bridge slowly, slowly and slowly out.

e3aa10f9-9049-4f69-97c9-c634ed9275aa-0
01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.660
There should be no jerks.

644aa773-75a5-48b4-a2c8-a02e16d8713e-0
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.670
It should be one smooth inhalation and exhalation,

af052a19-88cf-4392-ad9b-aa36abb340bc-0
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.754
and when you exhale there should be a sound from the pit of the

af052a19-88cf-4392-ad9b-aa36abb340bc-1
01:02:07.754 --> 01:02:10.060
throat. These are the 4 points to breathing

cb35239d-08af-4e01-b2dc-cfa6e89634ba-0
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.120
and 4 to 52 ratio. You can estimate it like this.

6c18ccb9-78e7-4e13-82ab-187fa08f1bc9-0
01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:18.670
You inhale fully and slowly.

53ab8b20-08ad-4f61-bcda-409747487957-0
01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.960
It is different for different people.

5d69b252-1403-4aaf-976b-568601db2475-0
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.940
Let's say you take this much time for the inhalation.

b556c907-2858-4cf1-a698-74fcc12a5eba-0
01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.960
Whatever the time you took for inhalation, that is 4

347c10c9-58bf-40f8-a1a2-e8e6084d72b2-0
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.003
when you hold the fullness, you hold it for approximately half

347c10c9-58bf-40f8-a1a2-e8e6084d72b2-1
01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:38.460
the time you took for inhalation, which is 2.

87f00fa5-bf0f-47ac-b2bf-e0dea7b199da-0
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:44.135
When you exhale, you ensure your exhalation is slightly longer

87f00fa5-bf0f-47ac-b2bf-e0dea7b199da-1
01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:46.160
than the inhalation, which is 5.

b6f93763-5481-4785-aa11-ff31ee83a050-0
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.287
When you hold the emptiness, once again you hold it as long

b6f93763-5481-4785-aa11-ff31ee83a050-1
01:02:53.287 --> 01:02:57.430
as you have the fullness, which is 2, so 4252.

846233c3-f474-4dfa-8420-bf51bb331cc7-0
01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:05.974
This 4252 is not in terms of numbers, counts, calculation or

846233c3-f474-4dfa-8420-bf51bb331cc7-1
01:03:05.974 --> 01:03:10.370
seconds. This is a certain approximation.

247763e1-b8c0-4e4e-8461-df7e97a3e448-0
01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:14.847
Now what is the first point to breathing when you do Mudra

247763e1-b8c0-4e4e-8461-df7e97a3e448-1
01:03:14.847 --> 01:03:15.130
Kriya?

7954f9a9-16c0-4078-84c7-47a5d8a3a59f-0
01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:21.154
The first point to breathing is to inhale fully. When can you

7954f9a9-16c0-4078-84c7-47a5d8a3a59f-1
01:03:21.154 --> 01:03:22.090
inhale fully?

31fb215d-3d52-4a76-b359-d8905f8af7f7-0
01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:28.881
If you are empty inside So always ensure you start Mudra

31fb215d-3d52-4a76-b359-d8905f8af7f7-1
01:03:28.881 --> 01:03:31.070
Kriya with an acceleration.

148e2cfb-641b-487d-bcf4-5f8ec213df0a-0
01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:37.103
So we will be doing Mudra Kriya holding 4 mudra for mudras that

148e2cfb-641b-487d-bcf4-5f8ec213df0a-1
01:03:37.103 --> 01:03:38.020
is chin Mudra

08be489d-962f-4c05-b956-2d332a6c1b9a-0
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.110
chinmaya mudra

afba8d65-c13b-48b4-892e-2032c64c1a34-0
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:44.290
adi mudra

7011ccdc-6e35-45a2-ae57-fafdce052a63-0
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.340
merudand samudra.

c51e395d-3d93-4215-a432-475a896485c4-0
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:54.013
So here we will be keeping the time for each of the mudras. Do

c51e395d-3d93-4215-a432-475a896485c4-1
01:03:54.013 --> 01:03:58.510
it till I ask you to switch. So you inhale fully, slowly.

e2002717-5f2d-443b-89f0-0b6f84045e62-0
01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.271
Hold your breath for approximately half the time you

e2002717-5f2d-443b-89f0-0b6f84045e62-1
01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.140
took for inhalation.

21a2cd2f-37a0-40a1-ae51-5b9ec815f5ea-0
01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:09.066
Exhale fully, slowly, slightly longer than the inhalation,

21a2cd2f-37a0-40a1-ae51-5b9ec815f5ea-1
01:04:09.066 --> 01:04:12.130
making the sound from the pit of the throat.

3d68569b-f705-4708-a413-70bd77b5dc2b-0
01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.971
Hold the emptiness as long as you have the fullness. This is

3d68569b-f705-4708-a413-70bd77b5dc2b-1
01:04:17.971 --> 01:04:22.113
one cycle. When I ask you to switch, you complete the cycle

3d68569b-f705-4708-a413-70bd77b5dc2b-2
01:04:22.113 --> 01:04:25.980
and then switch to the next mudra. If you breathe once,

3d68569b-f705-4708-a413-70bd77b5dc2b-3
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:29.777
remembering 4 points to breathing and 4 to 5 to ratio,

3d68569b-f705-4708-a413-70bd77b5dc2b-4
01:04:29.777 --> 01:04:31.020
that is one cycle.

585c1fed-1395-4782-9f33-4da61d35fe7d-0
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:33.910
Now we will start with Chin mudra.

3f7a4cbf-5fca-44a5-a6b8-820913e5de05-0
01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:35.900
First Mudra

8890162a-1a31-4c1a-abc9-0b81c263a73a-0
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:39.510
sit in vajrasana. Check the 4

01:12:01.279 --> 01:12:02.030
Kriya will happen,

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.000

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.798
Just by breathing the Kriya will not happen. You need to

84ce521e-7d19-4881-a0bd-d454dc62a873-1
01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.400

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.580
It is not about the breath.

87adac4b-1e4b-4e31-a38d-2645b27123cf-0
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.160

d86f9e24-d605-4fc2-9416-6822fae255a0-1
01:12:36.562 --> 01:12:37.570
kriya will happen.

01:12:57.241 --> 01:12:59.110
to switch to the next mudra.

Check the 4 points.

That means you will do the same

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.750
you can just go to the.

01:53:06.850 --> 01:53:07.970
So what's being done is

56cb4111-eb7f-4295-ba82-e14697cdd3c8-0
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.590

01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:15.700
holding Purna mudra. You do 15
to 20 kapalabhati.

81064b03-8964-411e-8281-2348e5244e32-0
01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:21.686
There must be a space of second and half gap between each

81064b03-8964-411e-8281-2348e5244e32-1
01:53:21.686 --> 01:53:24.440
kapalabhati. If you do it very fast

7496429c-199a-4cc6-bfbb-81bdf2953b0d-0
01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:27.490
you will not be able to continue

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:33.107
because it takes second half for the air to get back into the

66436a41-0ed4-4bfa-8317-7766be4fba1e-1
01:53:33.107 --> 01:53:33.500

01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:37.030
initially. If you are not able to make the sound,

774336ce-3463-4ed8-9c2c-0d4f4b37229f-0
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:39.280
you first open your mouth,

aaccb4f6-f9b5-429f-a277-d20bbbb30bea-0
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.960
make the sound,

e80ff15b-d2aa-4ecf-9faa-9329d5423a5a-0
01:53:41.590 --> 01:53:43.720
close your mouth and continue doing it.

1734b1f2-7183-4505-a220-1a3d6372fe96-0
01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:47.520
Now if you

7f4ad082-55ad-4575-9874-db1a529df804-0
01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:48.950
empty it,

0ab59c69-0502-4b62-b301-a729ef55fc41-0
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:52.949
as I said, there should be a space of second half between one

0ab59c69-0502-4b62-b301-a729ef55fc41-1
01:53:52.949 --> 01:53:54.240
kapalbhati and the other.

5bdc9b8a-d024-4608-8dcc-f1b00f7a24f5-0
01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:58.992
So if you empty it, it will get back. But you should you should

5bdc9b8a-d024-4608-8dcc-f1b00f7a24f5-1
01:53:58.992 --> 01:54:00.400
not notice an inhalation

09515583-bb97-4b60-bbd9-d6d7c41dfa4d-0
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:04.737
when you do kapalbhati. You should not do it like this. That

09515583-bb97-4b60-bbd9-d6d7c41dfa4d-1
01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:04.880
is,

f3385e4d-ad3c-4250-a85d-6c7e2c6efcaf-0
01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.530
this is not kapalabhati. You do it in such a way as if there is

f3385e4d-ad3c-4250-a85d-6c7e2c6efcaf-1
01:54:13.530 --> 01:54:17.138
no inhalation. There is an inhalation. You create a, you

f3385e4d-ad3c-4250-a85d-6c7e2c6efcaf-2
01:54:17.138 --> 01:54:21.000
create a vacuum and it just sucks back into you immediately.

68241bdc-ab33-4445-9a40-80410e7cec36-0
01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:24.110
But you should not notice an inhalation

0d726cc4-869a-433d-888d-0e5ee9f078e6-0
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:27.440
after the last kapalabhati.

2ddd87ba-6499-4cd7-b980-2ffa3b33d139-0
01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:31.480
Do not allow the air to get back into immediately.

7141a870-3df6-4c8b-9e5f-950881702404-0
01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:36.640
Hold Sonika or emptiness for a couple of seconds.

01:54:37.690 --> 01:54:41.390
Make use of these 2 seconds to completely tighten the arms,

893c216f-cfe2-4620-a977-8f981d79c157-0
01:54:42.730 --> 01:54:43.920
then inhale fully.

4c2622f7-e0c6-4d06-8c2a-c7aaaa9288e5-0
01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.910
Take your head back, Sachin, bring it down.

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-0
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:53.195
There are 3 moments in this, but it should happen in one fluid

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-1
01:54:53.195 --> 01:54:57.030
motion. This is known as the
Jalandhara bandha or the neck

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-2
01:54:57.030 --> 01:55:01.125
lock. Once you engage the next clock, you will notice a little

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-3
01:55:01.125 --> 01:55:05.350
bit of toughness in the muscles.
Where the rib cage ends and the

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-4
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:09.055
diaphragm begins. There is a soft spot which will become

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-5
01:55:09.055 --> 01:55:12.890
taught once you notice it. It is a diaphragm lock. It is a

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-6
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:16.595
diaphragm lock or the udayana
Banda. Once you notice the

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-7
01:55:16.595 --> 01:55:20.560
diaphragm lock, you consciously construct and pull your ****

1755fe18-d442-4be2-acf3-0afcc0307f8c-8
01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.210
muscles up

86a632dd-8971-4cc2-961b-3c432cb6a162-0
01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:21.880
and hold it.

9cc5c63b-50ef-4691-a288-79c0eb9cca18-0
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.206
So once you engage in a clock, the diaphragm lock and the inner

9cc5c63b-50ef-4691-a288-79c0eb9cca18-1
01:55:27.206 --> 01:55:30.953
lock, the diaphragm lock will happen by itself. Once you

9cc5c63b-50ef-4691-a288-79c0eb9cca18-2
01:55:30.953 --> 01:55:35.094
notice the diaphragm lock, you consciously engage the analogue

9cc5c63b-50ef-4691-a288-79c0eb9cca18-3
01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:39.301
with these 3 locks. Stay here on fullness of the breath as long

9cc5c63b-50ef-4691-a288-79c0eb9cca18-4
01:55:39.301 --> 01:55:43.179
as it is comfortable for you.
When you feel like exhaling,

54f9b4d9-7da3-469b-b7d5-c9464f681d4f-0
01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:45.000
bring your head up.

11bb39cc-e541-4dfa-8d00-8c13175a30a0-0
01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:49.573
Excel through nozzles, making the sound from the pit of the

11bb39cc-e541-4dfa-8d00-8c13175a30a0-1
01:55:49.573 --> 01:55:53.660
throat. After the exhalation is complete, you relax the poorna

11bb39cc-e541-4dfa-8d00-8c13175a30a0-2
01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:54.050
mudra.

01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:58.961
After you like the poonam mudra, you relax the inner lock. OK, I

2b9106fd-39bd-475a-95d1-9fd2228926a6-1
01:55:58.961 --> 01:56:01.200
will repeat once again. Please tell it

225d6d11-8e6a-4561-9162-aeb35ce21ffc-0
01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:05.790
so. Have you do this is sitting in Vajrasana

ae6a57af-8829-409c-99d4-0db78cffa78d-0
01:56:06.490 --> 01:56:07.830
holding Purna mudra,

a417f41d-db92-45b6-9d7a-a8190ebeb6f4-0
01:56:08.710 --> 01:56:12.110
You can do 15 to 20 kapalbhati per cycle.

eb54dd79-4661-4c1f-8c73-97238d8e7c0b-0
01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:17.038
There must be a second and a half gap between each

eb54dd79-4661-4c1f-8c73-97238d8e7c0b-1
01:56:17.038 --> 01:56:17.670
Kapalabhati

Now we will look at a few common corrections for math prakriya.

9549089b-3379-48d6-9b71-77bb1858bd87-1
02:01:33.186 --> 02:01:35.710
You can place it in Ardra
Siddhasana and observe

02:01:41.250 --> 02:01:44.580
while doing kapalbhati. Do not judge the whole body,

79fcfa4d-63cd-43fe-b387-6ee0d274e9b2-0
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:50.820
just the diaphragm should move.

aa65716c-618e-4291-879f-c7141085703b-0
02:02:00.850 --> 02:02:05.162
For some people the gap between
2 kapalabhati is less. It is

aa65716c-618e-4291-879f-c7141085703b-1
02:02:05.162 --> 02:02:08.980
less than a second half. They are doing it very fast.

b115a9cf-0d8a-4b8f-b879-734bc25a1376-0
02:02:19.890 --> 02:02:25.147
Dharma just be a space of second and half between one kapalbhati

b115a9cf-0d8a-4b8f-b879-734bc25a1376-1
02:02:25.147 --> 02:02:26.280
and the other.

ea5085cc-7c72-4c8f-b2c7-b34ee38ccc1c-0
02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:30.582
If you do it very fast you will not be able to continue because

ea5085cc-7c72-4c8f-b2c7-b34ee38ccc1c-1
02:02:30.582 --> 02:02:33.452
it takes second and a half for the air to get back into the

ea5085cc-7c72-4c8f-b2c7-b34ee38ccc1c-2
02:02:33.452 --> 02:02:33.739

02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:36.640
So you do the kapalbhati like this.

9d879cf3-bfd7-4141-a14b-881cb7bb8f1a-0

02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:06.943
You should blow all the air out using your diaphragm like a

018df0c3-8cd6-4e42-a85f-8a65b418c455-1
02:03:06.943 --> 02:03:07.200

There is a tendency to strain the face while doing kapalbhati.

a93d1f42-57bb-463d-8e68-c845e533bf9d-0
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:38.460
The face should be relaxed throughout.

For some people, the Mudra is becoming loose after some time.

2ca18eb7-24ab-4fb3-b888-898e349da50d-0
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:08.260
Keep the Madras straight. Keep the arms straight all the time.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.021
Some people are engaging the next lock immediately after last

86f0cfcd-c5c5-47b9-a3ef-72937e21d1a3-1

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:18.370
When releasing the locks, do not relax everything at once.

055c71d1-cb0a-41fd-82f3-92705ebf78fe-0
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:33.410

02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:12.030
Now incorporating this corrections,

7e2fc148-4b6e-4488-a27d-4f493001e420-0
02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:19.280
You can complete the cycle.

9bc60804-23bd-41c6-9346-511c1efe7ee6-0
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:39.320


6731812a-8d31-40c4-8753-7e7b62aed588-0
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:42.190
Please rest.

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:24.990
Please set comfortably and open your eyes.

68fe9b5c-b810-43c8-b1a2-4c270f06e11b-0

02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:52.032
Now we will look at a few more common corrections along with

74c036af-6054-441a-8525-f6d6beb5aa7f-1
02:12:52.032 --> 02:12:52.850
the demonstration

6084a359-b8b5-4793-abb1-1327462cd7ca-0
02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:55.640
can sit in Ardha Sudarsana and observe

1f01b974-8e4e-42c8-b537-952431fa63de-0
02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:02.040
while doing the next clock.

f9bfd803-537f-4098-9930-3e5e10febfb2-0
02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:06.537
Some people are taking your head back and keeping it there for

f9bfd803-537f-4098-9930-3e5e10febfb2-1
02:13:06.537 --> 02:13:07.390
the long time.

e18d44c8-9f66-4d46-81c3-909b3cb672fd-0
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:20.230
The main aim of doing the next lock is to hold Kumbhaka.

ec10546a-0033-465b-aad7-e519f7244b6d-0
02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:22.930
If you keep your head back for a long time,

5ed3d508-23b4-43bf-bc9a-eb265119cfc8-0
02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:26.600
the time for which you hold
Kumbhaka will be reduced.

852c2ff7-fa98-4f2a-a846-6a0febe6f785-0
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.410
So you do the next lock like this.

2136ce42-3012-403b-a6bc-6749f0ddb607-0
02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:52.193
For some of you, talking in of the chin is not happening

2136ce42-3012-403b-a6bc-6749f0ddb607-1
02:13:52.193 --> 02:13:52.770
properly.

9a2f0b62-d500-400b-a7aa-d47dc2a962be-0
02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:08.050
Take your head back.

db1fd1df-d978-4796-8ca2-161fe38c6cad-0
02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:14.694
With the head still leaning back, pull your chin in tightly.

db1fd1df-d978-4796-8ca2-161fe38c6cad-1
02:14:14.694 --> 02:14:18.738
Once your chin is fully in, bring your head down and

db1fd1df-d978-4796-8ca2-161fe38c6cad-2
02:14:18.738 --> 02:14:22.020
forward, resting on the bit of the throat.

400dbbbb-720d-4f77-ac46-74d90f735c77-0
02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:40.840
There is a tendency to relax the poorna mudra as you exhale.

6c73ab3d-456f-4243-9e47-6219ee8653cf-0
02:14:54.610 --> 02:14:56.310
Exhale fully first,

ed5f6c8f-9a8e-4194-8811-ccde66649555-0
02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:02.340
then relax the Poonam Mitra.

378380b5-9583-4336-8e16-f7f577027e6e-0
02:15:11.250 --> 02:15:14.559
So the next crias we are going to learn. The next Kriya we are

378380b5-9583-4336-8e16-f7f577027e6e-1
02:15:14.559 --> 02:15:15.820
going to learn is called

d60a7c00-a7a8-4dd2-a942-8c7c15c0be56-0
02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:20.469
Swapnapriya. How to do
Swapnapriya will say that

d60a7c00-a7a8-4dd2-a942-8c7c15c0be56-1
02:15:20.469 --> 02:15:22.480
remonstration please upset.

f3acda66-f910-4e12-909c-283ebe0941f6-0
02:15:51.790 --> 02:16:02.520


0909a266-8f23-4428-9a18-03943f5c66d5-0
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:22.520


f7492000-da6a-4067-9ef4-350e61a6a34b-0
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:41.180
So what's being done is sitting in Vajrasana,

d0c3a6a7-aae7-4ac2-96f5-bee9307ded9c-0
02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:45.360
you place your palms on your waist, loosely placed.

8b06d7e2-beb1-4fd7-87d0-6146ef2be160-0
02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:47.360
Inhale fully,

325b7e35-5c7a-49ff-8a64-b805718b09b1-0
02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:51.830
open your mouth wide enough and stretch your tongue out fully.

d8b41273-5d36-408e-a71a-69070cd035d6-0
02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.820
If you stretch the tongue out fully

d771e06c-ff4e-4bd0-983f-56c5a3aa51c4-0
02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:59.928
you will notice attention in the uvula which is a tongue like

d771e06c-ff4e-4bd0-983f-56c5a3aa51c4-1
02:16:59.928 --> 02:17:04.116
thing hanging from the top. You must stretch it to your point

d771e06c-ff4e-4bd0-983f-56c5a3aa51c4-2
02:17:04.116 --> 02:17:08.507
where you notice tension in the uvula. Once you notice attention

d771e06c-ff4e-4bd0-983f-56c5a3aa51c4-3
02:17:08.507 --> 02:17:12.965
you do the dogs breath. If a dog comes running and stands here in

d771e06c-ff4e-4bd0-983f-56c5a3aa51c4-4
02:17:12.965 --> 02:17:15.330
front of you, how it would breathe

636263f5-2827-44c7-b216-f9212255184d-0
02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:21.760
just on the surface as rapidly as it is possible. So it is not

636263f5-2827-44c7-b216-f9212255184d-1
02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:23.440
like doing kapalbhati

2f4f50cb-8709-47db-b07b-25dbbaa8de25-0
02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:25.860
if you not come from the abdomen.

77bcfb71-b93f-4b20-8ee8-74b84ca63218-0
02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:31.188
It should be done as rapidly as it is possible, only on the

77bcfb71-b93f-4b20-8ee8-74b84ca63218-1
02:17:31.188 --> 02:17:35.700
surface. So if you can't do it that rapidly, you can start

77bcfb71-b93f-4b20-8ee8-74b84ca63218-2
02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:39.600
slowly and gradually increase the speed like this.

cebce430-e738-4ad2-a15c-28e3455bc78f-0
02:17:54.490 --> 02:17:58.870
So you do this 12 to 16 times, close your mouth

790edb71-bf63-4288-8f7f-b5be596f1bd4-0
02:17:59.650 --> 02:18:04.471
in helpfully and engaged the
Bandas Azido in Shambhavi. That

790edb71-bf63-4288-8f7f-b5be596f1bd4-1
02:18:04.471 --> 02:18:09.293
is, take your head back, the kitchen in, bring it down. Pull

790edb71-bf63-4288-8f7f-b5be596f1bd4-2
02:18:09.293 --> 02:18:11.270
the diaphragm muscles in.

409c49d9-d5f9-415e-9348-449bb63aa760-0
02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:13.530
Pull the enormous up.

46c8b046-24d5-40d8-b677-9ee0c02059c3-0
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:19.527
Stay here on fullness as long as it is comfortable for you. When

46c8b046-24d5-40d8-b677-9ee0c02059c3-1
02:18:19.527 --> 02:18:22.680
you feel like exhaling, bring your head up.

7748513d-f5b4-4639-873d-660b5cbb8184-0
02:18:23.410 --> 02:18:26.964
Excel to the nostrils, making the sound from the bit of the

7748513d-f5b4-4639-873d-660b5cbb8184-1
02:18:26.964 --> 02:18:27.320
throat

17fceff8-128c-4716-9838-7f661db9f24e-0
02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:33.048
after the exhalation is complete again. Take your head back. Take

17fceff8-128c-4716-9838-7f661db9f24e-1
02:18:33.048 --> 02:18:37.002
your chin. Bring it down. Lock it up on the emptiness. Stay

17fceff8-128c-4716-9838-7f661db9f24e-2
02:18:37.002 --> 02:18:41.284
here on emptiness as long as it is comfortable for you. When you

17fceff8-128c-4716-9838-7f661db9f24e-3
02:18:41.284 --> 02:18:44.250
feel like inhaling, bring your head head up.

7e4f33b9-44b7-47a0-a69a-9ebd019ae415-0
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.390
Inhale through the nostrils.

02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:49.920
After the installation is complete, you relax the

2f9eb98b-fd6f-4edf-b8a5-63c9d6e5e39f-0
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:54.297
date from lock and then you relax the inner lock. Now before

2f9eb98b-fd6f-4edf-b8a5-63c9d6e5e39f-1
02:18:54.297 --> 02:18:57.685
we do Swan Acharya, we will look at a few common corrections

2f9eb98b-fd6f-4edf-b8a5-63c9d6e5e39f-2
02:18:57.685 --> 02:19:00.240
along with the demonstration.
Please observe.

8071f77f-1a3e-451e-80f6-330ca16b03f8-0
02:19:05.250 --> 02:19:07.040
Do not keep your hands

75129df6-07d4-4c36-8582-48b68b1d98c8-0
02:19:07.770 --> 02:19:08.650
on your hips.

02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:18.330
Your hands should be on your waist, loosely placed.

8c5c6ccd-1044-4722-b53c-8c91dd0c4526-0
02:19:22.330 --> 02:19:24.650
Do not keep your shoulders forward

fb199d12-c319-44f7-853f-35dbd650f8fd-0
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:28.230
or backwood.

c871be66-9d4a-411c-ac9c-68e2c54fdfb6-0
02:19:33.010 --> 02:19:36.310
Your elbows should be in line with your shoulders.

9b716a77-0aa9-40e6-b2f1-0663b17a416a-0
02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:41.450
Some of you are stretching the tongue.

d9dcf855-932a-4ad0-ad06-179df656bf68-0
02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:45.090
Some of your are not stretching the tongue tongue out

02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:56.494
You must specify a tongue out fully to a point where you

97b6072f-025b-47b9-adb7-758fd9acb660-1
02:19:56.494 --> 02:19:58.270

02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:04.060
Some of you are doing it like
Kapalabhati.

b7ba48e8-2613-4598-9658-28bd3ae51153-0
02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:19.329
It is not like kapalbhati. It should be done as rapid as it is

b7ba48e8-2613-4598-9658-28bd3ae51153-1
02:20:19.329 --> 02:20:21.460

02:20:31.980 --> 02:20:35.633
There is a tendency to strain the face while doing Swan

9eadf477-ee45-4373-81fc-51418438624f-1

02:20:47.390 --> 02:20:50.260
The face should be relaxed throughout the kriya.

ae2ce852-1436-4e8a-ba26-8c6bc60da5db-0
02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:07.278

02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:30.270
Replace your palms

02:21:42.370 --> 02:21:45.270
Now you do the dogs breath 12 to
16 times.

02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:56.610

02:22:13.890 --> 02:22:16.752
When you exhale, you make the sound from the pit of the

You count at a comfortable pace.
You choose a certain pace and

02:35:23.722 --> 02:35:28.903
you stick to that. For example, you can count it like this

02:35:28.903 --> 02:35:34.259

152438cf-a13e-4352-b4d2-f12b2e020279-3
02:35:34.259 --> 02:35:37.070

02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:14.506
If 8 installments are little difficult for you to start with,

5ded4336-06c2-4a38-be2b-88f9d7e627fb-1
02:36:14.506 --> 02:36:19.032

02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:24.594
as the correction there is a tendency not to release chin

d74abb00-328a-48ec-bcca-0bf9f3eeb530-1
02:36:24.594 --> 02:36:28.616

02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:01.440

da4ccc73-9dfa-4365-9824-8f31d47d30fe-0
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:06.542
Middle lobe and upper loop. We first want to activate the lower

02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:20.090

3f3e4baa-890f-4ece-a8a7-84b2ce7212bf-1
02:40:29.008 --> 02:40:31.790

02:58:59.816 --> 02:59:02.749
Chalana Kriya properly, there is actually no need.

1df1eab3-0d7c-40e6-9738-8c900a6611df-0
02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:07.400
You know you will. You will notice where the prana is

1df1eab3-0d7c-40e6-9738-8c900a6611df-1
02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:10.305
getting directed if you do it properly, but for your

1df1eab3-0d7c-40e6-9738-8c900a6611df-2
02:59:10.305 --> 02:59:11.950
information we will repeat it.

40902972-f4c8-40be-b855-272dbdae79d4-0
02:59:13.380 --> 02:59:17.490
You can direct the prana to one side of the body by holding the

40902972-f4c8-40be-b855-272dbdae79d4-1
02:59:17.490 --> 02:59:21.664
mudra on that side alone. Let's say you want to direct the prana

40902972-f4c8-40be-b855-272dbdae79d4-2
02:59:21.664 --> 02:59:22.049
to the

ae0fb33a-925f-44f8-9c0e-fa2c4f08a772-0
02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:26.239
upper side of the body. So which mudra would you use if you want

ae0fb33a-925f-44f8-9c0e-fa2c4f08a772-1
02:59:26.239 --> 02:59:27.970
to direct the plan to the upper side,

3ce3d3f0-4e5f-4e57-9657-a68d8336434a-0
02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:32.987
upper portion of the body? Adi
Mudra if you want to direct the

3ce3d3f0-4e5f-4e57-9657-a68d8336434a-1
02:59:32.987 --> 02:59:34.290
prana to the right side

ad5f2be8-ca67-4a2f-806d-c81c3865036c-0
02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:36.930
in the upper upward direction,

1baa1c16-1821-4141-a4be-e7a4ec77db91-0
02:59:37.550 --> 02:59:39.750
you hold adi mudra on the right side

f7faabd5-2710-454a-8794-a68b97f44107-0
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:44.620
and you can do mudra kriya so that you will see that the prana

f7faabd5-2710-454a-8794-a68b97f44107-1
02:59:44.620 --> 02:59:48.319
is getting directed. As as I
said it is not like this is a

f7faabd5-2710-454a-8794-a68b97f44107-2
02:59:48.319 --> 02:59:52.269
knowledge. You have to do the kriya and experiment with it and

f7faabd5-2710-454a-8794-a68b97f44107-3
02:59:52.269 --> 02:59:54.839
see you. You have to experiment with it.

46ab47c7-ae1c-4224-974a-9dda5a98f06c-0
02:59:57.940 --> 03:00:01.755
Bhavna Namaskaram. Please explain Dauti again. OK, so I

46ab47c7-ae1c-4224-974a-9dda5a98f06c-1
03:00:01.755 --> 03:00:05.230
will review the instructions for
Dauti once again.

00ed47d9-6b9c-4fde-8e35-8aa0cf542e62-0
03:00:06.210 --> 03:00:07.800
How you do doubt is

fce8b5e4-d68a-4794-8cf2-27eaf3df7cb1-0
03:00:08.780 --> 03:00:11.240
you hold chin Mudra in your hands

f8fc80e5-046b-4210-bce5-54f9f46afc44-0
03:00:12.180 --> 03:00:16.896
with the tip of your tongue. You touch yellow teeth and make the

f8fc80e5-046b-4210-bce5-54f9f46afc44-1
03:00:16.896 --> 03:00:17.550
sound sh.

612b6862-3f02-44d5-a8b6-a3a92f89439d-0
03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:21.790
Making the sound, you expel the air forcefully,

9350875e-e2e9-44f2-acca-f776abb7ab13-0
03:00:22.600 --> 03:00:26.128
Ben forward and reach your knees. By the time you reach

9350875e-e2e9-44f2-acca-f776abb7ab13-1
03:00:26.128 --> 03:00:29.720
your knees, you must be completely empty of your breath.

4eea0bed-874a-478e-a668-b829a59d120a-0
03:00:31.170 --> 03:00:31.940
Tokyo head in

37f5e104-4e7e-48ba-a219-63c99658c044-0
03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:36.869
so that stuck your head in and stay there for 3 to 4 seconds.

37f5e104-4e7e-48ba-a219-63c99658c044-1
03:00:36.869 --> 03:00:38.110
In total emptiness,

d9f149dd-aeeb-481c-99cf-f000f7c89044-0
03:00:39.540 --> 03:00:41.190
come up about 1/3 of the way,

42e1ca53-902f-4ea5-94db-0b673bc7b60c-0
03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:44.080
then start the inhalation and come up.

0c430f1c-1807-4a3b-9296-0a42f6ce71be-0
03:00:48.690 --> 03:00:51.970
Srikanth, please go over
Nagariya. Count once again.

a6a4d6e0-4e4a-478d-b409-5191437858ac-0
03:00:53.070 --> 03:00:53.530
Okay.

142bcdff-0d56-4248-8d38-7960ddd629eb-0
03:00:54.920 --> 03:00:56.930
So how you do Nagariya is

ad8cfa07-5762-485e-b70f-8a932a3d4737-0
03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:01.060
you hold Chin Mudra in your hands,

13c45a82-f8bc-4497-8a5d-ca6325c8876d-0
03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:04.560
You inhale in installments.

118bcf81-2253-4cc2-b7b7-5a55784a0133-0
03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:06.870
Inhaler bit.

0244a517-9f0a-49f8-a35e-b41e390ec5a0-0
03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:10.050
Hold count 129.

23f75df8-38cb-4ec7-a2ec-918750d48073-0
03:01:11.490 --> 03:01:12.510
Inhale a bit more.

1d05a0f7-b295-4206-8ad6-64c1c883830d-0
03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.190
Count one to 9

422e51c1-0bfe-416e-9017-2dc3b77abe61-0
03:01:16.460 --> 03:01:19.720
like this. You inhale in 8
installments

5af69392-ae34-48d1-85ee-0e46b98fd00d-0
03:01:20.570 --> 03:01:21.490
with a space off

afda561c-c1f5-4404-b4fa-fa207a1b6991-0
03:01:22.230 --> 03:01:24.680
9 counts between each installment.

d3a5a8df-5593-4a5b-84bc-3a99f5f9536d-0
03:01:26.460 --> 03:01:29.060
At the end for the last installment,

306aecd1-447e-4c2f-94a3-1e9f2c27a2ba-0
03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:31.120
inhale fully

bee5acf1-22b5-4834-9ca6-21a14ba3076c-0
03:01:32.290 --> 03:01:33.310
count 129

32523356-9eee-45de-9165-ca84edadd137-0
03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:36.940
release Chin Mudra in both the hands.

9d2d230d-d0e5-43f5-8d16-22cfc66e1f6a-0
03:01:38.280 --> 03:01:40.540
Close the right nostril with the right thumb

6b98fe4e-41f1-4cbf-8aba-facf3a1ecb87-0
03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:45.075
exiled to the left nostril with the sound from the pit of the

6b98fe4e-41f1-4cbf-8aba-facf3a1ecb87-1
03:01:45.075 --> 03:01:45.430
throat.

7f3f7ba3-4ee6-4511-bef0-4e4dbe0e666f-0
03:01:48.730 --> 03:01:52.900
Namaskaram vasu ya question for
Pancha Sahakriya. Do we take a

7f3f7ba3-4ee6-4511-bef0-4e4dbe0e666f-1
03:01:52.900 --> 03:01:55.350
break in between organs and do it as

5376ca0d-244a-4845-b64d-5960c194adea-0
03:01:56.120 --> 03:02:00.427
especially transitioning from stomach, kidney inhaling for 16

5376ca0d-244a-4845-b64d-5960c194adea-1
03:02:00.427 --> 03:02:01.470
is a bit tough.

e3f2f42b-da5e-4961-a769-5ff9790009e8-0
03:02:03.830 --> 03:02:08.360
So for panchayat Kriya, initially if you have

c2ecda67-c4da-412c-840b-961ea856a09c-0
03:02:08.970 --> 03:02:12.936
if you have started, if you are doing the kriya regularly by

c2ecda67-c4da-412c-840b-961ea856a09c-1
03:02:12.936 --> 03:02:17.097
now, if it is more than 6 months by now it would have fallen in

c2ecda67-c4da-412c-840b-961ea856a09c-2
03:02:17.097 --> 03:02:21.258
place. But still if you find it difficult to do Punchi thakeria

c2ecda67-c4da-412c-840b-961ea856a09c-3
03:02:21.258 --> 03:02:25.029
in a flow, it's OK to take a break in between the organs.

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-0
03:02:26.130 --> 03:02:29.264
So when you are transitioning from one organ to another, you

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-1
03:02:29.264 --> 03:02:32.552
directly transition. There is no an extra breath inhalation and

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-2
03:02:32.552 --> 03:02:35.532
exhalation in between it should be a flow. But if you are

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-3
03:02:35.532 --> 03:02:38.821
finding it difficult, if you are gasping for the breath, if you

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-4
03:02:38.821 --> 03:02:41.441
are not able to do it continuously, it's OK to get

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-5
03:02:41.441 --> 03:02:44.524
your breath into normal before you transition into the next

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-6
03:02:44.524 --> 03:02:47.659
organ. So you just change the mudra and your transition into

daab59d9-7b9b-4972-9ad3-1cd7a4c5cf5b-7
03:02:47.659 --> 03:02:48.430
the next organ.

ab9d9648-1204-47eb-b622-c267ddf669f4-0
03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:55.091
Can you please explain
Swarnakala once again? Okay

ab9d9648-1204-47eb-b622-c267ddf669f4-1
03:02:55.091 --> 03:02:56.260
namaskaram, Vinod.

716fbccd-20b1-4c14-bc2e-1ffd521c6dea-0
03:02:57.090 --> 03:02:58.950
So how you do Swanik raise

e02e892f-7318-4132-a75f-92dbea897d34-0
03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:01.330
sitting in Vajrasana?

1dc1a3b5-590c-45a9-a2d3-f3f46a9b089c-0
03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:04.660
You place your palms on your waist,

a668c63c-e46d-44a8-8ece-77d9da327fb7-0
03:03:05.630 --> 03:03:06.710
loosely placed.

4238a6a9-a2e7-4493-8a53-ef84134b85e4-0
03:03:07.730 --> 03:03:09.030
You inhale fully,

ef70c847-e7bb-4bc4-a7c1-b9946265c5a9-0
03:03:10.270 --> 03:03:12.160
stretch your tongue out fully.

6df16927-2b11-4881-bb40-5fc1553ec310-0
03:03:13.940 --> 03:03:17.664
Once the tongue is stretched fully out, you do the dogs

6df16927-2b11-4881-bb40-5fc1553ec310-1
03:03:17.664 --> 03:03:18.130
breath.

fea4a6a9-0612-4580-b7c8-45a114c70f29-0
03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:24.036
So if a dog comes, comes running and stands here in front of you,

fea4a6a9-0612-4580-b7c8-45a114c70f29-1
03:03:24.036 --> 03:03:27.888
how it would breathe just on the surface, as rapid as it is

fea4a6a9-0612-4580-b7c8-45a114c70f29-2
03:03:27.888 --> 03:03:28.980
possible for you.

0d3f8130-e937-4f61-b4c5-3326a39d9bef-0
03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:34.070
So you should not come from the abdomen. It is not like doing

0d3f8130-e937-4f61-b4c5-3326a39d9bef-1
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:38.673
kapalbhati. It should be done as rapid as it is possible for you

0d3f8130-e937-4f61-b4c5-3326a39d9bef-2
03:03:38.673 --> 03:03:40.089
only on the surface.

b8114d55-e6f1-435c-8ab1-a509aba664b7-0
03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:43.700
You do this 12 to 16 times,

e03e407f-737b-40bd-8ae0-3ee71dc5939e-0
03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:45.870
then close your mouth.

26b717d6-caee-4b75-915d-333023021761-0
03:03:47.070 --> 03:03:47.970
Inhale fully

1cc82f99-666a-49e3-814b-2cd3c504e641-0
03:03:48.910 --> 03:03:53.600
and you engage the bandas as you do in Shambhavi. When you exhale

fb675e8b-b1f7-456d-aedf-2e698a9e6faa-0
03:03:54.370 --> 03:03:56.550
you make the sound from the bit of the throat.

88db622d-bd54-4dd1-a8c8-ebb55c880bac-0
03:03:59.620 --> 03:04:04.163
Namaskaram karthik. How many cycles of math prakriya needs to

88db622d-bd54-4dd1-a8c8-ebb55c880bac-1
03:04:04.163 --> 03:04:04.750
be done?

9e7edcfd-7676-4199-ad85-048cdaf3c0b6-0
03:04:06.290 --> 03:04:10.317
So today if you remember you have done 3 cycles of Madhyamik,

9e7edcfd-7676-4199-ad85-048cdaf3c0b6-1
03:04:10.317 --> 03:04:13.240
resent it so it is 3 cycles of math Prakriya

cb7cec6b-f1a7-4e4f-aec3-784f2e2fc252-0
03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:16.740
Saravanan, Namaskaram

704dc9d8-598c-4f8c-878d-da11e023a45a-0
03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:21.329
in Swana, Kakariya. Should the hands be taken off the waste

704dc9d8-598c-4f8c-878d-da11e023a45a-1
03:04:21.329 --> 03:04:25.080
before releasing the analogue, or should the log be released

704dc9d8-598c-4f8c-878d-da11e023a45a-2
03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:27.540
first, followed by taking of the hands?

a8ea8e8c-c2b4-4dc4-8169-04fca0371ba0-0
03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:32.511
So there is no such instruction as such, but you can first

a8ea8e8c-c2b4-4dc4-8169-04fca0371ba0-1
03:04:32.511 --> 03:04:35.130
release the logs and then relax your hands.

26ff0f06-26fb-4c53-9ac8-593f778cadd0-0

Namaskaram Rituparn

8fba30fd-6f23-4eeb-9d59-da2d958bd09b-0
03:04:40.540 --> 03:04:43.909
sound in Kapalabhati is not coming perfectly. What should I

8fba30fd-6f23-4eeb-9d59-da2d958bd09b-1
03:04:43.909 --> 03:04:47.447
be doing wrong? Am I making the construction on the pit of the

8fba30fd-6f23-4eeb-9d59-da2d958bd09b-2
03:04:47.447 --> 03:04:48.290
throat as well?

cbfbeeab-7cc3-4370-aefb-0e32fdef48be-0
03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:53.215
So thats why we are conducting sessions like this so that you

cbfbeeab-7cc3-4370-aefb-0e32fdef48be-1
03:04:53.215 --> 03:04:56.747
can check your practice and correct your practice. So now

cbfbeeab-7cc3-4370-aefb-0e32fdef48be-2
03:04:56.747 --> 03:05:00.219
that are the instructions clear to you? Rituparn, if the

cbfbeeab-7cc3-4370-aefb-0e32fdef48be-3
03:05:00.219 --> 03:05:03.872
instructions for math prakriya is clear to you that you use

cbfbeeab-7cc3-4370-aefb-0e32fdef48be-4
03:05:03.872 --> 03:05:07.709
your diaphragm like a pump and you make the sound from the bit

cbfbeeab-7cc3-4370-aefb-0e32fdef48be-5
03:05:07.709 --> 03:05:11.485
of the throat. So the whatever the sound is possible for you,

cbfbeeab-7cc3-4370-aefb-0e32fdef48be-6
03:05:11.485 --> 03:05:15.200
you make that sound. You don't try to imitate somebody or to

f1d23c1d-560e-449e-96f3-ef3629cdf47c-0
03:05:16.390 --> 03:05:19.524
to get the sound like how you have seen in the demo. It might

f1d23c1d-560e-449e-96f3-ef3629cdf47c-1
03:05:19.524 --> 03:05:22.658
take some time. You can slowly work towards it, but right now

f1d23c1d-560e-449e-96f3-ef3629cdf47c-2
03:05:22.658 --> 03:05:25.741
from the pit of the throat. If you don't still get the sound

f1d23c1d-560e-449e-96f3-ef3629cdf47c-3
03:05:25.741 --> 03:05:28.977
from the pit of the throat, you do it with your mouth open like

f1d23c1d-560e-449e-96f3-ef3629cdf47c-4
03:05:28.977 --> 03:05:29.229
this.

40adf5aa-7250-4b32-ad04-8a91eb4c139a-0
03:05:30.100 --> 03:05:32.910
So first start with your mouth open like this.

e4a89234-d5f1-4336-83e5-03c8c5a865ab-0
03:05:36.680 --> 03:05:40.020
If still many of you have the same question, you can please

e4a89234-d5f1-4336-83e5-03c8c5a865ab-1
03:05:40.020 --> 03:05:41.190
try it along with me.

282c7b14-7d30-4643-a384-f6d4828fbdb0-0
03:05:42.680 --> 03:05:43.340
Hi

1300dc97-ef06-4043-85e1-5210b4dbc62b-0
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:48.240
hi.

31528ea0-20fe-491f-9b22-668dddc02a95-0
03:05:55.680 --> 03:05:57.500
The same sound with a blow.

aa5d39e6-f3be-41be-bed1-10dcb62c43fd-0
03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:06.660
Same thing with the mouth closed.

21274be4-9779-469b-a5d9-a3d2428c4e44-0
03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:24.078
Whenever you see that the sound is coming off, the bit of the

21274be4-9779-469b-a5d9-a3d2428c4e44-1
03:06:24.078 --> 03:06:27.957
throat sound is not coming from the pit of the throat. You open

21274be4-9779-469b-a5d9-a3d2428c4e44-2
03:06:27.957 --> 03:06:31.472
your mouth, make the sound, close your mouth and continue

21274be4-9779-469b-a5d9-a3d2428c4e44-3
03:06:31.472 --> 03:06:35.291
doing it. So while doing Mahati
Prakriya, whenever you see the

21274be4-9779-469b-a5d9-a3d2428c4e44-4
03:06:35.291 --> 03:06:39.110
sound is not coming properly, open your mouth, make the sound,

2aa10715-b9fd-4f98-9332-459981792229-0
03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:41.780
close your mouth and continue doing it.

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-0
03:06:44.810 --> 03:06:48.310
Namaskaram hiral During mensuration if I get bleeding

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-1
03:06:48.310 --> 03:06:52.265
for 6 to 7 days, can I do math prakriya after 4 days or do I

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-2
03:06:52.265 --> 03:06:56.219
need to wait for bleeding to stop completely. So you have to

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-3
03:06:56.219 --> 03:07:00.303
wait till it stops completely till your periods are over. Only

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-4
03:07:00.303 --> 03:07:04.322
once your periods are over you can continue with kapalabhati.

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-5
03:07:04.322 --> 03:07:08.406
Until then you do the variation.
That is you hold poorna mudra

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-6
03:07:08.406 --> 03:07:12.231
and do 7 cycles or 4 to 5
duration remembering 4 points to

bbfabefa-5a9f-4f66-a710-162d75489693-7
03:07:12.231 --> 03:07:12.880
breathing.

4f12cb89-3cab-41ff-9196-390391488366-0
03:07:15.580 --> 03:07:17.340
Richa Sharma, Namaskaram

c3c03214-9cb5-4170-bf2e-eff868f72e06-0
03:07:18.030 --> 03:07:20.874
please can you tell the variation for periods and

c3c03214-9cb5-4170-bf2e-eff868f72e06-1
03:07:20.874 --> 03:07:24.060
travelling please. So I just repeat it for the periods.

4c82ffd6-b3a7-4e45-84a5-514327371c7e-0
03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:31.027
So you instead of Kapalbhati holding Purna mudra breath with

4c82ffd6-b3a7-4e45-84a5-514327371c7e-1
03:07:31.027 --> 03:07:36.119
764 to 5 to ratio 4 points to breathing 7 cycles, now I

4c82ffd6-b3a7-4e45-84a5-514327371c7e-2
03:07:36.119 --> 03:07:37.120
travelling.

a5af4f8e-c0e6-4022-b008-2db4302be3b2-0
03:07:37.890 --> 03:07:41.436
If you are able to sit in
Vajrasana you can always do the

a5af4f8e-c0e6-4022-b008-2db4302be3b2-1
03:07:41.436 --> 03:07:45.350
full check the chanakya. As many of us, many of the volunteers,

a5af4f8e-c0e6-4022-b008-2db4302be3b2-2
03:07:45.350 --> 03:07:48.774
they keep travelling but we still ensure that we do our

a5af4f8e-c0e6-4022-b008-2db4302be3b2-3
03:07:48.774 --> 03:07:49.080
Kriya

e206d71e-bcef-49c4-a80e-ad9373b2bdfb-0
03:07:49.780 --> 03:07:53.747
on a daily basis. But on certain cases, like if you are

e206d71e-bcef-49c4-a80e-ad9373b2bdfb-1
03:07:53.747 --> 03:07:58.139
travelling by bus or plane for days together, where you can't

e206d71e-bcef-49c4-a80e-ad9373b2bdfb-2
03:07:58.139 --> 03:07:59.840
sit in Vajrasana at all.

5a8fc063-7dac-442a-be6b-b017f8ddc7ca-0
03:08:00.720 --> 03:08:04.570
Only in that cases you can sit on the chair.

5746db89-f792-468f-87c8-7bf2c05143a9-0
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:07.280
You remove your footwear, Socks,

1f27af67-aee7-4f12-943c-c191046f7501-0
03:08:08.020 --> 03:08:09.310
keep your big toes touching,

ed6fb484-8914-47d6-b186-ed8831b2461e-0
03:08:10.240 --> 03:08:14.320
keep your back rested, head straight. You cannot do full

ed6fb484-8914-47d6-b186-ed8831b2461e-1
03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:17.900
Shakti Chalana Kriya. You can only do naadapriya,

8d075fc0-78da-4953-851e-38b36291b7c2-0
03:08:18.610 --> 03:08:19.360
no doubt.

4a6cd749-d20d-48f8-8fc2-19e03cb77f06-0
03:08:20.620 --> 03:08:21.380
Mudra Kriya

e6fcbb54-2cef-44b0-9ad6-92ae02329ada-0
03:08:22.450 --> 03:08:25.290
only deep breathing No 4 to 5 to ratio

b1d9af6b-9eb7-40fc-903e-2f5dcb9d2465-0
03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:30.945
sukriya and panchayat kriya. In other words, you're not doing

b1d9af6b-9eb7-40fc-903e-2f5dcb9d2465-1
03:08:30.945 --> 03:08:34.870
any part of the Kriya which involves Kumbhaka Shunyakal

4ca8b197-253e-4f0f-a805-2cc674c2853e-0
03:08:36.140 --> 03:08:40.258
but doing the Kriya like this.
70% of the benefit may be lost.

4ca8b197-253e-4f0f-a805-2cc674c2853e-1
03:08:40.258 --> 03:08:44.049
So as much as possible just see if you are able to sit in

4ca8b197-253e-4f0f-a805-2cc674c2853e-2
03:08:44.049 --> 03:08:46.730
Vajrasana and do full check the
Chanakya

dc037a87-761a-44c3-b569-29c93cdd522c-0
03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:53.790
namaskaram nishanth.

9a63fb2a-3d74-452c-b29d-a30678e00d6f-0
03:08:54.920 --> 03:08:58.715
What should we do instead of mark prakriya if you are not

9a63fb2a-3d74-452c-b29d-a30678e00d6f-1
03:08:58.715 --> 03:09:02.446
doing math prakriya. So if you have any conditions, as I

9a63fb2a-3d74-452c-b29d-a30678e00d6f-2
03:09:02.446 --> 03:09:05.914
mentioned before, any physical conditions, you avoid

9a63fb2a-3d74-452c-b29d-a30678e00d6f-3
03:09:05.914 --> 03:09:06.700
kapalabhati.

954d73f7-8e40-4d97-a2cd-d16dc471236f-0
03:09:07.500 --> 03:09:10.590
Instead of kapalbhati you hold poorna mudra

d0f2e2ff-8e17-4090-9cfc-9f286bd284f4-0
03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:15.768
and you do 7 cycles of 4 to 5 to ratio remembering 4 points to

d0f2e2ff-8e17-4090-9cfc-9f286bd284f4-1
03:09:15.768 --> 03:09:19.260
breathing and one doubt. I just avoid kapalbhati

2c14617b-0521-44bd-bf6d-1c265d8e2c06-0
03:09:21.730 --> 03:09:23.060
Namaskaram Suresh.

0ec6eef3-74c9-488d-897c-d21268c74db3-0
03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:28.217
I underwent surgery for hernia 7
years back. Can I do math?

0ec6eef3-74c9-488d-897c-d21268c74db3-1
03:09:28.217 --> 03:09:29.900
Prakriya, please don't.

fb633053-5092-4435-bcfc-66c0efb158fb-0
03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:34.652
So you do the variation that we just mentioned. Now don't do

fb633053-5092-4435-bcfc-66c0efb158fb-1
03:09:34.652 --> 03:09:35.320
kapalbhati

9df337e8-ff9c-421b-a809-7baf5446e2a0-0
03:09:37.390 --> 03:09:41.636
namaskaram shahrukh. Should we do bandas after every cycle of

9df337e8-ff9c-421b-a809-7baf5446e2a0-1
03:09:41.636 --> 03:09:42.390
Kapalbhati?

395df334-f7a0-4795-8d6a-5b11deb9ea54-0
03:09:43.490 --> 03:09:47.188
Do you remember did we do bandas after every cycle of Kapalbhati

395df334-f7a0-4795-8d6a-5b11deb9ea54-1
03:09:47.188 --> 03:09:47.530
today?

b0b8a733-23e6-4b83-acdf-3c1bbc6b8c64-0
03:09:49.420 --> 03:09:49.910
Yes.

47709645-901c-49ba-b6c2-c8dc8dc2d713-0
03:09:50.980 --> 03:09:56.280
So one cycle of math. Prakriya means kapalabhati and bandas

a1bf5511-d1de-47e0-8d25-2fc1d1dbe0fb-0
03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:01.400
you can do 15 to 20. So here as a time constraint we will ask

a1bf5511-d1de-47e0-8d25-2fc1d1dbe0fb-1
03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:05.196
you to do only 15 to 20
kapalabhati. But if you have

a1bf5511-d1de-47e0-8d25-2fc1d1dbe0fb-2
03:10:05.196 --> 03:10:09.422
have been practicing it for long, so we suggest like there

a1bf5511-d1de-47e0-8d25-2fc1d1dbe0fb-3
03:10:09.422 --> 03:10:13.433
should be a minimum of 50
kapalabhati per second cycle,

a1bf5511-d1de-47e0-8d25-2fc1d1dbe0fb-4
03:10:13.433 --> 03:10:17.945
minimum 50 kapalbhati per cycle and you can gradually increase

a1bf5511-d1de-47e0-8d25-2fc1d1dbe0fb-5
03:10:17.945 --> 03:10:21.240
the number of kapalbhati as per your comfort.

c234fa13-15a7-4ff8-920e-cbd1bbddd3f6-0
03:10:22.420 --> 03:10:25.907
A number of kapalbhati per its saikil need not be equal. You

c234fa13-15a7-4ff8-920e-cbd1bbddd3f6-1
03:10:25.907 --> 03:10:29.281
can do as many kapalabhati as you are comfortable with for

c234fa13-15a7-4ff8-920e-cbd1bbddd3f6-2
03:10:29.281 --> 03:10:29.910
each cycle.

76c0e4d3-d9a4-43af-ae6a-2f17a6e0e98a-0
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:36.040
So kapalbhati and bandas means one cycle of math prakriya.

fb3fc54c-46b9-4eb8-91c9-36c84ca60af4-0
03:10:36.760 --> 03:10:39.700
Like this you will do 3 cycles of math. Prakriya

95db5beb-7605-4dee-b8f7-dc02dea62892-0
03:10:42.800 --> 03:10:45.822
how many kapalabhati should we do need cycle. It is just

95db5beb-7605-4dee-b8f7-dc02dea62892-1
03:10:45.822 --> 03:10:46.300
answered.

300ce580-3d90-456f-8f16-c7106ef10128-0
03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:54.270
So do we need to exhale fully within the 4 counts for kidney

ce20f8c7-5c77-491c-9b38-fcf19c792f2d-0
03:10:55.050 --> 03:10:58.620
because unable to excel fully within 4 counts?

b6082034-81a6-449b-be3b-6eac8beea25a-0
03:10:59.340 --> 03:11:04.034
What to do occur? Namaskaram Sai
Balaji so in I hope this

b6082034-81a6-449b-be3b-6eac8beea25a-1
03:11:04.034 --> 03:11:07.110
question is about for Pancha
Sahitya.

d157f187-7e67-415a-bc53-78cdabef5e16-0
03:11:09.440 --> 03:11:13.933
Yeah so the count for the punches Saikia is 16844. So in

d157f187-7e67-415a-bc53-78cdabef5e16-1
03:11:13.933 --> 03:11:18.427
panchayat area it is never a full acceleration or a full

d157f187-7e67-415a-bc53-78cdabef5e16-2
03:11:18.427 --> 03:11:22.290
inhalation. Your breathing only as per the count

08bdf5b2-c2e8-4fb3-ab7f-fa01bd229c6b-0
03:11:22.940 --> 03:11:27.543
okay. So you are not exhaling fully. You exhale for the count

08bdf5b2-c2e8-4fb3-ab7f-fa01bd229c6b-1
03:11:27.543 --> 03:11:32.294
of 4 and after that you stop it and then you go with the second

08bdf5b2-c2e8-4fb3-ab7f-fa01bd229c6b-2
03:11:32.294 --> 03:11:32.740
cycle.

d8a38583-b698-44fd-95aa-e46ca1b807ea-0
03:11:33.750 --> 03:11:35.440
Okay. Hope this answers your question.

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-0
03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:42.830
So to in order to add this, some of you have mentioned that you

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-1
03:11:42.830 --> 03:11:46.924
are not able to inhale or exhale for the count of 16. It is that

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-2
03:11:46.924 --> 03:11:50.828
was only because right now your lung capacity is still not to

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-3
03:11:50.828 --> 03:11:54.859
that point where you are able to exhale or inhale for the count

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-4
03:11:54.859 --> 03:11:58.889
of 16. So if you are practicing
Shakti Chalana Kriya regularly,

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-5
03:11:58.889 --> 03:12:02.794
you will be able to see that your lung capacity increases and

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-6
03:12:02.794 --> 03:12:06.698
you are able to inhale or exhale for the count of 16. But for

c8ded4fe-fffa-4025-ac0a-59a15c517edf-7
03:12:06.698 --> 03:12:08.839
now, if you are not able to do it

70b6b916-da4d-461b-9d34-262a19ceaa21-0
03:12:08.910 --> 03:12:10.920
as per the account, you still keep the count.

f2ea94e4-4cef-478a-8f65-8258ac9bbb37-0
03:12:12.100 --> 03:12:14.147
You still keep the account and you will see that you will be

f2ea94e4-4cef-478a-8f65-8258ac9bbb37-1
03:12:14.147 --> 03:12:15.390
able to do it over a period of time.

7a0451e5-949f-4191-ac1e-dbe121760173-0
03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:18.680
Namaskaar Amiga

700a45a3-913f-403d-b92c-22839e98d127-0
03:12:20.820 --> 03:12:25.619
in Mudra kriya switching to next mudra. Is it continuous process

700a45a3-913f-403d-b92c-22839e98d127-1
03:12:25.619 --> 03:12:29.680
doing going to the next mudra?
Yes. So in Mudra Kriya,

3ddce598-dac0-431a-b4ff-12852bd2e512-0
03:12:30.510 --> 03:12:33.781
it's a flow. It's a continuous process from one mudra to

3ddce598-dac0-431a-b4ff-12852bd2e512-1
03:12:33.781 --> 03:12:36.765
another. You just simply transition by changing the

3ddce598-dac0-431a-b4ff-12852bd2e512-2
03:12:36.765 --> 03:12:37.109
mudra.

14a71e2b-c3e1-418e-9ed9-94c8106fdcd2-0
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:42.475
Can we restart Shunya as well along with Shakti, Chalana,

14a71e2b-c3e1-418e-9ed9-94c8106fdcd2-1
03:12:42.475 --> 03:12:44.710
Kriya? What are the 4 conditions for Shunya

9e5060e0-939f-43dd-9d9d-75fcf781e35f-0
03:12:46.160 --> 03:12:50.766
Namaskaram, Amit? So in case if anybody else also have the same

9e5060e0-939f-43dd-9d9d-75fcf781e35f-1
03:12:50.766 --> 03:12:55.157
question, the 4 conditions for
Shunya please focus. So the 4

9e5060e0-939f-43dd-9d9d-75fcf781e35f-2
03:12:55.157 --> 03:12:59.692
conditions for union, the first
2 conditions are physical, the

9e5060e0-939f-43dd-9d9d-75fcf781e35f-3
03:12:59.692 --> 03:13:01.780
next 2 conditions are mental.

288cc4d4-bedc-4c8b-83a5-be144f1188a3-0
03:13:02.530 --> 03:13:04.670
So the first 2 physical conditions are

8234e7b7-0d24-4926-a44f-a30cea0f900a-0
03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:08.690
somewhat hungry, somewhat tired,

d1ab4bad-aec9-44af-9a51-8fd63c47bdde-0
03:13:10.770 --> 03:13:12.120
no expectations,

c679bb2e-9d22-4153-a54a-91ecc97cba16-0
03:13:13.850 --> 03:13:17.800
no reactions to the external or internal situations.

d35a6d5a-5a7e-4dbe-b017-1b3b868761cc-0
03:13:20.350 --> 03:13:23.021
Can you please review the
Kumbhaka and Shunya for the

d35a6d5a-5a7e-4dbe-b017-1b3b868761cc-1
03:13:23.021 --> 03:13:26.285
different prayas? Do we make the sound while inhaling as well? In

d35a6d5a-5a7e-4dbe-b017-1b3b868761cc-2
03:13:26.285 --> 03:13:26.829
Mudra Kriya

a796dbdb-55db-4ef6-a4c9-b6bcb360a2c2-0
03:13:28.290 --> 03:13:29.820
when are the Davis.

5ed8d89d-cc2e-44e5-93ee-b6076316ec25-0
03:13:31.430 --> 03:13:35.856
So hope this question should have answered after doing this

5ed8d89d-cc2e-44e5-93ee-b6076316ec25-1
03:13:35.856 --> 03:13:37.480
kriya today. But still

3b5f07ce-f845-48ad-9cd0-2f4ef6526452-0
03:13:38.670 --> 03:13:42.908
so when you are inhaling you are not making the sound. OK so you

3b5f07ce-f845-48ad-9cd0-2f4ef6526452-1
03:13:42.908 --> 03:13:47.017
are holding only when you are exhaling and check the chanakya.

3b5f07ce-f845-48ad-9cd0-2f4ef6526452-2
03:13:47.017 --> 03:13:50.930
Whenever you exhale, you make the sound from the pit of the

3b5f07ce-f845-48ad-9cd0-2f4ef6526452-3
03:13:50.930 --> 03:13:52.430
throat. Except Sukriya.

78ecdae2-5c0a-4852-8fa0-721859f62cf4-0
03:13:53.140 --> 03:13:55.470
When inhaling, you are not making the sound

83c7855f-dc06-4381-afc8-7a119f6769bf-0
03:13:56.980 --> 03:14:00.996
so you are holding Kumbhaka and shunya ka only in Mahati,

83c7855f-dc06-4381-afc8-7a119f6769bf-1
03:14:00.996 --> 03:14:01.620
Prakriya,

7f0a75e4-5a6f-4bb7-a327-f224301e8602-0
03:14:02.370 --> 03:14:04.230
Swana and Kakariya.

0831f46b-eea9-462e-908b-bf09c71e5953-0
03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:10.290
In Marathi Prakriya, you engaged the bandas only on Kumbhaka

d63d2a72-6695-4c60-9478-0054f02df00c-0
03:14:11.370 --> 03:14:14.880
in Swana and Kakariya. You are engaging the bandas

1d9a2743-533a-4a84-a073-50e0f7a00fc1-0
03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:18.070
both in Kumbhaka and Shunyakal

cc78abac-2c0a-4942-985d-b461d366920e-0
03:14:19.730 --> 03:14:23.782
and doubt is you want me to review the sequence once again.

cc78abac-2c0a-4942-985d-b461d366920e-1
03:14:23.782 --> 03:14:27.700
So the whole Shakti Chakra is like this. There are 5 sets

dc3aef05-e2ce-421d-a472-af6a90421670-0
03:14:28.690 --> 03:14:30.560
now. The Kriya Dauti

45731fe2-f630-4f95-9e9d-7de43aaf222d-0
03:14:31.950 --> 03:14:33.700
Mudra Kriya Dauti

6c9c9e63-e28e-4b6b-93b3-8c5606e415e4-0
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:38.520
Sukriya Mahati Prakriya Dauti

aa1bf21b-5e8e-47a1-8a59-15f1db3c4f53-0
03:14:39.690 --> 03:14:42.880
Swana Kaka Nagariya Dauti

a0d54f20-0af9-4768-a022-3025114c2670-0
03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:46.080
Panchasara Takraya Date.

b37dc194-6fcd-40cb-a7f1-0f64f1babf7b-0
03:14:48.840 --> 03:14:52.070
How can we extend the practice time? How long can we extend it

f229f8c7-b248-4232-bb37-01364b8a8dce-0
03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:54.320
so

428fcc26-eee0-4ea0-85d8-a7236b471475-0
03:14:55.220 --> 03:14:58.560
the duration of Shakti Chalana
Kriya can be increased

b3ebb7aa-e0d0-4406-ae5a-6fa77496e926-0
03:14:59.780 --> 03:15:02.963
as you keep practicing it over a period of time. You will see

b3ebb7aa-e0d0-4406-ae5a-6fa77496e926-1
03:15:02.963 --> 03:15:06.147
that once you are practicing it regularly, your lung capacity

b3ebb7aa-e0d0-4406-ae5a-6fa77496e926-2
03:15:06.147 --> 03:15:06.610
increases

8d7ce58d-075e-40a4-8f48-bfeb84ccb6e2-0
03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:11.270
which results in your breath being slow and full.

bed9314a-5e33-4628-8d0c-285fc9093887-0
03:15:12.340 --> 03:15:14.720
And also if you are doing more kapalabhati

987c11e3-1937-44a4-a95a-145d8106c9db-0
03:15:16.200 --> 03:15:19.463
this will result in extending the duration of check the

987c11e3-1937-44a4-a95a-145d8106c9db-1
03:15:19.463 --> 03:15:23.192
chakria. So your lung capacity and number of Kapalbhati you are

987c11e3-1937-44a4-a95a-145d8106c9db-2
03:15:23.192 --> 03:15:26.630
you are doing the Shakti Chalana
Kriya might increase from

8102e043-7c21-4344-abdf-9bf533d95020-0
03:15:27.460 --> 03:15:31.466
50 minutes, one hour or so and even more more to that. But if

8102e043-7c21-4344-abdf-9bf533d95020-1
03:15:31.466 --> 03:15:34.698
you are doing the Kriya properly, it would take a

8102e043-7c21-4344-abdf-9bf533d95020-2
03:15:34.698 --> 03:15:36.120
minimum of 40 minutes.

9cc271d6-4ee3-4c9a-b234-2dd8a4efffa9-0
03:15:41.880 --> 03:15:45.130
Should we do bandas after
Sukriya Namaskaram Kunal?

c0eec42a-4f58-4caa-8e7e-3c863fa7531a-0
03:15:46.870 --> 03:15:49.290
How did we do pandas today after
Sukriya?

a1d331d7-b4f4-4cb0-9104-336f90b828b5-0
03:15:50.730 --> 03:15:52.830
So no bandas after Sukriya.

9914846b-b355-46d7-bb66-2104fd20441a-0
03:15:55.060 --> 03:15:57.929
I remember learning math prakriya with Kumbhaka and

9914846b-b355-46d7-bb66-2104fd20441a-1
03:15:57.929 --> 03:16:01.184
Shunya in 2006 and Swan and
Kakariya did not have kumbhaka

9914846b-b355-46d7-bb66-2104fd20441a-2
03:16:01.184 --> 03:16:04.550
that time. Should I follow the new instruction or old steps?

4640bddc-679e-450c-af7b-fc783e47c92e-0
03:16:07.180 --> 03:16:10.222
Okay so thats why the online sessions for you. So today

4640bddc-679e-450c-af7b-fc783e47c92e-1
03:16:10.222 --> 03:16:13.645
session is for you. So whatever the instructions that has been

4640bddc-679e-450c-af7b-fc783e47c92e-2
03:16:13.645 --> 03:16:16.090
told today, please follow that instructions.

5807117f-e6b8-40c6-b2b5-97b325aba424-0
03:16:17.200 --> 03:16:21.270
This is for NEELE. I am sorry.
OK Namaskaram Nile.

3facd5f2-e9dd-43e8-9604-a34f7301ec12-0
03:16:22.700 --> 03:16:26.010
During poorna mudra do we need to touch all fingers

04f973aa-d514-4992-a283-2b257bc92623-0
03:16:27.460 --> 03:16:31.290
entering point or just touching ring finger is fine. I am not

04f973aa-d514-4992-a283-2b257bc92623-1
03:16:31.290 --> 03:16:35.183
able to touch first finger at the ring point. So when you hold

04f973aa-d514-4992-a283-2b257bc92623-2
03:16:35.183 --> 03:16:39.076
purna mudra the priority is like your ring finger should touch

04f973aa-d514-4992-a283-2b257bc92623-3
03:16:39.076 --> 03:16:42.659
each other. So when the ring finger touch each other, the

04f973aa-d514-4992-a283-2b257bc92623-4
03:16:42.659 --> 03:16:46.120
rest of the fingers should automatically fall in place.

c4acb0b3-b310-41d7-8374-6da62250f35d-0
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:50.965
But at some instance there is a tendency for a pointing finger

c4acb0b3-b310-41d7-8374-6da62250f35d-1
03:16:50.965 --> 03:16:52.720
to come out. That's OK, but

ad68b59d-67b7-4666-ba01-f1d26816d2dd-0
03:16:53.590 --> 03:16:54.820
it should be the fists.

5e9c1ffc-5f96-4d05-8109-8ba4ee7973e9-0
03:16:55.620 --> 03:16:58.303
The ring finger should touch each other and rest of the

5e9c1ffc-5f96-4d05-8109-8ba4ee7973e9-1
03:16:58.303 --> 03:17:01.130
fingers. You make an effort so that they touch each other.

d8a93ba7-bec1-48d5-adba-9dae837bd0c9-0
03:17:03.130 --> 03:17:05.780
Haka please explain. Punch sahakriya for lungs.

0f471cc6-4f12-4c3a-a0d3-31c2ebc2f58a-0
03:17:08.770 --> 03:17:14.451
So lungs have 3 loops so we do puja sahitya for lungs for 3

0f471cc6-4f12-4c3a-a0d3-31c2ebc2f58a-1

0b78cc09-bbcb-4174-8fc5-4693bce0a9ee-2
03:21:51.148 --> 03:21:53.679
Namaskaram sandhya. So you start with

e8b33bf0-0952-4681-9506-5e788dec8ed1-0
03:21:54.510 --> 03:21:55.290

03:21:56.200 --> 03:22:00.977
then hot yoga practices that is
Surekha or Surya Shakti. Then

00cf297d-1c6d-45c7-b6e8-eb6940f5529b-1
03:22:00.977 --> 03:22:05.370
Shakti, Chalana, Kriya and
Shambhavi. I repeat Guru Puja

693a3955-5cb1-476e-bcd5-0d6dc677442a-0
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:09.617
Surya Kriya or Surya Shakti
Shakti Chalana Kriya and

693a3955-5cb1-476e-bcd5-0d6dc677442a-1
03:22:09.617 --> 03:22:10.220
Shambhavi

39f8be0d-87a8-4ed4-b1cf-72b05279dd22-0
03:22:14.260 --> 03:22:15.580
Namaskaram zero

d2663e37-38d1-47d0-82b2-b3549a44b947-0
03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:20.098
about the 4 to 5 to breath.
Should we commit to breathe

d2663e37-38d1-47d0-82b2-b3549a44b947-1
03:22:20.098 --> 03:22:24.135
slowly and fully first or the ratio first? If I inhale as

d2663e37-38d1-47d0-82b2-b3549a44b947-2
03:22:24.135 --> 03:22:28.033
slowly as fully as I can, then exhale as 5 will be some

d2663e37-38d1-47d0-82b2-b3549a44b947-3
03:22:28.033 --> 03:22:28.729
difficult.

9afc0ee6-8770-48c8-a0a7-6c2ebbb4e05c-0
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:33.100
So in Mudra Kriya,

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-0
03:22:33.940 --> 03:22:38.291
it's always your full and slow breaths, but it is your natural

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-1
03:22:38.291 --> 03:22:42.574
breath. Do not go beyond your capacity. Do not go beyond what

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-2
03:22:42.574 --> 03:22:46.511
you what you can inhale or exhale for. It should be full

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-3
03:22:46.511 --> 03:22:50.517
and slow, but it should still be your natural breaths. So

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-4
03:22:50.517 --> 03:22:54.454
ideally, if you see your exhalations are anyway a little

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-5
03:22:54.454 --> 03:22:58.944
longer than your inhalations, if you simply sit here and breathe

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-6
03:22:58.944 --> 03:23:03.227
with your eyes closed, you will see that your exhalations are

77333e4a-92f6-40c2-a22d-27c47efb4ee6-7
03:23:03.227 --> 03:23:05.989
naturally longer than your inhalations.

af7e7db2-6bf6-4711-ab4b-47823d471596-0
