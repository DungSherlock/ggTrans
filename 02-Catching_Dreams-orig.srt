1
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,280
Well,

2
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,240
we have just been around the United States,

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,840
touching various

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,000
Native American

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,880
nations.

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
One aspect

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,400
of Native American culture

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,560
or symbols

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,840
which has traveled far and wide in the world

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,240
 is a dream catcher.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,720
it's like a willow hoop

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
made in the form of a spider web

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,240
hanging with a few beads

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,760
and some feathers.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,240
it is said it originates in Ojibwe

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,800
tribe or nation,

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,440
later on different versions

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,080
of the same thing reflected

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,720
in nations like Lakota, Apache, Oneida.

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,600
They came up with their own versions

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,040
of the dream catcher,

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,840
and it's gone everywhere

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,280
in the world.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,920
In many touristy places around the world,

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,360
you will see dream catchers are being sold.

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,840
The local vendor

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,800
claiming it is from that culture.

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,920
Well, in the Ojibwe tribe,

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
 if it was a girl child, they put

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
feathers from an owl;

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,480
if it is a boy child,

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840
they put feathers from

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
an eagle.

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,440
Owl in these cultures

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,600
symbolized wisdom.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know how that happened

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,720
because similar things

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,960
are said

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,080
probably in European cultures also.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,960
But in India,

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,520
owl symbolizes

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,040
stupidity.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,480
So

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,880
somehow

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,800
the tribes thought girls need wisdom,

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
boys need strength and courage.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,760
Maybe they gave up on wisdom

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,200
with the male children.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,480
To work upon something,

50
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,800
there must be a possibility.

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,640
So dream catchers

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,720
became popular.

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,680
Essentially, this was designed

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,480
for infants.

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,520
Well,

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,600
in India,

57
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,320
I think everywhere, but I will say

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,240
Southern India because I've seen this,

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,200
and I've heard people talking about it,

60
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,320
and I know this as a child.

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
Because I have this problem

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,360
of remembering

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
everything, inconsequential

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,960
things

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,240
that torments people around me many times.

66
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Because I remember how you're breathing,

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
how you sat down, how you stood up,

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,480
how you looked, how you did not look,

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,840
everything,

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,000
from a very early age, since infancy.

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,720
When a child is born,

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,840
life enters

73
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
the fetus in a certain way,

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,400
somewhere between forty-two

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,120
to forty-eight days.

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,040
So

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,080
when life enters the fetus

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,640
which was just flesh till then 

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,280
and becomes a life,

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,160
it enters through the...

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,640
the soft opening which is there in the skull

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,160
which is called as Brahmarandra.

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,760
In yoga,

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,440
a whole effort is to live there

85
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,920
and to leave from there;

86
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,160
because

87
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,480
birth

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,040
or infusion of life

89
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,360
into a piece of flesh

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,600
is not your doing,

91
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
it is the intelligence

92
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,760
of

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,680
creation or creator.

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,680
We want to live there

95
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,800
and we want to leave also from there.

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,080
So the whole effort is that

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
- Sahasrar.

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,520
It was amazing for me to find out

99
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,040
that the Native American cultures

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,000
were conscious

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,560
about

102
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,280
this Brahmarandra

103
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,000
which they refer to as the doorway

104
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,440
or kopavi

105
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
in their languages.

106
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,200
Life enters into the fetus

107
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,760
through this and slowly it's sealing up.

108
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,560
Not fully sealed

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,960
because the gestation period

110
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
is not long enough

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,640
for this closure to happen

112
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,880
and maybe it's not

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,080
the best thing to close it

114
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,520
before being born.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Because if that gets closed,

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,800
the child's skull would be too rigid

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,040
for any mother to bear a child.

118
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
So little softness of the skull

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,600
has to be retained means

120
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,320
the central spot is open.

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,560
The different plates are still moving around.

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,920
In Southern India...

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,520
I'm sure everywhere the midwives did this

124
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,400
but now qualified doctors

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
don't allow such things anymore,

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,880
I think.

127
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,960
I'm sorry if I'm saying something wrong,

128
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,240
because there are pediatricians here.

129
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,840
They're all in disguise,

130
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,000
so it's okay.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,840
Midwives around the world,

132
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
I think would have done it

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,880
but in India,

134
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,040
they're very conscious of it.

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
When a child is born,

136
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,160
for the first few months

137
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,320
they shape the skull with their hands.

138
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,680
They will put lots of oil

139
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,440
and slowly shape the skull

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,320
and they'll put their fingers

141
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,640
inside the mouth of the child

142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,800
and every day lift up this plate

143
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,560
so that the nose will stand out, that

144
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,480
it doesn't go back like this.

145
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,320
In our families if a grownup person comes

146
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,720
and he's got this kind of nose,

147
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,120
they'll say

148
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,000
what kind of mother he should have.

149
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,640
Somebody, an ignorant mother

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,800
who didn't do what she has to do.

151
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,320
They will pull up this every day

152
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,880
when they are giving...

153
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
washing the child.

154
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,920
Every day

155
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,080
they will put their fingers inside

156
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,760
with honey on their hands

157
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
so that the child doesn't

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,400
complain too much

159
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,520
and slowly, slowly push this up

160
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,440
so that this bone

161
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,520
will come up a little bit,

162
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
and the nose will stand out properly,

163
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,360
and the skull becomes reasonably round.

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,320
That means it's flexible.

165
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
So as long as it's flexible,

166
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
this is open.

167
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
Up to how many months?

168
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,480
A maximum of thirty months it's open.

169
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,040
Maximum.

170
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
But a minimum of nine to eleven months,

171
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,960
definitely open for everybody.

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,440
But for some children, it's

173
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,480
open up to thirty months.

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
This depends on various factors.

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
Let's not go into that.

176
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,520
So when this is open,

177
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,320
the child is capable - Not only

178
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,400
he attracted life

179
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
through this and it's already alive, 

180
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,480
a full-fledged life.

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
To be born means and alive

182
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,880
means it is full-fledged life.

183
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,160
But still this child

184
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,160
can attract other kinds of forces.

185
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,960
Because this is open,

186
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,200
other kinds of forces or other life forms

187
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,080
still thinking of getting there

188
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,960
because the gate is open.

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
So one thing they do is 

190
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,640
when they put the child to sleep,

191
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,160
they will tie a cloth around this.

192
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,080
Have you seen this?

193
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,400
In Southern India, villages only...

194
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,240
Now in hospitals, they don't allow all that.

195
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,560
They will tie a...

196
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,400
a cloth, like this a little tight,

197
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,840
and they will take this lamp black,

198
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,040
you know, carbon,

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and put one big spot

200
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
 somewhere.

201
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,560
Because when certain forces

202
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,160
think that gate is open and trying to go,

203
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,640
one thing it's blocked,

204
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,320
another thing is the carbon from the...

205
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,800
the wet carbon,

206
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,360
which is oily carbon, 

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,640
has a tendency to draw this.

208
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,840
If you don't know this,

209
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,640
people who do occult things,

210
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,080
people who do this kind of sorcery

211
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,640
and other things,

212
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,840
they always smear their hands

213
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,640
with lamp carbon

214
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,080
because they want to draw them.

215
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
Well,

216
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,000
the young woman are putting lamp carbon

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
around their eyes,

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
because they want to draw.

219
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,520
Whom they draw is a different matter but...

220
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,240
So this as long as it's open,

221
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,400
there is possibility

222
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
and this possibility

223
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,760
will greatly be enhanced

224
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,720
if the child's focus

225
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,160
is somewhere between eighteen

226
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,400
to 21 inches from

227
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,880
their forehead.

228
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,640
If you have not noticed...

229
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:48,240
Those who have children must have noticed that an infant has a tendency to look here.

230
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,840
Have you noticed this?

231
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,520
Hello.

232
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,720
An infant, when it lies down like this,

233
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,640
like this, like this,

234
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
we do something, he will look here.

235
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,960
If you leave him alone,

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,240
the moment his focus gets to that place,

237
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,840
this becomes far more open.

238
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,960
Now gates are open with a welcome board.

239
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,880
So we don't want a child

240
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,560
to focus at eighteen to 21 inches.

241
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,680
We want a child to focus somewhere else.

242
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
So one thing we do is - in olden times

243
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,720
they took this,

244
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,000
you know,

245
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,760
coconut frond done in variety of ways

246
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,480
and colored in many ways

247
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,840
red, blue, yellow, all kinds of multi colors,

248
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,040
and you put it there in the...

249
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,440
you know,

250
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
even with the slightest breeze

251
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,480
it rolls,

252
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,320
and the child will look like that.

253
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,720
But that's out there,

254
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,480
more than twenty-four inches,

255
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,600
beyond 21 inches always.

256
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,080
Because we don't want the child

257
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,960
to lie there with this open

258
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
because we do not know

259
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,600
what will get into him.

260
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,560
So

261
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,640
we did not call it dream catcher.

262
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,280
It's a distractor.

263
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,080
We don't want the child's vision to focus

264
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
which naturally tends to focus there.

265
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,360
As long as this is open,

266
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
up to thirty months,

267
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
the child has a tendency to look here.

268
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,120
That should not happen.

269
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,560
He must look away.

270
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,840
So some colorful distraction.

271
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,280
Most cultures, knowingly or unknowingly,

272
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,520
created this distraction, isn't it?

273
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,120
Everywhere they created some distraction

274
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,720
for the child

275
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,200
so that he will look like this,

276
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,560
not just become like this.

277
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
But

278
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,120
people also believe that

279
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
if you don't put this,

280
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,880
a child will become squint-eyed

281
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,800
which may not be true.

282
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,160
But because he is looking like this,

283
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
they think he may get fixed like that.

284
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,320
But have you noticed this?

285
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,040
A child's focus, an infant's

286
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,000
focus is like this.

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,920
It has to become like this.

288
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,080
Then only has proper binocular vision

289
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,880
which is very vital for a grown up human being.

290
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,640
Well, even adult human beings,

291
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,080
if they want to open their Sahasrar,

292
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,320
we make them focus 

293
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
between eighteen to 21 inches.

294
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,960
If this focus is maintained

295
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
in an infant,

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
there are many possibilities.

297
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,440
Sometimes very negative.

298
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,480
Sometimes it could work out positive,

299
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
but that's rare.

300
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,920
But negative things can happen in a child's life.

301
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,720
Child may lose its life,

302
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,240
but that is the least of the problems.

303
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
But child may grow into a very complex

304
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,080
and complicated mess

305
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,960
because other kinds of forces...

306
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,240
whether they entered or not,

307
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,760
they intervened

308
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,560
which influences this life

309
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,320
in a big way which some people

310
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,480
may never be able to shed in their entire life.

311
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,400
Some may grow out of it.

312
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,480
You will see

313
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,040
there are some children

314
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,160
who are unreasonably,

315
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,560
without any reason or basis,

316
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
they are simply troublesome.

317
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,960
They're torturous to themselves

318
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,560
and to everybody till

319
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,120
they are of four, five, six years or age,

320
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,880
and then after that they're quite okay.

321
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,840
One reason could be this, 

322
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,440
that certain forces

323
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,400
influenced their kopavi

324
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,720
as it is called

325
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,480
in Native American culture, Brahmarandra

326
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,680
in India.

327
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,800
It influenced that dimension.

328
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,320
So that influence could last like that.

329
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,680
For some, it may last a lifetime.

330
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,240
Unless they do some serious sadhana

331
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,400
to get rid of it,

332
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
it may be all through their life.
