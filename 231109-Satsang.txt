We would like to begin with a short audio by Zach Wu on one of the aspects of Inner Engineering.
Please visit with your eyes closed.
If you have loved one person in your life, you would find these two hands are not enough.
But definitely for all the beings in this world these two hands are not enough.
But just because our hands are small, just because our hands are small,
we don't have to make ourselves small.
Just look into yourself and see, there is enough space for everybody in your being.
It is only limitation of action, but in terms of experience, in terms of your ability to include,
there is simply no limit. Our hands are small.
They should not compel us to make ourselves small.
Continue to sit with your eyes closed, take a minute and give yourself a crash call from Inner Engineering.
Remind yourself of the aspects of the program.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

I am focused between your eyebrows.
Then, in the focus between your eyes, engage the boundaries.
Continue to sit with your eyes closed.
We will be able to apply to the eyes closed by the focus between your eyebrows.
I have to say, we will do that again.

Now we will do the Shambhavi Mahamudra Triya together.
So sitting in Adasbudasana, first do the Shukha Kriya or six, two, seven a minute.
Then, ho yoga mudra and attains the now arm for 21 times.
Ahu and Maha should be attains for an approximately equal amount of time.
You should notice the vibrations moving from the navel to the tip of the nose.
Then with a slightly up and face and my focus between your eyebrows, you do the viparita swana of lettering of the breath for three to four minutes.
Then, maintaining the focus between your eyebrows, you engage the bandas or the blocks.
After the bandas, continue to sleep with your eyes closed with a slightly up and face, my focus between your eyebrows and watch the natural movement of the breath for five to six minutes.
We will keep the timing for you.
Once you finish the bandas, you can continue to close your eyes.
After watching the movement of your breath, we will be chanting the Brahmanas, that's what we will pack together.
Now please close your eyes.
Please keep your eyes closed throughout the Kriya.
Shukha Kriya, you can stop.
Shukha Kriya.

Let's maintain a few minutes of silence through this whole period.
Please keep your eyes closed and see if you can remain still during the period of silence.
The mantra that you will chant now is a consecrated sound.
It could be used with phenomenal impact.
Especially those of you who are struggling with lack of focus, fear, disturbed lives,
it could make a lot of difference just this sounds.
This is a certain arrangement of sounds assimilated in a certain way
and consecrated for a specific purpose.
You not only chant this now, you can also make use of this wherever you may be,
whenever you need this.
This is also a means for you to access me.
If you want a living presence of who I am,
this is a simple way for you to find that access.
Shampo.

bus car shared became more peaceful and joy
joyful
via letter share experienced the high after the light weekend and awesome energy increased
the first week then had a low during day eight ten
kept going to practice twice a day now leaving a higher gap is an up and down
thanks bring that share I badly can't seem to release the dark brown and other lots of
briefly always doing my moteniously hopefully I can do it soon correctly
chakra share never go around experience many miracles and positive changes in my life
young being young he shared I have recently started practicing Surah Korea and it is not
the ability enhancing my spanana I would like to encourage everyone to learn Surah Kriya
Maha Swandra share initial few days it was typical gradually getting adopted
Anita share I also have become more patient not as is this stress or frustrated with things
not going the way I expected
that car share peaceful and joyful feeling more healthy
he has been an amazing experience thank you to all the volunteers for making it possible
really cashier and car share shambhavi has made a huge difference to my life
and he able to mean to feel calm even in stressful situation
though I am sometimes unable to stick to my daily fattana due to tight work schedule
we will try to get back to daily fattas
real share namaskarama recently started my first work and doing shambhavi before work
every day has made my day very difficult despite a wet load and tark
Grishamma share my priorities that becoming clearer and I am being able to tell the difference
between a temporary distraction and a life priority in moments when I am feeling negative
this means that I am able to nail out of negative circles and move to the move on to feeling light
clear, headed and joyful purposeful
more quickly than I used to I also feel that need to be external validation
ring share I experienced one of the things already did by all starting three weeks ago when a chronic call has disappeared
even though I am more patient and beautiful but I do revert back to psychological dramas from time to time
I am striving to become more conscious
okay so now we have some time for our practice related question you can type your question on the chat box
if you have any questions regarding the practice
does taking name affect anti-stammer condition? no you can take the name and term read just a small name ball and term read
how to release the lock step by step so when you ask this question whether you are clear about the instructions or not
it is quite important that you are clear with the instructions and with the practice slowly you can do it along with the practice
so how to do I think let me repeat the steps after the locks once again
so you inhale fully after the inhalation is complete you take your head back, check your chin in and bring it down there are three movements in this
taking your head back, checking your chin and bring it down this is the net lock and then as soon as you do this you probe your data from it
this is the data from lock and then constrict the animal muscles that open up this is the DNA lock you stay here as long as comfortable for you
it is called kumbaka so you stay kumbaka as long as comfortable for you when you feel like expelling you bring your head up, expelling your nose strokes
after the inhalation is complete you take your head back, check your chin in and bring it down
the other two locks are still intact so you stay in the emptiness of day in the shunya kha
the emptiness of day in the shunya kha
you stay here as long as comfortable for you when you feel like inhaling you bring your head up, inhale through the nostrils
after the inhalation is complete then relax the diaphragm lock only after you relax the diaphragm lock you release the animal
it needs to happen in this order so first you need to clear about the steps and then later with practice you can do it
if after one month of practicing shama vima hampu if you are still not able to get the locks properly then you need to see whether there is some weakness in your
body and if it is that case then you need to lubricate to start with some hata yoga practice to enhance to stabilize your body
last week can you explain sukha korea so sukha korea is sitting under the diaphragm left hand arm facing up
the holes loosely on your left the whole arms are loosened relax and use your right hand to do this korea you use the thumb and little finger
you press your right nostril and inhale through the left nostril then inhale through the thumb nostril after the inhalation is complete
you open the right and block the left nostril with a little finger and exhale through the thumb nostril and then again inhale through the thumb nostril after the inhalation
complete switch exhale through the left when you do sukha korea please remember to point first you always start and end the korea with an
isolation through the left nostril and only after the inhalation you change the nostril you switch after the inhalation
you do sukha korea being absolutely focused on the breath the korea will not become a korea unless your mind and breath become one
so do it being absolutely focused on the breath do it slowly gently do it as slowly and gently as it is possible for you
okay Brindha is there any way to ensure I do not release of the last second or second time during the vandas
I already explained this questions earlier you need to clear about the instructions and along with the sometimes of practice you can get it
Manu Haran Namaskarama is still not able to get the vandas correct steel practicing
yeah just like what I said just now for the korea the instruction and with a few more days of practice you should be able to get it right
is kumba kha and shunya kha needed to be equal amount of time or as long as possible so when you do the vandas the important thing is that
use day in kumba kha or shunya kha as long as it is comfortable for you each one of us will have a different lung capacity so the time is different
and you don't need to make ensure that the timing of shunya kha is the same just stay there as long as it is comfortable for you
generally the timing for kumba kha will be longer than shunya kha
can you explain fluttering of the breath so you keep your face lightly up and a mile focus between your eyebrows and get your breath into a flutter
flutter means both in and out done rapidly it just happens at the very end of your posture very narrow it is not deep breathing is the share of beauty
and you do it as fast as you can
if we can see if we practice shukha korea up by shumabhi do we need to sit in our eyes with the fana
yes you need to sit in our eyes with shukha korea anita i find that when i do fluttering of the breath if you use the bit different every time i do it
and the pace of my breath changes even during each practice how can i be more consistent
so you make sure first you make sure you keep your face lightly up and a mile focus between your eyebrows and folk and do the fluttering
so your focus should be on the breath you do the fluttering and since you just do when you do the fluttering you just remember to point first is share of it's a share of breathing not deep breathing
and then do it as fast as you can and each time depends on your physical condition your psychological condition
every time the feeling may be different it is okay you just dig to the correct instruction of the fluttering of the breath
lightly up and my focus between your eyebrows and get your breath into a flutter flutter means both in and out then rapidly adapt the system of your nostril
and I get very out of breath while fluttering i hope you will get better in time so the reason why you are out of breath is because your inhalation and isolation is not approximately equal
so you need to be conscious to bring the balance between your inhalation and isolation and you can continue for three to four minutes just be aware of the inhalation and isolation in and out
how to tap the chin properly during bandana how to know the neck is locked properly if you can tap the chin properly the neck is locked properly
so how to tap the chin is you take your head back and don't bring your head down directly so you take your head back your head stays there and then tap your chin in
and then bring it down so you need to make sure that this is three movement in this breath you take your head back don't move your head just tap your chin in and then bring it down
since we have limited timing we can look at the questions after the session

and this year the magazine it will fall from the 13th December and we are happy to announce this platinum it's a time for your stability and balance it from it from 15 December until 14 January
the magazine sadana is available at the each I got center for 21 days 14 days 7 days 5 days 3 days the registration will be available soon

and the other dash was will be available at the medical school locations if you are interested to notice you can get come with your local volunteer coordinators
now we will be going through a group will going through a program a video that talks about the significance of the magazine mark this dating ada data with your palm painting upwards
we are at a time of the year we just considered significant for those who are in the spiritual path
the term month of Margolis starts from 16th what is the significance of this month?
it is at this time of the year that the planet earth is closest to the sun so this should have been the hottest month but this is the time when the planet is shy of the sun
and the northern face faces away from the sun in the southern hemisphere this is the end of the year in the northern hemisphere this is the coolest part of the year
because the northern hemisphere or the northern face of the planet is facing away from the sun but it is closest so in terms of temperature because of the closeness to the sun
the angle at which the sun's rays hit the planet is very diffused but in terms of sun's gravity functioning on the planet right now it is at the highest so the maximum pull of the sun's gravity is functioning upon the planet at this time
so this Margolis month is a time to bring balance to the system it is like if something is flying all over if you just pull it it gets centralized
so that is the effect that the Margolis month has on the human system it pulls you from the base so it brings balance and stability recognizing this that one needs to bring balance and stability this is a time when there are practices in the yogic system
which has trained me to itself into culture in many different ways this is a time when men will do what generally what women are supposed to do and women will do what men are supposed to do in the sense
in Tamil Nadu there is a culture that this is a time when men will go on Nagarasan kirtan that means men will practice devotion they will sing singing and devotion is largely considered feminine so men will practice this
women will practice making geometrical figures geometry and masculinity are very directly connected if a woman sees something that is not say women if feminines see something it will always pay maximum significance to the color and form of that
if the masculine sees something it always sees the geometry first and then the color and the form so it is this month women practice geometry not on paper but in front of their homes through the Margolis month every woman is supposed to draw geometrical figures
of course today you have templates they are no good you must practice geometry because shifting from color and form to geometrical shapes and forms this is a simple transformation of a certain science into a cultural dimension
because of the closeness to the sun because of a general pool downward Mooladhara becomes the most dominant because Mooladhara becomes most dominant the preservative nature of life becomes dominant in the body
in the yogic system we would say when the preservation is dominant this is not a time to grow all life in the northern hemisphere is that it is a minimum right now the growth of the tree the plant and if you plan to seed you can see this the growth will be slowest at this time not only because of the temperature because of a general pool downward
so because the growth will be held back because of a certain inertia in the life force this is the time the body can recoup itself this is the time body can preserve itself well
the inertia cost in all aspects of life because of the closeness of the sun and being on the wrong side everything being pulled down seed will not sprout very well recognizing this Margoli the month of Margoli there never are any marriages in Tamil Nadu
still it is being maintained because this is not a time for conception even those who are in the life of householders even a grasita practices brahmacharya for this period generally
it is based on this you see people are going to the hills 40 days of brahmacharya before they go there because this is not a time for conception because the seed will not sprout as well as it would another time
so in the science of breeding the right kind of human beings Margoli is not the time to conceive there are many aspects attached to this we don't have to go by that because it will develop a whole prejudice against the December born people
no December born is not the problem December conceived not necessarily so it is just that to sink our lives with the natural moments of the earth to see that we ride the cycles of this planet
we are not crushed by the cycles of this planet in the process of evolving life
when I say in the process of evolving life I am not talking about how to make monkeys into human beings I am talking about how to make human beings into better human beings
better not just physically better not just mentally but as a life a better life
always one life better than the other this is a difficult thing but if you closely observe one life to another you will see how one life functions
not in terms of social actions not in terms of capability and competence simply how life functions within the system is different from person to person
the system of yoga is seeing how to make this life function at highest people think highest means will I be the most successful person on the planet will I run 100 meters in so many seconds
better does not mean that better simply means as a piece of life it is better
there is no context to speak about this dimension in normal parlance or in English language particularly there is no way to say it because life is all same
yes life is all same but it can function better if you will love it it will function better if you do not love it it will not function as well
whether we like it or we don't like it that's how it is one the same you must see there is a beautiful example in the spandahal garden we planted two nuglingum trees
one we've taken care of them equally well one has grown and flower other is always struggling
there are different reasons for that but it's like this in the same home to children a bond one just flourishes within himself another struggles all the way
because for life to happen it needs a conducive atmosphere creating that conducive atmosphere and allowing life to happen better this time of the year has maximum possibility in this direction
you know about definitely you know about the story of Bismar waiting to cross this Baxina in a tooth arena before he left his body
because he wants to be out of this pool to the south south is called down is called south so if it is pulling down the mooladhara will be strongest the preservative aspect will be strongest
he does not want to leave at that time he wants the son to move away to a place where there is an upward pull to his body
there's an upward pull to his being so that he can ascend in a proper way
the Margarly is significant for a spiritual seeker because it brings a natural sense of stability into the system particularly those who are suffering from any kind of ailments
particularly psychological imbalances this is a good time to balance because the sun's energy and the sun's gravity is pulling downward one can stabilize themselves
stability if you're pulled upward so this is called a sadhana Prada and this is the peak of sadhana that if you do the necessary sadhana at this time
generally traditionally people don't want to miss the Brahman Mahurtam in this month that is a 340 they're all up and there are various processes to keep in touch with water
there are many systems and many cultural practices and yogic practices to keep in touch with water because water is the largest element within you
and water is one thing that could slosh if your waters are not proper it will cause imbalance in the system
in the yogic system if there is a psychological imbalance it is always seen as water element going out of control
because if you have a tank full of water and shake it it will slosh if you have a tank full of sand or mud it will not slosh the same way
so the water element is what causes various levels of imbalance in a person if the right kind of things are not done with it
so traditionally there are various practices to be in touch with water one of the simplest thing is people always went into temple ponds at 3.14 in the morning to take a dip
it would be good we should keep our tirtha kund open early this month from 16th to 13th of 14th of January
we must keep it open very early those who want to make use of it can make use of it
bringing stability to the waters within
psychological balance only when there is psychological balance and physiological balance and energy balance will you dare to climb
otherwise a little one step if everything shakes inside of you you will only step backwards
there are any number of spiritual seekers who are constantly one step forward one step backward
one step forward one step backward because the moment they take a forward step they will notice imbalance and they will come back
this is happening to too many people because not enough sadhana towards stabilizing themselves
this particular month offers a phenomenal opportunity to stabilize oneself because of the way the relationship between the sun and the earth is such
that it creates maximum stability stability also means inertia it's not mobile it is table
so it causes a certain level of inertia and also stability so this month is used for stability
and the next month the thigh is used for mobility if you have created enough stability within you
then only you would dare to be mobile only if you're riding a bicycle only if you're well balanced
will you dare to move otherwise you will sit on a bicycle with the stand ons yes that's how life is happening for a lot of people
because of the fear of instability they sit on a bicycle with the stand on you can pedal you can get some exercise but you're not going anywhere
so Margoli is a blessed month which is used for various processes across the Shiva temples in the south
there are various events happening on 16, 17, 18th of this month
the one important step is the arudra purges that happen, rudra means a roarer somebody who is very effervescent
more than effervescent a roar arudra means stable not roaring
arudra also suggests a certain inertia because rudra suggests moment and creation
arudra suggests no moment and a certain inertia there is inertia there is enormous inertia in this part of the ear
but the wise should make use of whatever there is and we need a certain level of inertia to bring stability
when you want to bring stability the thing is to slow down if you lose balance the first thing is to slow down
so this is a time when everything slows down and people want to make use of it and that is why this Margoli has become significant in
in a spiritual seekers life
you are my perfect mirror you show me what I'm not in the endless pit of what once was me, leah and leah you peel off me
the pain is but the joy it brings so thank you for showing me what I'm not for showing me what I could be
thank you endlessly
now we will be going through a meditation guide if I'm such a good
we'll do a simple process I'll guide you through this just go with me if you do not understand something or there are some variety of people here
should I pick out all those little loud people and throw them out or it's okay
hello they scream they scream you ignore them okay this doesn't mean you can scream
you
please close your eyes
those of you wearing spectacles please keep it aside
sit with a slightly upturned face your hands facing upward loose and relaxed
take a deep breath and as you exhale relax into the exhalation
take one more deep breath and as you exhale you relax even more into this one
take another deep breath relax completely with this exhalation
you I should remain close throughout visualize yourself upon a pristine sandy beach
visualize yourself standing upon a pristine sandy beach
look at the sparkling translucent blue-green water of the ocean
feel the tinge of salt in your breath

heartbeat and breath into very deep recesses of the ocean, dark but very clear.
In absolute harmony with everything around you, you'll stand with me in total sync
with Mother Earth in total harmony with the one who bore you.
In absolute harmony with the Mother Earth who has given you this body, this breath,
this heartbeat, in absolute harmony with her, you'll stand with me in the very bottom of
the ocean.
Now slowly holding my hand, slowly we are rising up in the water, very slowly rising
up towards the surface, very slowly rising up, up, up, through the wrap, you're beginning
to see a little bit of light, slowly grating brighter.
Water getting warmer as you come up, light getting brighter and the water getting warmer
as you come towards the surface and as you break out of the surface, looking at the clear
sky, bright light and the air that you breathe.
In absolute harmony with all that's around you, in absolute harmony with the earth of
which you're just apart.
You keeping time with the beat of your heart, you keeping time with your inhalations and
exhalations, just in perfect harmony with Mother Earth's breath and heartbeat.
Your sense of time and her sense of time has become one, your sense of time and Mother
Earth's sense of time is now in perfect harmony.
