00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.190
a hot life or a burning hot life

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.200
or that kind of life that will evaporate?

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.770
This is a choice.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.630
Those who live at Capital Life

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.070
will wake up late,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.310
We dont know when the food is,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.710

Nothing is in place.

pleasures of life

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.610
have been robbed of us.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.620
Is this in denial of life?

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.855
Life happens in many different ways. So if you see a mango

567258ee-9a04-437e-a775-bdfb0b84af6c-1
00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:41.310
tree,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.710
if you buy it into the fruit,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.340
that is much

1203762c-c5b9-4d93-abcc-23ea4921b331-0
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.930
sweetness.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.770
If you smell the flower, there is some fragrance.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.510
If you eat the leaf,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.620
there is some bitterness, but still there is nourishment.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.400
If you bite into the bark,

2eff892a-bc3b-4d60-b6ae-04677ea94bef-0
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.250
no juice,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.570
no sweetness,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.100
no fragrance.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.200
But if you bite into the root,

61076cd4-6c78-4f47-9d7b-4fe38e3a0ab2-0
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.920
you will get mud and manure in your mouth.

b0f8c016-eee0-4c85-bd3d-008f99d9b9ca-0
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.080
But if you buy it into the root,

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.470
then root means that which decides everything.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.060
If you bite into the root of this life,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.670
then you decide

145ec3bd-a8d8-4f46-9e31-9605ec40f05e-0
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.610
what is the nature of your experience,

aaa4c459-7eb0-4591-b8f8-4055709ecbd5-0
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.130
where and how this life goes,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.520
to what purpose.

6e1c2142-8157-47a3-a29c-67e60b1b4cc7-0
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.390
You determine the destiny of your existence.

14af2b72-afa9-4c51-a042-c31603059b77-0
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.260
Once you know the pleasure

7b96a9b1-7652-42b4-b976-f59b0d110705-0
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.860
and the ecstasy of determining

72534046-e93a-467e-80fa-e1f39f6168d1-0
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.490
you

1deca0cd-e41a-40d2-acc6-f780836b5a08-0
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.130
destiny in every possible way,

0152654f-6f08-4fac-b78c-4f99399ef566-0
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.075
then eating the fruit and smelling the flower doesn't mean

0152654f-6f08-4fac-b78c-4f99399ef566-1
00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:18.390
much.

5c214fe6-2de6-45d2-bbc8-025cbbbb091c-0
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.940
Not that

16d71411-9762-4056-96a5-76a2ca7d6bd0-0
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.740
we cannot enjoy the fruit, we can.

11429066-c842-4568-8c1c-a76462476200-0
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.480
But

e9f74017-8824-4bbc-8d0d-4272e440eaec-0
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.074
when you have access to determine the nature of the

e9f74017-8824-4bbc-8d0d-4272e440eaec-1
00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:32.360
fruit.

b5424477-9b8b-4720-ab59-b93a4919814a-0
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.010
So he is this just about power over life?

ee7da9c8-729e-4edd-9b11-5f258c1ff319-0
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.430
No.

c1eaffe9-fd46-4603-a8d1-7a118ea4af44-0
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.194
You either you can leave you. Either you can live at the

c1eaffe9-fd46-4603-a8d1-7a118ea4af44-1
00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:47.600
surface

d9a64e20-ad3a-4533-81a8-afd414c8627a-0
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.170
or at the root of life.

79aa6750-b200-484a-aefd-a18bd24019ef-0
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.670
Living at the root of life

ef268d02-dec3-4c4b-95fe-cb76275fed8b-0
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.970
for external viewing looks ugly

c08bbee1-bb6c-4542-ae17-0b045d3c69e6-0
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.950
or unattractive,

8d3168e7-d624-471d-bdd1-b961e6a8656e-0
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.260
but it determines everything.

59a08228-70ba-498a-baa5-1d4a777efd97-0
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.070
It decides whether they should be a fruit or not.

69060e54-7812-4fca-a9dd-d87cfc88e232-0
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.010
So those who choose

8e6b7e0d-efca-496c-a1aa-16ae721a9721-0
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.640
to dig deep into life

01925f0e-9475-4bd9-a2a6-7e3000380ba0-0
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.300
may not know,

c7200970-a90c-4adc-aa7d-d912a1f3c9f4-0
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.149
may not know the pleasures of eating well in the afternoon and

c7200970-a90c-4adc-aa7d-d912a1f3c9f4-1
00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:31.160
having a sister.

440f4391-b31a-4d47-86be-e627e4bfeb34-0
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.650
They are all nice things. I know

b2c363be-4492-40df-bded-933f88f34f66-0
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.170
I have seen other people doing it,

95ecbb8e-f5cb-44c8-8daa-9a1a3dedacdb-0
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.880
but

dcb73b99-b605-4450-b09a-b5a5f8d34718-0
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.940
all this was OK

f227070b-1e35-4aae-8d9c-659030d31d6a-0
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.710
if time was not running out.

547fd958-09bf-4337-9257-cfbe5dd218a2-0
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.620
You could eat as much as you want.

be7d8699-cc57-40fe-bf03-a2f264347068-0
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.700
You can sleep as much as you want

00e3d4f5-983e-40df-b061-c386941f9650-0
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.830
if time was not running out.

40cfd79c-10b6-4874-a9bc-dd935168bbe8-0
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.790
If you are a limitless amount of time,

4331cda4-ea70-4b92-be21-d375729ac794-0
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.550
all this was OK.

172895e3-0d8b-4840-bd2e-d1c008c2df17-0
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.060
If you have realised

98189b39-b9dc-4d7f-a73f-2771e0c7e07f-0
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.600
it's a brief amount of time,

94113bac-a5cc-427d-8db6-f75420c0dce4-0
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.560
then

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.671
everything. If you really know that it's sticking away right

14df9908-c633-4842-a82a-865ae1c23658-1
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:28.020
now,

c92f2919-c777-49cb-9277-9b8c40f5693e-0
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.116
not thinking about it, you can really feel it with every

c92f2919-c777-49cb-9277-9b8c40f5693e-1
00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:33.790
heartbeat your little closer

a8faed39-1cd8-49cc-9ba7-636b86a7c5e8-0
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.190
to it.

01104d5c-b0d0-4228-accc-52ba4b317223-0
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.650
If you know this,

dac5de20-cb7e-4f1e-ac05-09891fe4644a-0
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.832
then suppose you knew that you are going to die in the next 5

dac5de20-cb7e-4f1e-ac05-09891fe4644a-1
00:05:44.832 --> 00:05:45.300
minutes.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.951
Are you that kind? You would like to eat all the different

4e4018b2-2c97-4d0d-8b95-4f28bb7fd827-1
00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:51.600
varieties of mangoes before you go.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.850
Hello.

0a3bc093-3ea6-4d23-aef9-3ef7e74f9f94-0
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.920
No, it won't taste good. Believe me,

0081a4f3-7004-4543-bc22-366ad82d834c-0
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.738
we are not a goal against mangoes. We are not against the

0081a4f3-7004-4543-bc22-366ad82d834c-1
00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.060
sweetness of life,

5239ff0c-01ad-4652-9a20-7a9526d4593d-0
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.240
but

19fc4d6d-8972-479c-b697-f6cc6e522dba-0
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.730
it's a very limited amount of time,

7146436c-3a38-45c2-b43a-3f359c437d2e-0
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.140
so we want to buy it deep into it,

407c2909-cccf-4845-a8a6-e31452b548aa-0
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.530
not on the surface.

ded093fb-615a-4d84-aa8a-57d157e07d78-0
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.170
What determines

5628dd0b-2886-45b0-a8bf-0f6adc5708d5-0
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.750
the nature of my life?

47dcba53-1e16-42f3-ac3a-880f221b077c-0
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.960
If I don't take charge of that,

2b189bd7-07a9-4605-bfa1-19af0ff02644-0
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.790
then

d6bcb677-5d5b-4cf0-a6f6-d639eb300add-0
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.030
time will decide

fe66ee5f-1baf-41d7-aa0f-8b388eb1e8cb-0
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.280
what should happen to me.

d937654d-e24c-4424-bab3-0f226389d057-0
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.930
We don't want time to decide the fate of who I am,

8e304c1f-2276-49de-adcd-bb2b23d95734-0
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.910
because

43cdc4e8-428a-4025-818b-5befcdfb4364-0
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.370
time is just a

9f8185f0-b6f0-4bf0-926e-c2f2040c85ed-0
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.630
cyclical process

4823dec1-1384-418b-9399-72925de4d978-0
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.973
just going on. It rolls for everybody. It rolls for

4823dec1-1384-418b-9399-72925de4d978-1
00:07:14.973 --> 00:07:15.850
everything.

e7c5cae4-8c31-460b-bbdb-60e8b642a99d-0
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.820
Your sense of time

2c244307-30c5-4fd1-ad35-2b66f72b0248-0
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.770
may be very different from let's say

00b6026e-d7be-4454-8baf-645c28764a3e-0
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.996
what is the most popular creature here. Lets say a

00b6026e-d7be-4454-8baf-645c28764a3e-1
00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:30.680
mosquito

6c1ac50e-94ab-44a0-84d6-8df57cd567af-0
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.669
its only creature for which you are willing to shed your blood

6c1ac50e-94ab-44a0-84d6-8df57cd567af-1
00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:40.920
blood.

2ffdc104-a3cc-4fed-b378-753171c56163-0
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.480
So,

1583d815-8d0d-4281-945f-64710154b4bc-0
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.090
so

1156461c-0dab-4858-9e87-43ddc094caa1-0
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.860
mosquitoes life.

6a12bab2-e519-421b-baef-444b34685c43-0
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.968
There's some relationship between mosquitoes and human

6a12bab2-e519-421b-baef-444b34685c43-1
00:07:58.968 --> 00:07:59.410
beings.

126fc190-7ee3-4bac-a45d-7a0803699bc4-0
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.660
Its a 28 day life cycle.

9b30e2e1-ce07-4e56-b799-b110dd983c8b-0
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.860
You understand what I'm saying?

b45df1dd-0ed9-4fd8-a030-cc3f0739acde-0
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.520
Somehow our life cycles are also built in 28 days cycles.

fc4e3d46-4b8c-4392-ad4c-132bb260e8f0-0
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.860
Today is an important day

78187e31-885e-42a1-80ba-29937238801b-0
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.890
because today Indian space scientists are sending

613e9403-c26c-4826-99c9-2b6a6efba778-0
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.420
AH

b934d15f-5941-416b-833d-8b3646bf9fd3-0
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:30.960
a rower

3b0e0b02-e4cc-4ba1-81c1-ad57947c0c78-0
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.660
for a vehicle which will land on the moon.

2a9daea3-d5d2-4eaf-9942-3e0a083f72c2-0
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.120
Today is Chandrayaan is going to be launched,

41e5e2f6-65e0-4783-ab4c-4653324e2b27-0
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.840
so I couldn't stay away from that. I'm going for that and

41e5e2f6-65e0-4783-ab4c-4653324e2b27-1
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.130
coming back in the night.

3d78dd28-c874-4cfe-af2b-d21097671968-0
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.340
So the cycles of the moon,

ac91aa0f-8aba-40e3-be3d-54a41d12c904-0
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.280
das cycles of our mothers, bodies and mosquitoes. Somehow,

da0ac137-fe27-4e4f-94b8-aefc7a555232-0
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.900
I don't know how they fell into that cycle, but

fb4286e5-ae70-4d42-873c-a396375410c8-0
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.981
somehow they got it. So we all bleed for them somewhere over

fb4286e5-ae70-4d42-873c-a396375410c8-1
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:14.700
the other.

bc5c48b1-8113-4896-89fd-b29cd6762466-0
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.240
So how

9f54b72c-34e9-4e4b-99df-e73fd66e5cd5-0
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.605
a creature whose life cycle is
28 days, how he views time and

9f54b72c-34e9-4e4b-99df-e73fd66e5cd5-1
00:09:25.605 --> 00:09:29.160
how you view time may be very different,

c2746d21-7d7e-4b77-9a2f-73b50ea87240-0
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.960
but his life is 28 days. In 28
days he finds fulfillment

1e72af68-f888-49d4-a3af-b085711d95b3-0
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.740
because he is clearly programmed.

f11037f5-eba5-410e-9411-c489c11457b8-0
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.260
He asked to

91a5404c-1f8b-4323-95f6-f7bc26f7ebc6-0
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.140
land softly on you

6b3d129f-e8d7-41f6-a1ac-cd5c6211aa75-0
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.130
right now. This is the challenge for the scientists.

62825dd9-ddb3-4aaf-9332-e7e31d8f069b-0
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.900
They want to make a soft landing on the moon.

e2ecdc68-4451-45ff-8009-d1fa18a159f0-0
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.520
Yes,

98c0a51e-bc49-449c-8228-9b2f556130e1-0
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.240
in the past people only. I think

66325c6a-befc-4ad3-ae49-e68cd0f00fbc-0
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.885
only one country has made a soft landing. All others have hard

66325c6a-befc-4ad3-ae49-e68cd0f00fbc-1
00:10:07.885 --> 00:10:08.510
landings.

5dc3a38a-fe16-4d72-aaeb-f5b01093d3c2-0
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.638
The Indian scientists are trying for a soft landing. So they have

5dc3a38a-fe16-4d72-aaeb-f5b01093d3c2-1
00:10:12.638 --> 00:10:15.300
chosen this day because of variety of calculations.

fef7498e-7f89-408d-8dcb-d7bcd3418dc0-0
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.152
So they want to make a soft landing. A mosquito must have a

fef7498e-7f89-408d-8dcb-d7bcd3418dc0-1
00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.240
soft landing. If it is a hard landing,

fefc3a6d-58af-4050-9678-00c2dec4a44a-0
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.540
it must make such a soft landing that you don't feel it.

e985ba96-3748-462c-9738-0c3845fd877b-0
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.740
Hello.

15bf4027-d94c-487c-82ca-a69e6705814e-0
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.790
Very important.

218ee9b6-da7c-4939-a654-e75ec6bd695e-0
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.610
He makes a soft landing upon you

42506927-2060-4734-b507-63064dfa222c-0
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.980
and

58397abc-e574-4781-9b6b-6d6a52aa5eab-0
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.510
takes his nourishment from you,

d531ac3e-731c-4d45-831a-453cddc533de-0
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.490
breeds, multiplies and eyes.

2222fea0-9e62-464c-b172-ffe9afec3e67-0
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.590
He is not aspiring for anything else,

7ccb96d8-9a72-44a5-a74a-8a885a5b9fa8-0
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.370
so his life is totally fulfilled in 28 days.

5d40b9ac-7a45-4e5c-b131-1db928081368-0
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.560
So for him he has to just run the cycle.

34f2903f-3c83-4059-980f-7cfb116fb714-0
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.938
He just has to be quick enough not to get smashed by you. His

34f2903f-3c83-4059-980f-7cfb116fb714-1
00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:09.550
life is fulfilled. So

bf0be72a-c28f-4559-a19f-1dd22d27e069-0
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.710
hey has a certain perspective of time.

8a81f013-448b-4056-85ff-ad224a5116e3-0
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:23.014
His time, his sense of time is very properly built into system.

8a81f013-448b-4056-85ff-ad224a5116e3-1
00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:23.720
He knows

64eb7ba7-46fb-4be1-b83f-f68881bf2fd0-0
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.975
its coming for him. He knows he has to get his nourishment. He

64eb7ba7-46fb-4be1-b83f-f68881bf2fd0-1
00:11:28.975 --> 00:11:33.200
knows he has to breed. He knows his his life will get over.

105a8ba9-86a8-4c26-8c3f-ccd6ac934563-0
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.100
See just what a mosquito knows

19d36ff1-03bf-4089-86eb-3d05d18328a5-0
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.240
to make. You know

4fd1f68b-f0fb-48f8-8336-1c5909223c67-0
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.540
how much struggle

8cffa7a4-5bbe-4a7b-a79d-561fdad35eca-0
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.290
he knows or not?

54fdc0ef-db5f-41dd-b793-52694310210f-0
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.475
He knows that its getting over time is getting over. He knows

54fdc0ef-db5f-41dd-b793-52694310210f-1
00:11:51.475 --> 00:11:51.740
that

5d20f33c-8101-4478-b848-a4ce2200dd25-0
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.030
probably if you had only 28 days to live, you would also know.

b967f744-d77a-4bdc-a954-cb9d4ff98ee1-0
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.130
But

b0a5deda-309d-4cec-b21e-481365e21e63-0
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.730
with such a big brain, we thought

81ff45ac-bd03-46fc-b05e-eeae705ee44e-0
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.760
even if we give you 100 years, you would know

e287ab76-5f9b-4695-a891-bde0bc5c1c4d-0
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.900
this is the trust

7792b14a-a6a1-42a4-b7ca-93c5b0db7cd6-0
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.860
that nature had in you.

c1f1cd09-5597-4ba5-a9a0-85ba5f9102e5-0
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.390
These cycles

0203d244-0cfe-4e6d-9f87-60383f03972b-0
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.790
of time

d7803c4d-04e2-4c1f-8fbe-8f5f95188549-0
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.500
are not just on the clock,

ea655af8-6d21-4488-92ba-1d39e93bcdae-0
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.780
not just in the calendar, there in the body.

eb147001-889d-4638-a21e-aa520cae7781-0
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:37.175
Our idea of time. Right now, all calculations that we do are

eb147001-889d-4638-a21e-aa520cae7781-1
00:12:37.175 --> 00:12:38.920
related to the cycles

617ba992-6972-4736-89e0-404492efedcc-0
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.670
of what happens in this planetary system.

158fb0d4-6f32-44d2-b7a1-2a1059d9f532-0
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.460
If the planet rotates besides a day,

9ab6b117-da19-4d90-b411-351f3b876f32-0
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.972
if the moon goes around the planet, we say it's a month. If

9ab6b117-da19-4d90-b411-351f3b876f32-1
00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:54.720
the planet goes around the sun, we say it's a year

1ef1abac-e695-4a03-a4da-34a3de9fe860-0
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.890
the sub menu.

514507b0-e237-4fdc-9d82-7ffaf8ab7977-0
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.280
Otherwise we have no other way to measure time.

27605dad-5ce5-44e2-9400-f7a44efd9800-0
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.911
Similar cycles which are happening to the solar system

27605dad-5ce5-44e2-9400-f7a44efd9800-1
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:17.407
are the planet is happening to us because everything. Just

27605dad-5ce5-44e2-9400-f7a44efd9800-2
00:13:17.407 --> 00:13:18.170
everything

89d3c679-0f40-49ca-b870-8e062f3a2dc6-0
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.090
in this body is planet.

9eefaee5-7975-4358-b285-4b38daec340a-0
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.030
It is not divorced from the planet.

ba0d5b97-326e-43c9-9c3e-2f318a9153c8-0
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.760
It is very much intune with the planet.

ed268dc8-a505-4f37-8823-2263fabf13aa-0
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.470
Only your mind may be divorced

33413bdb-30c4-4a7c-a75e-ccc6b7f5d5b8-0
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.915
from the planet. You know this can happen. You can be in the

33413bdb-30c4-4a7c-a75e-ccc6b7f5d5b8-1
00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.730
family and still be divorced.

b6e77b07-b11a-43d9-853b-c290316a19e6-0
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.480
Hello.

6feff750-9deb-4986-86db-49e5b339d296-0
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.520
I'm just being nasty. It's OK.

ceab7ac9-5dcf-4c2c-a3b0-6a285db9b248-0
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.420
So

806a36ea-6ebe-4a0b-86fc-33c5dc620d09-0
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.140
these cycles

d44d6706-15dc-4c5f-bd31-8525c3863f4d-0
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.410
or built into our system too.

edcc7e7a-2658-4087-88ac-72df0b78090f-0
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.450
If you know something about

89d8a132-4ad0-41f8-a949-b95d1bd9d04d-0
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.870
the Geo dynamics of this planet,

e757acd7-748e-44e1-a2ad-7878721e30e4-0
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.330
you know that

b3db383f-d39d-4562-8fa6-2e7b6202bb13-0
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.620
the length of the equator

4b541dc5-07c9-4e5c-ac28-58f90417697c-0
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.150
or the circumference of this planet at the equator,

7ec2af93-e8b5-45b5-ba26-6d7212990911-0
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.960
you know the planet is around

f789cef8-6310-4f51-9d58-274fba1d60b4-0
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.435
because the various kinds of people I dont know from which

f789cef8-6310-4f51-9d58-274fba1d60b4-1
00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:23.750
planet.

aa37563d-92a4-452b-898d-9dfc5dbee954-0
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:38.543
So the circumference of this planet at the equator is 21,600

aa37563d-92a4-452b-898d-9dfc5dbee954-1
00:14:38.543 --> 00:14:40.430
nautical miles.

e9d2fb42-00d0-4c13-ab04-0e17301b275b-0
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.145
That is the number of breaths that you take per day. If you

e9d2fb42-00d0-4c13-ab04-0e17301b275b-1
00:14:47.145 --> 00:14:50.440
are breathing an average of 15
breaths per minute,

54255a95-47fb-4847-b18d-d86c2fb0ad0f-0
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.770
you will take 21,600 breaths per day.

9913c63b-bad7-4e3d-8481-34c8bee0a0d7-0
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.790
In fact,

cbaea502-86fa-4f52-9619-d16bc4189e0b-0
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.870
every mile is seen

c983040d-15f1-4ff0-9736-ed2305a18bda-0
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.480
as a breath of the planet.

4206f789-311a-479f-b0f6-066eea804d18-0
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.040
Every nautical mile

6c9916a4-f012-4701-bdfe-c9a2b869307e-0
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.280
and your breath is related to that. If you breathe this way,

d10424aa-751c-496d-b14c-e2d67d8e2ab0-0
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.040
your

af89c292-6a72-4511-9575-1be51895ae3b-0
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.580
if you are

40f76146-1848-44ec-98f3-0e40fac6a774-0
00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.540
doing your sadhana,

b85ae18f-807f-46fa-9129-5492568dffda-0
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.600
how many of you promptly do it?
Every pournami.

06adb530-1dc4-4a28-944d-7143e5a12d73-0
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.090
So the number of breaths that you breathe is naturally

f60215a0-03f9-42e2-b078-997d057a9670-0
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.260
will be aligned

fefd8437-55fa-4b42-94b0-a804a39927ac-0
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.510
to

20dd32dc-9cd3-4f54-b604-18c1a08e66c3-0
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.260
15 per minute.

3bfac3b9-ae89-48f8-841a-a3b0e44d8977-0
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.600
If you do your sadhana

dc53538c-812b-4d9c-a318-f262a74df57f-0
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.000
ah

9608797a-b63e-42e7-a29c-bbe4cc2880e4-0
00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.910
everyday

037ce498-f7fa-4ac5-80bf-e89a9f80650f-0
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.650
it will get aligned that way.

9d4e8318-e368-45fc-863a-39559b296f29-0
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.820
If it gets a lion, what is happening within the system is

49e96579-863c-492d-9688-9c3c24d9aef4-0
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.350
you are hot beat also gets aligned to that.

deb9dc8d-c862-4dda-a9a7-c470ff716e47-0
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.980
Because of this, you are In Sync

087368ac-fc10-454a-882f-94bffdf3ccb5-0
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.695
with the way the elements of this planet function. Because

087368ac-fc10-454a-882f-94bffdf3ccb5-1
00:16:22.695 --> 00:16:26.509
the same elements of functioning within you, there is a certain

087368ac-fc10-454a-882f-94bffdf3ccb5-2
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:27.940
coherence between the 2.

1971506a-390b-40d3-b791-00cb7ce0fb60-0
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.510
With this, you will live healthy and

3c841410-253a-4948-b71c-5ce40824c278-0
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
reasonably balanced within yourself.

0af85f97-d74f-47ef-8dec-da98d8d2edf0-0
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.070
If you

ac787ee1-d247-4dfc-8edd-4ef3a67eefba-0
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.550
if you happen to reduce your breath to 12 per minute,

f4034225-b6b7-4dba-ac65-6079b8096f01-0
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.120
it will become 17,280 per day.

490e2c12-c5bc-45d4-a374-f64305b5629f-0
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.150
This means

4ea7730c-ec19-4945-9e26-943ce23a9532-0
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.450
you kind of crushed time.

7bd199ba-8cee-4254-aa56-9d57a1a7ae5e-0
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.470
How does breathing crushed time as such

60b77105-afb9-4d1d-9775-806118c0cb74-0
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.226
if you let us say if you are breathing 15 breaths per minute

60b77105-afb9-4d1d-9775-806118c0cb74-1
00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:20.700
and live for 60 years,

d82c076e-1499-4e16-8a81-3fcbf9c11321-0
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.490
in 60 years you would do

88f66ac3-87b7-4909-91eb-7a425380e66e-0
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.700
12,96,000 breaths

2c438549-3da1-4cbd-adb5-745c572a9b61-0
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.710
in 60 years time.

5f234440-82e8-49d5-ada8-adea9d6b0176-0
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.410
But if you make it into 12
breaths per minute

417d4b8f-354d-4a88-bac4-db7253b9c775-0
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.620
now, you will be doing the same number of breaths in 75 years.

15695442-86b4-412f-87b0-36315a56c597-0
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:49.727
It can also translate itself as the number of years that one

15695442-86b4-412f-87b0-36315a56c597-1
00:17:49.727 --> 00:17:54.760
lives. But more than that, in terms of life potential, What

15695442-86b4-412f-87b0-36315a56c597-2
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.709
somebody will do in 675 years, you will do it in 60 years.

da9e7074-a8cc-4bcb-81ae-7fb712b35fc0-0
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.030
If you make it into 9,

5d482733-2712-455e-a1bf-6092224b555f-0
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.400
it will become

84652197-3253-4e01-a0aa-5e03987a2588-0
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.000
12,960 per day.

8742689f-b08e-4aab-b4cc-6342cdc01ed6-0
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.703
That means what is 60 years for somebody will become 100 years

8742689f-b08e-4aab-b4cc-6342cdc01ed6-1
00:18:28.703 --> 00:18:29.260
for you.

be163d64-6c25-4d9b-af9c-d15ecbc203e5-0
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.930
If you make it 6,

91857267-f388-41cc-b5fc-38f8d75e304d-0
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.200
then it will become 8640 per day.

d2a1e780-c0f8-4356-b8be-c7fcee371907-0
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:45.530
That means what is 60 years for somebody, is 150 years for you.

6356a753-6c78-4bfd-a140-73bfb7687aff-0
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.420
Either you can choose

7d5b3ed6-3f99-4587-bcb4-25377103c467-0
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.360
to enhance your lifespan

426523cb-081c-4529-a9e0-1fb7e4f09027-0
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.290
or you can choose

43cc3515-93f6-40e4-b6e6-99597e9a1928-0
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.630
to burn heavier

92fb1894-75c9-4255-9a4f-006b6cbd90bb-0
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.860
and live a more intense life.

04f1b242-89ed-46fc-a4f3-d7c686587234-0
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.760
You can burn it all ends

efc31772-c969-438e-9a03-cbbde3773ea0-0
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.960
because you are not concerned about how long.

dac67d82-feac-4cc1-b1ba-72d2972bca5e-0
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.230
You are concerned about

87d4045c-d05a-4129-b0aa-54c071a18b5a-0
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.590
how profoundly you burn,

6e954629-6fa3-43b5-908c-14a783d2d874-0
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.310
how intensely you burn.

25541c28-9b13-49ad-bd0c-9b2d7c2e390e-0
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.580
This can translate into action

de9f5c5c-cda1-4486-a949-0ed586cb033f-0
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.760
or this can translate into profoundness of experience.

5944dafa-3dfe-43cd-8df1-b12f66256176-0
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.270
Our fundamental concern is profoundness of experience.

4c9d368b-950d-4eb3-8bd1-1cab6ed596b5-0
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:42.055
What would happen to me in 150
years? If it can be compressed

4c9d368b-950d-4eb3-8bd1-1cab6ed596b5-1
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.100
to 60 years,

7a6f71ca-5cc0-4529-8579-a8899319b6bd-0
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.550
then the intensity of experience is big.

7be66d57-ccc7-4684-97d2-8a5b171704c1-0
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.300
In a way,

90e04dfd-1ba6-43ac-bf39-3dea6e97f0fc-0
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.140
every dimension of spiritual process means just this.

d25484e1-cd66-441b-8254-77b87309a62e-0
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.570
It is to put you on a Fast forward.

b0441cb2-a3b1-4342-8a69-6cc35b3893ed-0
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.900
On one level,

ff6514f6-6b15-47e2-bde9-0b0afa353a7e-0
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.060
if we want to put your

59f61b36-2dde-4618-ac4b-839767794c6f-0
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.470
karmic substance and past forward,

12f56d4a-cbb8-45dc-8c35-eae763142ad3-0
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.050
you have to slow down the body

2b32eaa5-9b8a-451f-a084-9fa0c411cc02-0
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.000
otherwise you will go quick.

69d1261b-06e4-4d1d-956c-9708a8850980-0
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.080
This is the thing,

ca2b6dab-abd0-4fab-ab3e-892c21632774-0
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.340
and This is why devotees die early.

a6fefa34-80de-4bc9-b65d-823c344ea72e-0
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.490
Just

34484d5c-91e7-46c6-80a4-4075f4714d79-0
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.470
because a genuine devotee, not

5b578e01-9ab1-4498-a078-f87e7b39aec5-0
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.160
those who pray morning and evening

4ba00142-66ad-4893-841b-fb79eae39210-0
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.180
for safety, not the insurance devotees.

e1b77f4c-bc87-4555-ba16-a35f68302455-0
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.000
Devotee who burns

c02ced7c-01c7-4dc3-ac27-353b29db777c-0
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.680
will die soon

766668c5-ed99-4421-822d-7854c2d6709e-0
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.794
simply because he burns up the karmic material, but he does not

766668c5-ed99-4421-822d-7854c2d6709e-1
00:20:44.794 --> 00:20:45.820
slow down the body.

8c4239c8-ff04-4ff3-aff4-282b37ea2589-0
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.049
If you Fast forward other dimensions of who you are, you

8c4239c8-ff04-4ff3-aff4-282b37ea2589-1
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.840
need to slow down the body.

60d1c895-bf55-462d-9a28-e82bd3a90f27-0
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.520
It's very important.

3c81fadd-b17b-4d68-b98e-70c505f523ea-0
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.256
So this is what sadhana is about. On one level,

3c81fadd-b17b-4d68-b98e-70c505f523ea-1
00:20:59.256 --> 00:21:02.729
physiologically you are trying to slow down all other

3c81fadd-b17b-4d68-b98e-70c505f523ea-2
00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:04.979
dimensions. You want Fast forward.

36a7c0cb-246a-4fea-bfb6-7b4f045197ee-0
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.950
This traditionally is called Yatana.

20024150-f064-46a9-b42b-daedb4f7c986-0
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.596
When it happens very intensely, we call it bhairavi yatana. No,

20024150-f064-46a9-b42b-daedb4f7c986-1
00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:16.270
I'm not talking about marriage.

42f1a1e0-7196-4a78-80e5-605503b8b3f7-0
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.790
Yatana means a certain amount of struggle, a certain amount of

26c8b94d-5861-4b26-897b-63641c1cbcd9-0
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.680
intensity of struggle.

be3fd677-8d7e-43b6-9622-65a8d1759dfd-0
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.380
Because you put everything on Fast forward.

32a36852-d7c2-4566-99fe-c317c9e7ab86-0
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.133
If it went slow, you wouldn't feel it so much. Because now

32a36852-d7c2-4566-99fe-c317c9e7ab86-1
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:45.280
everything is on Fast forward. Everything is intense. Pleasure

32a36852-d7c2-4566-99fe-c317c9e7ab86-2
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.163
is intense. Pain is intense. Joe is intense. Everything is

32a36852-d7c2-4566-99fe-c317c9e7ab86-3
00:21:49.163 --> 00:21:49.689
intense.

4d175d66-6451-455f-aad3-8ab01994d97e-0
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.680
For this it is best to slow down the system physical system.

132d74d5-41ee-4d33-9567-211d6040b5fd-0
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.440
Then it will become very productive.

8122f91e-9742-4139-a966-ab360323da50-0
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.210
It will become a tremendous potential

4d4c396b-a994-4502-a1ec-f8ad5ab579fb-0
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.330
circular because you slow down the physiological system to

4d4c396b-a994-4502-a1ec-f8ad5ab579fb-1
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.100
accommodate

aeb3b0ac-e8e5-4b2a-9401-46efff12fffd-0
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.710
a very intense dense.

5bd823c1-cb85-46d5-a9a0-7600d8713493-0
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.116
If you want to dance very intensely, the stage must be

5bd823c1-cb85-46d5-a9a0-7600d8713493-1
00:22:16.116 --> 00:22:16.590
stable,

4acb94cd-d5db-49c3-957c-4074c3d444d5-0
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.750
otherwise

8f8d0dad-5f6e-4974-952d-ff3e26ebabab-0
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.080
you may go through.
