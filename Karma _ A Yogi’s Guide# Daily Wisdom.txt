A book on karma has been overdue because the word karma has gone everywhere in the world,
become part of almost every language.
But what karma means, the level of misunderstanding and misinterpretation of this word is phenomenal.
So I thought it's time to release a book on karma as a guide to craft one's destiny.
Karma is not about punishment and reward, karma is not about being sinful or virtuous,
karma is about understanding the legacy of information that comes with our birth and continues
through our life, enhances itself to various levels and impacts every dimension of our
experience.
The word karma literally means action, that means as the action that you perform becomes
more and more conscious, your destiny also will become a more conscious possibility.
That means essentially you are going where you want in your life.
For most human beings, socially, career-wise they may be going where they want reasonably,
but in their experience of life a whole lot of human beings are not going that way.
The level of suffering that one creates within oneself is largely because we are attributing
our experience to various things.
Karma means action, action means my doing.
So my life is my karma essentially means I am the maker of my life.
So this book explores step by step possibility of how you can take out of your destiny, how
you can craft your destiny by being conscious about various levels of karma that you perform
in terms of physical activity, mental activity, emotional energy activity, karma is being
accumulated.
If you bring the light of consciousness into these aspects, how this can be transformed,
the methods and the possibilities and the consequences of this, this is what the book
explores, it's my wish and my blessing that every human being should be able to craft
their own destiny.
