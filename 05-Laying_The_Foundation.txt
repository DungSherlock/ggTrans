Within me there was this turmoil going on.
In me I was saying that I should go full time with Sadhguru.
But there were no people around him full time, especially girls.
So when I first spoke about it to Sadhguru, he said, don't be in a hurry.
So Viji was next to him and she said, Jagi, what is she talking about?
She wants to come full time, how is it possible?
Look at her family.
Then I tried to convince Viji.
I said, no, it is really important to me.
Then she said, Kusum, you come and stay with me for a few days in my house.
You first understand, you seems to be in a hurry.
So that is the time when they were trying to have a house at Koyamatore.
I think till then it was all a temporary arrangement.
They moved to Koyamatore where our Singhanalur office is right now in Koyamatore.
So they moved there, I think Viji took a break from her job.
Sadhguru's work started more intensely when he came to Koyamatore.
And his mission was larger and he had a tendency to finish something.
These are very initial tender moments of Yishaya Yoga Centre where Viji as a person was more confined to Sadhguru as a husband.
From what Viji shared with me, initially she was not happy with Sadhguru's decision to set up an ashra.
Because she felt that between them they didn't need anybody else.
She said our life is very good with each other.
And I think Sadhguru also took some time to explain things to her.
And I was on the other side because we wanted an ashram where we can come and stay and live and grow.
When the three centers were at full swing, Kirtguru, Koyamatore and Irood, Karur also, we requested him to starve our own place and other things.
No, he said no.
After that second Samima, he also experienced a different aspect.
And Viji, all done again.
Viji Yamal also experienced something.
Mahakarapuri also experienced something.
And that Samima was very great change.
But he's 90 to September October.
One in Sirood was like, Jaiji almost became lifeless in one Samima single.
In which Viji Yamal was also a participant, because he missed the first and the second she did not completely grasp it.
So she insisted the third to happen.
So at the time of night dinner, he'll sit in a place and keep the plate and ask for him.
He'll whisper.
The first day, similarly, went and kept the Kanji plate near before him and asked for him.
And what happened is he fell at me lap and he was in Samadhi.
Everybody was agitated.
Somebody was looking, shall we call a doctor and all those things going on.
No, I know, because already I witnessed him going into Samadhi before him.
So I simply, I was with him.
Viji was there.
Viji was just sitting and she never perturbed, you know, when they just used to do things.
Fifty sandwiches, it was just lifeless.
Time passed.
It crossed 40 minutes.
Viji Yamal is seen in going to Samadhi between 30 to 30 minutes.
So she was also bit worried.
She started chanting, and about 40 to 40th minute with a lot of tears from his eyes and breathing, he came out of Samadhi.
Immediately looking at Viji Yamal and asked me, why did they break the silence?
Asked them to shut them out.
Then I asked him, shall I cancel the next session of Sammima?
No.
You give me a long card with my...
I will lay down and give instruction.
And he said, after the prayer he said, watch your breath.
People were watching the breath in different ways.
Somewhere roaring, somewhere I slightly come into the daias.
On our rivals, tumbling.
Then we were consecrating Jana Linga.
Initially I wanted 14 people.
The Sammima was crafted the way it is today in pursuit of those 14 people.
I was looking for them.
And we simply sat here.
There would be, if there are 500 people, there would be at least 120 people who crawling around like snakes.
As closed, not using their limbs, but they will find their way through.
Without opening their eyes, without touching anybody, they will just come.
The end of one hour session, there will be at least 60, 70, one on top of the other, all piled up like this.
In front of the daias, telling me it's me, it's me.
I said, no, no, not you, not you, not you.
So we thought, if we have 14 people, it would be easy if all of them were men to work with.
It would be easy to work with men.
But to find men like that, who have capabilities of being both masculine and feminine within themselves, is difficult.
So initially I looked only for men.
Then when I found, we couldn't catch them.
Then I said, okay, seven men and seven women.
They'll take the social risk.
Then we went through that, we picked many, we put them to processes and that was a time when so many things were done which are very difficult to describe.
From there I just boiled down to just two that I can work with.
In only next class question, I was able to say why these things are happening because many people fast forward at their life and he looked at Vijayama.
So that was my view.
That was the first disolving of karma, Viji, Amma, to place.
And immediately asked me to come and said, we'll visit auditor.
Then we visited and then he said, I want to form a foundation in the name of Isha foundation.
And then we went through the name of Isha.
Also, Sadhguru at that time had a farmhouse in Mysore which he wanted to sell and he wanted to fund the purchase of the land for this ashram.
So she had this insecurity that any housewife, any mother would have that, okay, we can leave our life whichever we want to live.
But for our daughter, it's us we have to provide for her.
So this is the only property that is left with us and if we give this away, what will happen to Radeh?
She relented only for the reason because Sadhguru wanted it.
Another thing was like this.
People would ask us, how can you allow him to do this?
He's doing this, this, this, this and you.
This will mean your family will be gone, everything will be gone.
She would just look like that and say, if he's doing it, it must be right.
This is her logic.
That's all her logic was.
And it worked out wonderfully well for her, okay.
Everybody thought she's a fool.
But she turned out to be the smartest one.
Her logic is just this.
If he's doing it, it must be right.
This comes after many, many, many experiences which blow away your logic.
Then we were finding a place, suitable place for the foundation and some people near Polnace said, we will give 100 acres.
Then he said, no man, myself and Vijay, we'll agree.
And when they returned back at one point or on place, I could not move.
Physically, I cannot move the place from the place.
And Vijay, he pushed me and pulled me and then only we are able to prove.
So that place has got connection with us.
So kindly, if you can, inquire about the place you do it.
That is the place where the handling is now.
Her involvement for any positive things are always full.
So Bill the ashram, she was the one who gave the bangle first.
We were all there, first as a donation.
That's where it all started.
Then the donation slowly flowed in.
We bought the first piece of land which was 14 acres of land we bought and we did Bhumi
Pooja on this land which happened on 23rd of November, 1993.
I remember that day because it happened to be my birthday.
So we came here and we did Bhumi Pooja where Vijay did the Guru Pooja for the land.
Maybe not the very first trip that we took to see the ashram land.
It was so windy and I remember having to hold on to my father's kurta and my mother was there and I too.
Hold on to them because I thought I would fly away in the wind and the ashram which was not really the ashram then it was just a piece of land and nothing had started there.
When the ashram started, when we all left our comfortable zone, society, family, when we came here with the minimum facility in the ashram, life was little barren.
It was Viji's presence that gave us a feeling of little home.
And we had an elaborate discussion about the formation of ashram not in Kaimatore.
It was in Malpia Island at Toronto and here in Malgore.
Myself, my wife, all the teachers are family and the boat lived.
It's a small island, a prepared cook, tea, sausinti.
It was raining, we had to be there.
And in that beach only how the ashram should be.
And Dijayakav was very fighting for each and everything.
This should be like this, this should be like this.
She had her own perspective about things, a different perspective.
And I was marveled at times how deep her understanding of certain aspect was.
Like initially Brahmacharya was band-aid tree, whoever want to come full-time, they have to take Brahmacharya.
This Viji found, Brahmacharya is not for all.
She said, Sahaja
Everybody can't be Brahmacharya.
There are different types of people.
But he said, I want only that kind, we can go into Brahmacharya.
Then she sat and gave her point of view.
You mean to say a person who can't take Brahmacharya, can't he achieve?
Does he have a possibility?
Yes, Viji, he has a possibility.
Then why deny opportunity to all those people here?
I think we can't close doors on anybody, whoever wants spirituality, this place should be open for them, whatever their limitation is.
She had a very strong point and I remember that evening where she was without losing her cool.
Her mind was raised by Sadhguru, she had a reply.
She was very firm, very clear and certain experience of life she had when certain place you have to come from to have that view, she had that.
And first Brahmacharya, we can give Brahmacharya Guru Sushi a barambhaya can be given, got the consent of Viji in that place.
Immediately after coming over then, the first batch of Brahmacharya was given on the night of Shuratri.
She was beginning to get involved in small ways with the ashram.
But when Sadhguru announced the Holness program, by then I think her leave Kota was over and she had to go back and she could not even participate in Holness program.
As much as she wanted to be there, she could not come because she had to go back to the
PNOPopedï¿½ as she coupiis-deposi- team which Notably was theWebCriticressor and she decided when she was 10 or 1000 people she wanted to receive or online.
