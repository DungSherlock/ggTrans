00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:20.747
How many people have reached enlightenment 
through these processes that you offer?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.244
So he wants an assurance

00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:37.245
does this really work?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.222
Many

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:50.750
many many,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.080
but at the same time

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.840
realization is one thing

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.781
understanding the mechanics of 
what life is is another thing,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.000
that needs learning that's like study that's 
like understanding this one this box or this box  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.173
you have to understand realizing 
my nature is a different dimension  

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.703
learning to fix this one is different isn't it? 
Can Gautam Buddha fix this tape recorder

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:35.462
He cannot fix it isn't it?

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:43.026
A local guy who has been trained 
for six months to do this job, he can just fix it.

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:46.647
So this is a different area altogether.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:50.000
So similarly the body is a different area altogether,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.484
realization spiritual dimension of realization 
is different,

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:59.044
fixing the body is different.

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:06.134
But once somebody is fully realized and naturally,

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:11.565
there is nothing to hold on to the body because
there's nothing to stay in the body.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:15.175
There's no stuff to stay,

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:18.720
so he has to learn tricks to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.884
keep the body.

00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:23.791
Learning those tricks will take time

00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:30.093
because that is a learning process 
 realization is instantaneous

00:02:30.093 --> 00:02:36.824
learning is not instantaneous one 
has to learn isn't it?

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:43.194
Because of this we break down many people in the last step.

00:02:43.194 --> 00:02:46.623
Because we want their physical bodies 
to run their course.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.422
Otherwise I would have people popping around 
me every day,

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.000
handling these bodies will 
become a big problem

00:02:56.388 --> 00:03:00.216
 I don't want to have those bodies 
 on my hand in today's society

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.047
This is like you know what's 
a snake in the ladder game?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.920
The snake in the ladder game 
if you put through the dice  

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.478
six means you hit the ladder 
zoom went up

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.920
then you put two you hit the snake 
doom you came down this process goes  

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.433
on and on some people never make 
it it just goes on and on and on.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.099
But if you manage to reach to the last line 
after that there are no snakes anymore

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.445
all you have to do is one, one, one, one, one, 
it's just a question of time.

00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:42.677
But there's no question of falling down.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.734
We have pushed lots of people to that stage

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:50.537
there's no question of them falling down, 

00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:56.757
but they're not enlightened they can be as stupid as 
anybody but they can't fall down.  

00:03:56.757 --> 00:03:59.118
Because now the all they have to do is

00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:04.230
just keep throwing the dice one, 
one is not going to come because of your skill

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.438
it comes once in a way you just wait

00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:13.938
one, one, one, one, one,

00:04:13.938 --> 00:04:18.102
when you put the last one it's done 
but the important thing is

00:04:18.102 --> 00:04:20.980
no more snakes to swallow you down

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.268
no more snakes to tempt you with the apple

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:35.120
 This is just like that if you just 
drop this one calculation what can i get  

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.800
after that no more snakes it is just 
a question of time you will get that.  

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.345
In everything in your life what can I get is 
dropped means you will become   

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:55.284
really boundless and absolutely compassionate
 in your life there is no other way  

00:04:55.284 --> 00:04:58.595
you just have to drop this one simple calculation

00:04:58.595 --> 00:05:00.550
because

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.600
that is the key to your whole mind 
 and your mental process

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.137
that is the key to all the activity that's 
happening in the mind

00:05:08.137 --> 00:05:11.291
you just pull the plug it's over.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.781
So we have many like that,

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:26.248
we don't name them.

00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:30.742
You don't go looking for them they may be in 
most odd places,

00:05:30.742 --> 00:05:36.455
they're not the people you think they may 
be most probably but there are many people

00:05:36.455 --> 00:05:40.681
who are in that kind of place who are in a certain way.

00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:48.015
So if we allow people to go beyond a certain band

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.979
either they leave the body or

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.963
they cannot you know

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.784
maintain their normal course 
of what they're doing.

00:06:05.784 --> 00:06:10.160
So we always pick them down on the last step,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.960
so that they enjoy a certain 
blissfulness they have a certain balance  

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.383
and they become useful.

00:06:17.383 --> 00:06:21.356
They are like castrated bulls

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.680
I'm using a very negative example.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.151
I always use negative examples so 
that your imagination doesn't go wild.

00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:35.840
Okay.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.505
So that you can tie them to the cart 
and make them work and

00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:49.464
all this so that they can be useful to the world 
because anyway the physical body is intact

00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:53.814
realization has come within I feel we must put it to use.

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:58.747
The world was all in great bliss 
this was not necessary would just pop them.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.372
But the world is not like that, world is in huge 
misery when it's like this i feel we must harness it.  

00:07:07.372 --> 00:07:12.605
 Even if it means a certain limitation 
because anyway his realization is assured.  

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:18.720
He's reached a point where there's no 
going back there's no falling back anymore  

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.110
so let him serve for some time isn't it?

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.226
Is it okay? 
 You don't like it?

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.745
I think it's okay.

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:30.306
Lot of people wouldn't approve this,

00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:34.801
but i think it's all right because 
it's very essential in the world.

00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:38.389
The world was doing great 
this wouldn't be necessary.

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:40.914
The world is not doing great,

00:07:40.914 --> 00:07:46.153
human beings are not doing great, 
you know they're going through enormous nonsense.

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:53.327
If we create more and more people like 
this then definitely it'll be a better place.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.297
So as these methods worked

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.668
hugely, wonderfully.

00:08:03.668 --> 00:08:05.659
Now

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:06.936
how many people got there here?

00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:11.268
Many, but we don't allow them to go there because

00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:19.080
then you will create a lots of bodies the way 
our people go because it's a very short span

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.903
without any sadhana they're jumping like this their energies

00:08:21.903 --> 00:08:27.094
why people are jumping I want you to understand.

00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:31.105
Something within you has 
overtaken your body.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.000
the body is growing at a certain pace,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.920
body is in a certain level of evolution

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:45.080
but the energy has evolved much more so the 
body cannot hold it's trying to jump out.  

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.762
That's all that's happening,

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:55.166
if the body also, if you worked sufficiently to create a body 
also which is suitable for this kind of energy

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:57.470
then you would simply sit.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.081
No matter how intense this gets,

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:07.840
 but the necessary body is not there 
that means you have mutated you did not evolve.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.853
Evolution would take a long time

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:17.183
we are doing mutation that's why 
so much jumping around

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.699
people are advancing too fast

00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:27.444
so we have to pick 
them down otherwise they'll blow.

00:09:27.444 --> 00:09:30.923
When we start the process itself we peg you down

00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:37.247
not later, well suppose you forget 
there's no such thing.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.529
There is no such thing.

00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:46.011
Nobody will leave accidentally, 
it cannot happen.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.182
With Viji it happened because we 
allowed it because   

00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:58.075
the nature of the consecration was such 
we allowed that aspect,

00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:01.920
otherwise we couldn't do that kind of work.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.804
So now also we're doing certain things

00:10:06.804 --> 00:10:11.207
which involve that kind of energy and 
involvement

00:10:11.207 --> 00:10:12.308
but

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:19.239
when we do such things we are making sure the 
people involved have the necessary discipline,

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:20.640
 enormous discipline,  

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.001
an absolute, absolute obedience

00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:28.168
this moment they're doing something 
if it is going to a certain point if I say no.

00:10:28.168 --> 00:10:31.809
It's no, no question about why, 
how, this, that,

00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:34.720
only then you can take that risk

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.804
there are people they're wonderful people 
like that we are doing certain things now
