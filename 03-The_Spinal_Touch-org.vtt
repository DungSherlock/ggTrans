00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000


00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.000
This could be understood and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.960
and misunderstood in many different ways.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.840
For many of you who are here,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.320
for almost

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.360
all the Isha meditators around the world,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.840
whatever is happening with them

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.400
in terms of energy…

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920
First of all you need to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.800
make a distinction between 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.320
talking spirituality

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.120
and actually making something happen

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.680
with your life process.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.520
There is a psychological process,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.360
there is an existential process.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.720
Now, I can open the Bhagavad Gita or

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.320
The Bible or some other book

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.400
and read it to you

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.040
and explain meanings to you,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.080
tell stories to you

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.040
which can set off a whole range of
psychological process.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.040
It can… At the most, if at all,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.520
if you can call it that,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.280
at the most it is preparatory in nature.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760
By itself there is nothing spiritual about

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.400
listening to a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.680
discourse or a book or reading a book

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.120
or writing a book or anything.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.960
It is purely a psychological process.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.800
You have not set off any spiritual process

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.680
because spirituality is purely existential.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.880
Psychological process is what you do in your head.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.560
You can do whatever you want in your head

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.240
and it need not have anything to do with reality.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.920
You can sit here

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.560
and think whatever you want.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.560
It need not have anything to do

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.040
with the existing reality as such.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.600
Spiritual process is purely existential.
What you think, 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
your belief systems, your ideologies,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.360
your philosophies,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.120
your opinions have no place on the spiritual path.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.880
So,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.273
we

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.200
used Isha Yoga

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.880
as an effective tool

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.960
to level people's mind.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.840
It rolls you down pretty well, hmm?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.960
And in that moment of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.480
little bit of openness in the psychological process

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.760
we did touch your spine.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.160
So,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.520
whatever is happening around us

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.120
in the form of programs, 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.200
in the form of whatever else

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.200
is not because of the teaching,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.440
please see this.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.120
What we are teaching

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.720
and what is happening to people

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.120
actually is very contradictory. 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.200
We are talking about yoga.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.480
We are talking about

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.600
peace,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.160
inclusion

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.360
or we are talking about Shoonya, emptiness

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.160
but what's happening is a scream.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.440
very contradictory.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.520
Because the talk,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.480
the Isha Yoga program and its content

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.400
is only a device

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.000
to level out

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.040
the resistance that is there
in the psychological process.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.480
To make you feel like a fool

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.160
so that

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.240
you don't attach yourself to your ideas

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.680
and values and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.760
whatever nonsense you believe in.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.000
The moment you do not identify yourself with that,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.880
there is an opening.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.680
The moment that openness happens

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.320
your spinal thread will not be spared,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.880
have no hope about that.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.120
It will not be spared.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.120
It will immediately be touched.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.920
Whether you let it glow

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.600
or you resist 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.560
and create more heat than light is up to you.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.240
If you know electrical devices,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.360
the more resistance there is in a wire

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.680
through which electricity is passing,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.360
more heat is generated, less light.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.520
Less resistance,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.960
then less heat and more light.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.680
That's up to you.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.880
That's in your hands.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.640
It's been touched,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.880
the power is on.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.520
If you resist

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.920
you create more heat and less light.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.400
If you don't resist

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.440
you will create lot of light and very little heat.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.560
So,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.320
if you want to cultivate this further

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.360
that your glow is not just for your transformation,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.840
you want it

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.640
so that we can get rid of the light bulbs

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.280
and save on power

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.360
and do something ecologically good also.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.760
If you want to go that far,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.000
then yes you have to pay lot of attention to it,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.600
lot of attention.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.960
If you want to become an alternative source

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.360
of energy on this planet

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.200
you have to pay lot of attention to it.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.520
A lot means lot.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.320
But you cannot pay a lot of attention

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.160
 lot of attention to anything

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.560
because you can only pay

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.920
what you have.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.320
But in that also you are saving,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.560
that's not okay.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.960
Everything that you have you pay,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.320
that's still not enough because

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.560
that's not all what you have.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.720
There is more

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.200
but that's still

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.520
redundant, it's not it.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.000
it is still

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.560
in an un-manifest state.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.560
It is still in a state where
you don't have access to it.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.040
I am just talking even about
your mental attention.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.520
All of your mental attention
is not there right now, please see.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.040
At different times of your life in the day,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.320
at different times of the day

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.240
you are at different levels of attention, isn't it?

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.320
If you are doing your work
you are in one level of attention,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.320
if you are doing in meditation

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.880
you are in different level of attention,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.960
you are eating something that you like very much

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.400
you are in a different level of attention,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.263
you are watching

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.280
a video something that you like

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.880
you are in a different level of attention.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.200
Now, you are in a

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.000
different level of attention.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.600
So, your levels of attention

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.880
you yourself know it's different

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.720
and whatever the peak attention

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.920
that you have had in your life at any time,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.480
whatever that was,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.880
that is still not all of it.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.120
That is just a small part of it.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.320
You are capable of much more attention,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.400
much much more.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.960
Suppose I put you in a place,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.480
right now suppose I leave you

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.520
in the middle of Velliangiri Mountains

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.200
where it's pitch dark

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.760
without a torch or anything, 

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.280
if you hear wild animals and anything and you

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.960
can't see anything,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.920
now you will be in a different level of attention.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.160
If it's question of life and death

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.720
now you will become attentive
in a completely different way.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.040
A few years ago

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.520
when we were a small group of people here, 

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.640
I took them on a trek,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.200
on a railway track

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.680
between Subramanya and Mangalore

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.480
where

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.360
this 36-kilometer stretch

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.880
has over 300 bridges

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.240
and over 100 tunnels.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.320
Practically you are either on a bridge or in a tunnel

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.800
most of the time,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.280
and it's wonderful,
absolutely wonderful mountain.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.800
Some of the tunnels are over a kilometer long. 

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.280
If you go into it in the night,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.440
even in the day it is pitch dark.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.520
If you go into it it's absolutely dark means dark.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.840
You can't see your hand like this.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.280
After some time you don't know
whether your eyes are open or closed. 

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.000
It's that dark.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.960
Absolutely dark,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.520
probably many of you have never been in a place

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.960
like that because wherever you are there is some light,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.560
you know.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.520
Even the star light something.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.560
It's giving you some sense of vision.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.480
Absolutely no vision,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.400
pitch black

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.920
in front of you.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.240
If you look like this you don't know

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.160
whether your hand is there or not.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.280
Really after some time you start wondering

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.120
whether your eyes are closed or open because

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.120
it doesn't make any difference.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.440
Even the slightest difference is not there.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.120
So, I made them walk through these tunnels

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.840
without any torches or anything.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.840
On the railway track it is, you know,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.960
you don't know there could be a ditch,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.320
there could be an opening,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.920
there could be anything
and the bats are flying all over.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.600
They don't see anything either

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.200
but they are damn sure where they are going,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200
you know?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.760
They are just flying really close to you
all over the place.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.560
Initially people were so terrified

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.800
but after some time slowly they started walking,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.600
walking and enjoying the whole experience.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.600
If you are in a place like that

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.400
your attention becomes

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.884
really heightened.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.480
If you can keep your attention

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.680
like this every moment of your life

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.680
then you will glow,

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.480
really glow.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.920
Why

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.760
I am always constantly,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.120
especially with the brahmacharis

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.200
I am

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.480
constantly pushing them to notice little,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.720
little things in the ashram

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.960
is because

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.560
not just about cleanliness,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.480
not just about the aesthetics of the place,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.469
just to be attentive,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.680
to be absolutely attentive

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.440
to every little thing.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.680
If a pebble has turned over,
you must notice it,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.640
you know.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.400
Yesterday the pebble was like this,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.320
today if it is like this,

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.040
you must notice it.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.680
It is not the question of the pebble,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.920
how the pebble is.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.360
It is just that you are attentive.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.640
If you bring this attention to a peak,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.080
then

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.760
whatever your spinal thread that has been touched,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.880
it will really glow.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.360
It's been touched.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.600
No question about that.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.560
You have to make it glow,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.520
you have to pay attention.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.640
If you learn to

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.760
have a heightened sense of attention, 

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.160
then we can teach you methods

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.280
as to what you must attend to

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.720
and what you should not within you.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.240
Right now, just we are still working on people

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.560
to get them to a certain level of attention.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.640
If you become very attentive we can look at

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.440
how to make use of that attentiveness.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.197
It is...

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.440
Only when you truly pay attention

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.880
to your life first of all, 

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.200
you understand

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.360
how limited

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.560
and how baseless life is. 

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.240
That's the first step towards spirituality

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.520
happens only because you paid attention

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.680
to your life 

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.760
and you saw

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.920
you don't know where it begins, 

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.240
you don't know where it ends.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.280
You are going about as if

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.440
whatever you are doing
is a be all and end all of life.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.960
The moment you pay a little attention

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.520
you understand, This is not it.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.960
So, the very first step of even

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.840
thinking spiritual came to you 

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.720
only because of a certain level of attention.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.760
If you pay much more attention to everything,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.160
above all if you heighten your ability

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.600
to be attentive,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.640
that could be used in miraculous ways,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.720
miraculous ways.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.880
It could really create an alternative source of energy.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.480
Yes...
