1
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,640
Is there a way to do lucid dreaming, 

2
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,360
where 

3
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,920
as I fall

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,360
asleep and shift into a dream state,

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,800
I still retain awareness?

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,440
Well, 

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,720
that's only where you wish to fly,

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,960
it's up to you, 

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
but I want you to understand that 

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
the word dream means it's not real. 

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,120
That's what the word dream 

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,440
or the word Swapna means 

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,680
it's not real. 

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,680
A whole lot of people, especially children, 

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,400
children between, 

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,120
I would say, eight to fourteen years of age, 

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,760
have a tendency to do this 

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,320
that some of these children dream 

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,080
very strong when they're awake. 

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,840
Has it happened to you 

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,120
when you were that age? 

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,040
When eight

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,920
to fourteen years of age, 

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
when your intelligence is blossoming, 

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,440
but you're not yet 

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,640
hijacked by your hormones,

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,800
there is a strong tendency to dream strong. 

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,440
A child will simply sit like this, and

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,920
if he reads a story or 

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
sees a movie or something else 

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,440
somebody told him, 

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,200
he will just 

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,760
create a reality with that. 

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
Well, 

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,640
this can... 

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,760
you know, I've seen this with children,

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,320
and I've 

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,600
made efforts to disturb that dream 

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,280
always 

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
because 

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,040
this can...  

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,040
First of all, we need to understand this mechanism 

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
is so subtle.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,160
Anything that subtle 

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,040
it robust also but 

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,920
anything that is subtle 

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,680
always has a certain sense

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,440
of fragility attached to it. 

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,560
So we must understand 

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
our sanity, 

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,800
for every one of us 

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
I'm saying, our sanity is not a guarantee. 

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,600
Like your health is not a guarantee. 

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
Just because 

55
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,920
you're eating proper food, 

56
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,160
you're doing the right thing,

57
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
it doesn't mean 

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,760
for your life you will be healthy. 

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, largely we can take care, 

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,040
but there is no guarantee. 

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
People who are doing everything right, 

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
get unhealthy, 

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,320
get all kinds of diseases. 

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,240
So, similarly,

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,000
your sanity is not an assured 

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,720
dimension of life.

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,960
It needs to be kept carefully. 

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,440
One must guard 

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,000
to ensure 

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
that we don't go off, 

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,800
into that. 

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
So, 

73
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,160
giving too much significance 

74
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
to dream and making it 

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,040
more and more real in your experience

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,720
is like pushing the line of sanity. 

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,080
Well, you may not cross, 

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,000
but there's no guarantee you will not.

79
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
You could. 

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,520
Many people do. 

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
You must understand this... 

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,200
I've seen, 

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,520
you know, some of my... during... 

84
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,200
when I was a youth, 

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
boys who are around 

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,880
me were normal, 

87
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,000
perfectly normal in every way. 

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,960
Suddenly after three months, the guy has gone crazy. 

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,640
In six months he commits suicide. He dies.

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,240
Perfectly normal guy. 

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
He has no great issues in his life, 

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,160
nothing, the usual things, whatever  

93
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,600
young people, but nothing. 

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,680
There are no drugs, 

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
there is no alcohol, there is no anything. 

96
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
But perfectly normal person 

97
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,960
when he flips into insanity, 

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,920
you don't know, 

99
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,880
because 

100
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,800
it's a very fragile privilege 

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
that you have 

102
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,560
to be perfectly sane 

103
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,560
in every given situation. 

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
There are people who are sane 

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
when situations are sane, 

106
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,840
if situation goes little crazy, 

107
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,080
they will all go crazy. 

108
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,880
There's a whole lot of people like that.

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,920
You just have to...

110
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,240
You know that snake around Adiyogi? 

111
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,520
If it comes alive and just comes here, 

112
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
you will see how many people are crazy, 

113
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,400
how many people are sane 

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,680
Hello? Lucid dream 

115
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
So if outside situations go off 

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
the track, 

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,080
you will also go off

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,480
because 

119
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,920
sanity is a very fragile privilege.

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
We must hold it on 

121
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,520
as a very precious, valuable privilege. 

122
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,880
Because 

123
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,400
once you lose it, 

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,160
we've lost all our faculties 

125
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,520
everything that we have, we've lost. 

126
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
So 

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,680
this lucid dreaming 

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,720
and, you know, you can fly,  

129
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,840
you can become this, you can become that,

130
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,360
well, comes from the Native American culture. 

131
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,280
It's all over the place today in America. 

132
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,920
A whole lot of people are doing 

133
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,280
other kinds of plants, herbs, 

134
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,000
herbs, 

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
stuff, roots, box, whatever 

136
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,440
to get lucid dreams. 

137
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,800
I would say don't. 

138
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,760
But you can't stop 

139
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,160
people from dreaming. 

140
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,280
I have a dream.

141
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,600
Yes, I have a dream. 

142
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Now, 

143
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,640
if 

144
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,960
dreams are becoming like reality, 

145
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
you must watch out, 

146
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,280
because one day 

147
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,920
you will not know the distinction. 

148
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,680
One day when you do not know the distinction, 

149
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,160
people will experience you as insane.

150
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,840
You may think you're perfectly fine, 

151
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,120
but the world 

152
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,360
will experience you as insane. 

153
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
This has happened 

154
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,480
to a lot of people 

155
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
on the spiritual path

156
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,840
also. 

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,200
Without doing any drugs, 

158
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,840
without doing any chemicals, nothing. 

159
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,360
Simply 

160
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,720
devotees drive themselves up. 

161
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,680
We are 

162
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,080
doing devotion here 

163
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,200
in a controlled, stable way.

164
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,960
It's very important. 

165
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,720
We are not doing boom 

166
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,600
kind of devotion 

167
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,280
which exists in India as a cult, 

168
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,800
that they are like 

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,480
fantastic people,

170
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,280
but they're crazy. 

171
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,600
They will not do anything 

172
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,280
effectively in their life, 

173
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,480
but

174
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,400
like this 

175
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,520
if they sit like this only

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,600
no drug, 

177
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,520
nothing, simply 

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,360
because lucid dreams. 

179
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,760
And once 

180
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,120
there is not enough stability in your energy system,

181
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,040
if dream becomes too strong, 

182
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,200
then you will know no distinction

183
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
between 

184
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,560
what is eyes open, what is eyes closed. 

185
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,000
This distinction 

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,240
is very important

187
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,720
eyes open, eyes closed. 

188
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,320
This distinction you must check. 

189
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,360
If this distinction is becoming thin, 

190
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,400
you must know 

191
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
your line of sanity is very thin, 

192
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,520
very thin. 

193
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,520
So 

194
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,320
the simple thing that everybody could do is...

195
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,840
See, if you can just 

196
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,560
lie down on your back 

197
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,560
for most part of the night.

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,560
Simple.

199
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,720
That much practice you do. 

200
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
With the Sadhana... 

201
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,400
If you're doing enough yogic Sadhana,

202
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,920
slowly

203
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,480
these things may evolve by itself.

204
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,640
Well, 

205
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,480
not everybody 

206
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,160
may be able to lie down flat on their back 

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,920
for the entire night. 

208
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,080
But in my opinion, you should not be sleeping 

209
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,160
for the entire night. 

210
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,800
Sunset to sunrise is twelve hours.

211
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,680
A third of that is okay. 

212
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,520
A little more is okay 

213
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,840
but not entire night. If you're doing enough 

214
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,360
Sadhana, 

215
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,040
if you lie down on your back, 

216
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
then you will see

217
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
the problem 

218
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,160
is actually the pillow 

219
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,560
and your... maybe your bum. 

220
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,280
Two bumps, one here, one there.

221
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,400
So if 

222
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,640
pillow is 

223
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,280
you notice is the problem, reduce it, reduce it.

224
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,920
See if you can get rid of it. 

225
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,320
That's the best thing. 

226
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,160
About 

227
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,600
the shape of your body, 

228
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,040
all you have to do is, 

229
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,800
depending upon the shape of your body, 

230
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,480
accordingly 

231
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
you must adjust the angle of your legs. 

232
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,320
If you adjust the angle of your legs, 

233
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
the enhancement of body in certain ways

234
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,240
that is naturally there 

235
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,160
will be adjusted, 

236
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,800
and you can sleep on your back.

237
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,000
if you do this 

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,160
consciously 

239
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,280
at least for half the time that you sleep...

240
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Well,

241
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,280
you may achieve at least dreamless sleeps 

242
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,760
which is a good thing. 

243
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,840
It's called Sushupti, 

244
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,320
that means your... 

245
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,000
your sleep is such 

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,360
there is no rem, 

247
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,480
there is no dream, 

248
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,680
there is simply 

249
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
Every day you may not sleep like that. 

250
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,400
Some days 

251
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,040
some disturbances may happen, 

252
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,600
something may be happening somewhere,

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,080
something may... might have happened in your life. 

254
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,880
Something may happen, but 

255
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,280
there is no need for anybody to go to bed 

256
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,840
every day and every day have dreams. 

257
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,600
That means you're not in a very 

258
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,520
healthy condition. 

259
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,480
You're not in a good place. 

260
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,040
Once in a way some dream came, 

261
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,840
it doesn't matter. 

262
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,480
You don't have to give too much meaning to it. 

263
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,560
But every day if you're dreaming, 

264
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,800
one simple thing to do

265
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,880
is this 

266
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,520
that you lie down flat on your back and sleep. 

267
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,440
You will see 

268
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,280
you will breathe better. 

269
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,400
That means the life will happen better

270
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,120
in the system 

271
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,760
and all organs will work better. 

272
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,400
And also ensuring 

273
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
if you don't want to have 

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,720
unnecessary

275
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,680
dream's disturbances, 

276
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,640
you must eat at least four hours before you go to bed

277
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,960
minimum. 

278
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,320
Five to six hours is good. 

279
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,440
That is 

280
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,760
you are almost hungry 

281
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,720
before you go to bed, 

282
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,680
you just drink a glass of water 

283
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,840
and go to bed. 

284
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,440
Wow, 

285
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,280
you'll wake up early in the morning 

286
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,400
No dreams. 

287
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Simply sleep and wake up
