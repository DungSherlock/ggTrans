There was a karate master in Japan and he had a disciple.
One day this disciple seeks an appointment with the karate master and then asks,
why does my ability not improve?
You are over 70 years of age, I am 22, but still I can't kick like you or punch like you,
then the karate master asks the seagull when it is going into the sunset.
Have you seen the fire at the tip of the feathers?
He said, yes master, I have seen.
Then he asked, have you seen that golden line upon the peaks of the mountain
when the sun rises?
He said, yes master.
Have you seen the moon reflecting itself in the pond?
Yes master, definitely I have seen that also.
Then he said, that is the problem.
Stop watching all this shit and go on train.
So you need to understand behind every success there is a certain striving.
Different people throw different types of balls at you.
From all over your parents, your teachers, the school, the neighbors and the society and the world
throws all kinds of things at you, to gather all this muck and make something worthwhile out of yourself.
It's your business that your success.
