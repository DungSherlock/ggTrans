Sod Guru's scientific approach towards spirituality and work

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.450
The words that come from him in intensity and utmost clarity,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.872
Belonging to no particular tradition, Sadhguru incorporates

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:17.279

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.209
His work, An outpouring of his blissfulness, finds expression

Sadhguru's life is an invitation to the divine through individual transformation.

Always a manifold way in which people make use of the spiritual

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:18.000
processes for some people in many places.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.200
Spirituality and all this spiritual what?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.320
What do you call them?

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.920
What are those talks called in Hindi?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.800
Pravachans, all that pravachan, everything is just the escape from the mother-in-law or cooking.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.000
For some, it's an intellectual entertainment.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.640
For some, they are seeking to learn something.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.960
They want to know something new.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.560
A few people are wanting to, you know, bring about some changes in their life.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.228
They want to become little more peaceful, little more loving,

28988bb2-5101-4b81-9385-c5812ed0958b-1
00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:12.600
little more something else.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.040
Some change they want in their life.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.520
Some people are looking for transformation.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.440
You know the difference between change and transformation?

8990110c-8493-4eae-bf03-653a696bf67f-0
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.520
Hmm.

7bc7aa42-95d8-46e4-8866-b9cadf11c168-0
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.160
Transformation means nothing of the old should remain.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.560
Change means improvement, self improvement or transformation.

1265ba49-c56f-448d-a6a9-52cdda7d05e4-0
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.251
Or some people just try really wanting to get lost into it,

1265ba49-c56f-448d-a6a9-52cdda7d05e4-1
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.000
dissolve into it.

f6557745-51d2-48b7-a195-c8e83ee7019d-0
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.148
So many ways when people are approaching the same thing, it's

f6557745-51d2-48b7-a195-c8e83ee7019d-1
00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:59.040
a which is the best way.

ff99ccac-706d-4ef7-be7c-72c2b9885e6c-0
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.971
I wouldn't say which is the best way because according to each

ff99ccac-706d-4ef7-be7c-72c2b9885e6c-1
00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:07.560
person's needs, that's how they seek.

59edb67c-7c0f-4b0c-b0be-cdb84f97cc99-0
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.920
You can't prescribe the best way to anybody right now.

82b21248-8ba0-4935-960e-dcd6badaed91-0
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.829
Generally, the human nature is such that whatever they don't

82b21248-8ba0-4935-960e-dcd6badaed91-1
00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:27.120
have, that's what they will seek.

927e14a6-6cbf-4e07-9df3-2d831889be5c-0
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.840
They don't have health.

14275b21-176b-4f06-972e-4dbdc0614fb4-0
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.040
They're seeking health as if it's the ultimate thing.

77e074c9-c8e7-4034-802d-c436c57b75c4-0
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.201
If they don't have money, they're seeking money as if it's

77e074c9-c8e7-4034-802d-c436c57b75c4-1
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:37.000
the ultimate thing.

010953ac-54e1-4740-aabd-bb5e9ee837d3-0
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.168
If they don't have love, they're seeking love as if it's the

010953ac-54e1-4740-aabd-bb5e9ee837d3-1
00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:40.800
ultimate thing.

7590857f-c1a4-4c06-a12b-e3b77292a9f5-0
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.040
Whatever they don't have, that's what they're seeking.

136287e1-989e-45eb-b016-296299cde4b3-0
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.520
That reminds me, this happened when we were in Trichy.

e4078f3b-7cd6-40a5-b07e-b3444fa8d751-0
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.840
You know Trichy Sadhguru.

c6715e9c-6e5b-4a94-874c-896713f324fe-0
00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.776
Channapally, it's a medium sized town in Tamil Nadu in a high

c6715e9c-6e5b-4a94-874c-896713f324fe-1
00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:01.560
school.

49263809-1bca-4006-81ea-ad1a3d16b2d9-0
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.667
The teacher came and asked the students 8th or 9th, 7th

49263809-1bca-4006-81ea-ad1a3d16b2d9-1
00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:14.925
children, if God appears in front of you and gives you a

49263809-1bca-4006-81ea-ad1a3d16b2d9-2
00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:17.559
boon, what will you ask?

0ec8d0b4-63fc-4748-9841-5ccabadbfafb-0
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.800
One boy said.

ca6b50d3-136f-48d0-aa5c-b9d2fee36ca6-0
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.880
Those days you know Maruti car.

31bc2ba0-0c03-4584-bda2-a1f36b61a4f1-0
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.320
I want a Maruti car.

5fe5c0be-3a28-4907-9d68-294202c54368-0
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.200
Somebody said I want a bicycle.

b4111724-f718-4032-9dd8-d96b474374fd-0
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.072
Somebody said I want, you know,
â‚¹10,00,000 like this, they went

b4111724-f718-4032-9dd8-d96b474374fd-1
00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:35.280
on.

24ffd524-b8b6-492e-91af-a36ca201f9c6-0
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.400
Then the teacher said, You idiots, what will you do with

24ffd524-b8b6-492e-91af-a36ca201f9c6-1
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.760
all these things?

d1bd5567-722a-40c0-b009-9a79ea8d5c08-0
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.640
Ask for intelligence.

7eeebc18-7e63-408a-b0a8-7a26ac899c3b-0
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.320
Ask for knowledge, Ask for intelligence.

f2630946-6454-4136-82ee-fedfbd9326f6-0
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.560
Why are you asking for all these things?

9a4e9443-96c2-400e-a422-1d5b7d977801-0
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.626
So one boy stood up and said everybody asks for what they

9a4e9443-96c2-400e-a422-1d5b7d977801-1
00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.360
don't have.

e2546493-98a0-41fb-a0f1-f9d6081673c1-0
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.282
So everybody is seeking what they don't have, isn't it,

e2546493-98a0-41fb-a0f1-f9d6081673c1-1
00:06:17.282 --> 00:06:18.440
sadhguru?

520bf45f-f1ec-42db-bbdf-e3f4eed8bd92-0
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.460
Now if you go by this, when a human being goes by this process

520bf45f-f1ec-42db-bbdf-e3f4eed8bd92-1
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.002
of asking for what he doesn't have, then it's an endless

520bf45f-f1ec-42db-bbdf-e3f4eed8bd92-2
00:06:28.002 --> 00:06:28.640
process.

b1b1fb05-4278-404e-b334-03d98e859215-0
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.080
Because what is it that you have?

981e8ee1-dd12-4b15-b139-eca01608d17e-0
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.280
What you have is so little.

6c3504af-86dc-4846-ae39-04c7db07ff63-0
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.539
If you go on asking for what you don't have, you need 1000 years

6c3504af-86dc-4846-ae39-04c7db07ff63-1
00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.067
and still you will be nowhere If you start seeking the next thing

6c3504af-86dc-4846-ae39-04c7db07ff63-2
00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:45.439
that you don't have.

35c9e9fb-d3d9-4ff8-8a7c-36775136081d-0
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.600
It's an endless process, self defeating process isn't it?

636d59da-1c78-449f-850d-bb214b366412-0
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.578
It seems to be taking you somewhere, but it doesn't take

636d59da-1c78-449f-850d-bb214b366412-1
00:06:54.578 --> 00:06:55.240
you anywhere.

9f97e56a-5e4c-4e2d-8d87-0f4f497e40a3-0
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.040
So what is this about?

44b78217-3ae5-45ec-b3cc-82206f314c2a-0
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.534
If you don't seek, if there is no seeking, you don't go

44b78217-3ae5-45ec-b3cc-82206f314c2a-1
00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:09.760
anywhere you know.

c3b1fa1d-4318-41a3-a5fc-a29411e081e3-0
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.360
Why would you go to any place if there's nothing to seek?

db8060a2-2b07-4436-ab18-cdcb0382a5c1-0
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.160
Because that's a very basis of your activity.

5e3c802b-9080-42b6-b8c5-04243e77e8c0-0
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.720
Desiring and going after it, isn't it?

1173bba3-4b03-4d46-b539-c620c0bbca2b-0
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.535
The objects of desire may change, and people may think one

1173bba3-4b03-4d46-b539-c620c0bbca2b-1
00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:25.160
object is better than the other, but it's not.

b5077633-bce6-4d52-b9fa-2fde3c82d838-0
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.423
So whether you're seeking money or home, Oregon intelligence or

b5077633-bce6-4d52-b9fa-2fde3c82d838-1
00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:35.440
knowledge or God or this or that, desire is a desire I know.

4300b4fd-ba22-40e3-8868-16b017affa61-0
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.396
The object of desire just changes the directions of your

4300b4fd-ba22-40e3-8868-16b017affa61-1
00:07:40.396 --> 00:07:44.160
destination, but doesn't change the process of life as such.

0dd9dc03-b874-40ed-8c3b-43547e73cdf8-0
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.880
And the essence of life is in its process, isn't it?

cd25c45a-293d-4c73-b1de-fbce9cb9107e-0
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.720
Where you got in the end is not the point really.

b0606f43-f9cf-4763-bbef-3add7c4295be-0
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.089
In many ways right now, the essence of life is how you're

b0606f43-f9cf-4763-bbef-3add7c4295be-1
00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:02.120
experiencing it right now.

c87af509-1a89-4667-8ad9-dcfc17a1e22b-0
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.354
So one's quality of life, if you are changing or if you're

c87af509-1a89-4667-8ad9-dcfc17a1e22b-1
00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:12.645
wanting to experience life in a little better way or in a much

c87af509-1a89-4667-8ad9-dcfc17a1e22b-2
00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:17.684
better way, whatever, Changing the objects of desire is not

c87af509-1a89-4667-8ad9-dcfc17a1e22b-3
00:08:17.684 --> 00:08:20.959
going to make so much of a difference.

bc504941-a1fe-4395-8ab8-4aa88672cd04-0
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.946
It's the way we handle the process which is going to make

bc504941-a1fe-4395-8ab8-4aa88672cd04-1
00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:25.760
the difference.

d7af751f-7293-4e0d-ad35-2cceee7dca16-0
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.769
But even if life becomes very pleasant and beautiful

d7af751f-7293-4e0d-ad35-2cceee7dca16-1
00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:35.400
experience, it has to happen every human being.

a4614873-44e5-4588-b642-00767d6d16bc-0
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.174
But even if it happens, still you will see there is something

a4614873-44e5-4588-b642-00767d6d16bc-1
00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:45.180
within you which doesn't want to settle for justice, joyful life

a4614873-44e5-4588-b642-00767d6d16bc-2
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:45.720
either.

3ad664e0-bd54-4ba2-910b-294b60a76069-0
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.916
You're very happy and after some time even that doesn't seem to

3ad664e0-bd54-4ba2-910b-294b60a76069-1
00:08:52.916 --> 00:08:57.320
be enough because happiness is missing right now.

4e83ce7a-d266-4513-8cee-80e3856bbc99-0
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.400
The whole life seems to be pursuit of happiness.

db796438-3858-43d4-ab7a-12188a0d6595-0
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.640
If you're joyful then you will see it's not enough.

549411aa-3cee-49ff-8cf2-e08b9378f83e-0
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.969
In fact, if you're very happy, you will do many more things

549411aa-3cee-49ff-8cf2-e08b9378f83e-1
00:09:09.969 --> 00:09:11.640
than when you're unhappy.

0f55fd49-4a27-48a0-af85-f6576e04c4de-0
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:13.880
Isn't it so?

6808b051-285b-4525-b41f-b145d6c3e2f9-0
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.451
Because now you're charged and now there's nothing pulling you

6808b051-285b-4525-b41f-b145d6c3e2f9-1
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:21.840
back.

4de46eba-3564-444b-8227-dee570f304cb-0
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.880
You have all the enthusiasm to go about and do lots of things.

9f99ab39-fd7d-47d9-a80c-fcb749d38ee9-0
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.880
So there is something that this life is longing for.

03d17444-bd78-42f9-a38f-79e2c71a7ca7-0
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.360
It's not a desire, it's its destination.

5a9f979a-b849-4431-81e2-f156ff620fea-0
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.800
It is not something, a desire that you created or I created.

e2ca797f-d64b-4335-97c4-c9b22655adc3-0
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.800
It is just longing to go towards a certain destination.

a0ddd8e8-5d22-4f74-8651-45cfe97e407e-0
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.651
The only choice that we have is either to move towards this

a0ddd8e8-5d22-4f74-8651-45cfe97e407e-1
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.040
destination consciously or unconsciously.

c624325a-449e-4458-bb12-e5509b5b7429-0
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.603
Any way we are moving, whether to go towards it consciously or

c624325a-449e-4458-bb12-e5509b5b7429-1
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:03.600
unconsciously.

ac1cb636-9c42-4333-be1e-9612726a0702-0
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.094
If we are dragged towards something unconsciously, even if

ac1cb636-9c42-4333-be1e-9612726a0702-1
00:10:08.094 --> 00:10:11.525
we are dragged towards heaven, we will suffer the dragging,

ac1cb636-9c42-4333-be1e-9612726a0702-2
00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:12.040
isn't it?

d9b953b8-8452-466d-9555-74ec506913de-0
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.600
Yes.

e2c5c44d-4959-4df3-a6e3-a28aac055fab-0
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.400
Now we grab you and we'll drag you out.

69e3df97-aa05-4013-9530-caf2c18ca930-0
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.800
You don't know where you're being dragged.

97e17746-b212-4002-9470-b7e4357e6606-0
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.880
You will suffer this.

4e050f39-3475-481f-99db-38de9426e719-0
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.040
We will take you and put you on a beautiful beach, sadhguru.

cf6afeb9-c426-4436-918b-c1996da13d74-0
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.720
That's later.

040d56b0-858c-42f8-b4bd-57ac6b6d8c9a-0
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.355
But right now, all along from here to there, you are going to

040d56b0-858c-42f8-b4bd-57ac6b6d8c9a-1
00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:35.000
suffer it terribly, isn't it?

0eb3f1d4-02e5-4a58-afdb-578f46878a19-0
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.360
So if you walk towards anything, or if life drags you towards a

0eb3f1d4-02e5-4a58-afdb-578f46878a19-1
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.830
certain direction and you are unconscious about it, you will

0eb3f1d4-02e5-4a58-afdb-578f46878a19-2
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.480
suffer the process immensely.

bdf248e2-0a71-4bbb-a2ea-2d6372c74bf0-0
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.700
So if you look at it consciously, if you go towards

bdf248e2-0a71-4bbb-a2ea-2d6372c74bf0-1
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.880
it consciously, then the process becomes beautiful.

7bf72fdb-4db9-457d-8583-e265ebf3c751-0
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.640
That's all the choice we have, really.

ef48d1e1-3e1b-4eea-93a6-c8e2e951dc4b-0
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.720
We once we are conscious, we naturally haste in the process.

4a723a60-45d9-4336-8aac-b7672e61069e-0
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.080
Whatever we are unconscious of and that level we suffer.

453c9cbe-585f-44b4-98a3-ce8ff65c13ba-0
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.360
You must understand this.

8b8a84a9-35dc-4f11-9f7c-b3b2f708e1e2-0
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.880
See, right now you're driving on the street.

cd638bba-7f84-4aa1-a675-f7723b533ada-0
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.130
You are completely unconscious of who is coming behind you, who

cd638bba-7f84-4aa1-a675-f7723b533ada-1
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.240
is coming in front of you.

00e57222-94b4-4189-b288-c2ee93e62d8d-0
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.541
Now you are going to get into one kind of physical suffering

00e57222-94b4-4189-b288-c2ee93e62d8d-1
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:20.840
because you are unaware of the physical reality.

3f75de24-b2a7-4868-badd-9cc992954c12-0
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.000
Physical suffering will come.

315ec57c-142d-4d17-9387-e9018ce9b5db-0
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.640
Something is going to break, isn't it?

de741335-6bd6-4a71-8c79-9413500ca064-0
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.240
Now you're unaware of what is happening in your body.

ed6c5696-1bbe-40f2-8972-06908a03995e-0
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.640
Another kind of suffering will come.

de3b5b90-ed75-48f4-ad63-a170379318b3-0
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.240
You're unaware of what's happening in your mind.

1d20b7e7-95e3-4aa2-bf7f-227895e46f96-0
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.920
Another kind of suffering will come.

dcb509cd-0493-42f1-a7f0-ae28a155ec8f-0
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.280
You're unaware of what's happening in your family.

53e071fc-c4e9-4151-b045-5df5850d36b1-0
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.800
Another kind of suffering will come.

17767514-8ad0-41cc-aafa-453214f2ceb8-0
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.073
Similarly, wherever you're unaware, that level of suffering

17767514-8ad0-41cc-aafa-453214f2ceb8-1
00:11:48.073 --> 00:11:49.080
will come to you.

a27c9eb4-5ac7-433e-a30b-892dfa012e05-0
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.720
Is that so?

61a45cfc-49c6-4553-b7af-3dbe492a51a6-0
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.920
You're getting this is holiday, you're getting dead serious.

48f98634-58e2-4db1-ac80-f46559082a3b-0
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.400
Once a pirate.

07a624db-98ad-48c0-908d-43e325d02f15-0
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.080
No pirate.

c3d1e0ff-54ca-4dfd-9bc4-18699a05eecc-0
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.040
A pirate walked into the bar.

f822a43c-2e37-47d1-abd5-1505cb77a1a6-0
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.900
The bartender knew him from long ago, He's seen him just the

f822a43c-2e37-47d1-abd5-1505cb77a1a6-1
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.720
previous year, and now he's come back after his expeditions.

f18b1fe8-3d01-4791-9587-ef4ee07c2f60-0
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.360
He looked at him and said, Hey, what happened to you?

1a65abe7-fb9f-4d3f-8ae1-59b069588fc1-0
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.360
You look terrible, the poet said.

5fad3d65-8ef3-4e77-b0c0-e4fc48e38894-0
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.520
No, I'm just feeling just about fine.

a7c0a258-e1d7-4866-8520-0d4622f69610-0
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.360
Then, the bartender said.

4d1c2f24-b198-451e-9b2e-a5ccd2b60ed7-0
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.560
But what happened to your leg?

ffa9d0cf-a452-4394-afb3-5fe0da530a99-0
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.200
Why the wooden leg?

d9752f5a-b08a-4361-a823-69e8e87bee28-0
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.400
Oh that?

1c1daeea-df3c-47c9-ace7-a398026ca1e3-0
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.920
We were just having a battle with another rival group.

f775834e-a767-4b5e-aa08-550b2b361431-0
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.874
I saw a cannonball coming straight at me before I could

f775834e-a767-4b5e-aa08-550b2b361431-1
00:12:51.874 --> 00:12:52.160
move.

f2da4abb-8c60-470b-89c5-30e6a019ea40-0
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.379
It hit my right leg and I'm doing quite fine with the wooden

f2da4abb-8c60-470b-89c5-30e6a019ea40-1
00:12:57.379 --> 00:12:59.080
leg, I'm pretty good.

1bfa0685-bf8e-43ef-81d9-4259a3ecf644-0
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.120
And the bartender said, what about the hook?

eddf508b-a37f-4198-95a7-67dedb5239a8-0
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.880
He said, left hand, you have a hook.

cf48cb95-d84e-4bb8-bc76-e56b3c06b6a0-0
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.280
What happened to that?

d07d44a5-4710-49dd-9906-c521674cc91a-0
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.970
Oh, we were just having a sword fight for fun and my left hand

d07d44a5-4710-49dd-9906-c521674cc91a-1
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.040
got chopped off.

3e0f3fd4-1109-4666-a82b-fdbb18622a5b-0
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.200
But I'm doing quite fine with this hook.

47610117-489a-4ecb-9869-8dda58ec80fa-0
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.480
In fact, it's more useful than the hand.

5d056861-13b0-487b-bd95-9cfbf57309ba-0
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.720
Then he asked, what about the eye patch?

2f559d43-7fe3-4879-afdb-ac6032ada133-0
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.600
You lost one eye.

13531a5e-8cd5-4bb8-98a9-085afe0d8bf8-0
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.280
What happened?

85939b8b-309e-463d-9122-ce238d63ac38-0
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.760
Oh, that?

aabdfcd3-fd64-48f8-89db-892e8811badb-0
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:37.077
I was just looking up at the sky, and a bird poop fell into

aabdfcd3-fd64-48f8-89db-892e8811badb-1
00:13:37.077 --> 00:13:37.920
my eyes.

bb919f1c-a95e-4b8b-8bac-1c0bc2b03dc0-0
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.760
Oh, come on.

fa93f121-f738-43d7-a6a2-c1ed82ea163d-0
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.760
Whoever heard of anybody losing their eyes for bird poop?

066b9394-8af6-4f3a-8c44-50babb0c3240-0
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.800
How would you lose your eyes for bird poop?

5a41a741-1ab5-4b0b-b56d-7616ff235276-0
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.160
No, that was the first day I had my hook on.

15b8436d-a045-462d-bbe2-2df198abf840-0
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.360
Whatever you are not aware of there, you suffer.

13317aad-cf12-4694-a2f0-de350848d444-0
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.040
Isn't this there that brings suffering to you?

03d3bad1-c947-40d5-b8e1-43a14302e3ab-0
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.760
So we're talking about awareness, Awareness.

9042075b-4ee3-4802-ac3e-197d72799dbb-0
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.640
Awareness.

861596ad-bd23-415c-b851-aafa0fbb61ad-0
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.120
Awareness is not something that you do, actually.

b40b46eb-f444-432e-8775-28dc6f9c5a58-0
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.723
In fact, the less you do, the more aware you become within

b40b46eb-f444-432e-8775-28dc6f9c5a58-1
00:14:25.723 --> 00:14:31.455
yourself, the less your activity becomes inside what you call as

b40b46eb-f444-432e-8775-28dc6f9c5a58-2
00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:31.720
me.

41fbc287-819f-4e97-8ce1-7b3e87d1d843-0
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.161
The less that becomes, the more your awareness becomes, The less

41fbc287-819f-4e97-8ce1-7b3e87d1d843-1
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:39.840
your personality becomes, the more your presence becomes.

94640e83-abf4-4b4c-8b89-0f344cda22e2-0
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.800
Always.

ba8886c4-b8ab-4175-9b26-6d6c18b7c8d6-0
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.040
Personality means you have to do a lot to keep it up, isn't it?

eca1a5f0-2475-4148-a06e-b58148bb2cdd-0
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.973
Yes, most of the activity that you're doing to keep up your

eca1a5f0-2475-4148-a06e-b58148bb2cdd-1
00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:54.659
person is unconscious, but you're doing enormous activity

eca1a5f0-2475-4148-a06e-b58148bb2cdd-2
00:14:54.659 --> 00:14:57.520
to maintain a certain personality, isn't it?

316e79f2-5f7d-4a5d-b0cc-384542e33b67-0
00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.820
If that activity gets lowered, suddenly awareness gets

316e79f2-5f7d-4a5d-b0cc-384542e33b67-1
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.680
heightened.

9cb50a31-9a35-4094-b6d8-a0e290bce1d6-0
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.280
Because awareness is not something that you do.

a0a31730-e158-42ff-8693-474d9f308f83-0
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.480
The very life is awareness, isn't it?

4632ec42-945d-41ec-a1a0-e3e7aecf778a-0
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.240
The very basis of life is awareness.

c86a98e7-4cee-47f7-87b3-e4f30844d6cb-0
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.040
You know that you're alive only because you're aware, isn't it?

476ec8fa-bebf-41f8-a9a3-c7e5ab3a9b08-0
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.876
If all awareness disappears, at least on this level, we can call

476ec8fa-bebf-41f8-a9a3-c7e5ab3a9b08-1
00:15:19.876 --> 00:15:20.480
it death.

4290dbbc-eff1-42c2-b0ba-6ff5540888c6-0
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.000
So spirituality is not something that you do.

b98f6105-7dd5-4c38-b880-f8ee1d27efb9-0
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.501
If you stop doing all your nonsense, you're spiritual, you

b98f6105-7dd5-4c38-b880-f8ee1d27efb9-1
00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:34.880
know.

6505cc44-f82e-423c-992b-387627f42a5b-0
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.560
Unnecessary nonsense.

e855c950-1c4f-456b-bcaf-ca7bd9da7df0-0
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.677
If you stop spirituality is, you know, not something that you

e855c950-1c4f-456b-bcaf-ca7bd9da7df0-1
00:15:41.677 --> 00:15:44.600
have to do and make it happen or create it.

be1ba787-6ff2-42c8-925a-494f9fdeaa3a-0
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.720
It's not so.

1429025c-372e-412d-8a8d-e20e74d121c6-0
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.320
But still.

061776f8-2f3c-44ab-8286-1164f1be9df5-0
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.080
Why?

7eb395cf-cf4e-40b4-80d5-35791b0ad445-0
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.320
If that is so, why am I doing my pranayam in the morning?

6bc5f975-c92b-43de-812b-10b6fef5e700-0
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.880
Oh, even in a resort.

cac2470d-8a3b-43e4-9c91-e6f037ea37c5-0
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.000
They made us do it.

26df340d-b964-479a-b297-34572d10ed66-0
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.040
I'm sorry, the resort.

3c3a80b9-c69c-4cfc-ba8c-6d10362ca442-0
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.920
That's because there is no brakes on your activity.

722b6333-e58a-4474-90df-db2ab6e4cde3-0
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.400
What you do within yourself, you have no brakes on it.

c3f66f40-54d3-4f87-b4a6-30d210a1df35-0
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.904
So we are creating a certain physical, mental and energy

c3f66f40-54d3-4f87-b4a6-30d210a1df35-1
00:16:29.904 --> 00:16:37.080
situation where everything gets diverted from your activity.

2e8ab8aa-470a-42d3-b4e3-bf1340f5cefc-0
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.454
Slowly practice establishes a situation where the life

2e8ab8aa-470a-42d3-b4e3-bf1340f5cefc-1
00:16:43.454 --> 00:16:49.105
energies raised to a certain pitch and intensity that slowly

2e8ab8aa-470a-42d3-b4e3-bf1340f5cefc-2
00:16:49.105 --> 00:16:52.439
the activity becomes insignificant.

3a2f4807-c439-4d94-af5c-05de572e49c2-0
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.560
It's still there, it's still happening.

bc14950f-3604-4f4a-86ef-f88a9ea9ba33-0
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.160
You've seen this in Shonya meditation.

d3c39890-9f89-42f1-baa5-0480eb663211-0
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.157
You've just said activity is still happening, but it's

d3c39890-9f89-42f1-baa5-0480eb663211-1
00:17:00.157 --> 00:17:00.920
insignificant.

ff7a58c5-08d6-4d31-a07d-7d64af2a81b6-0
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.137
The same activity which was so significant has become

ff7a58c5-08d6-4d31-a07d-7d64af2a81b6-1
00:17:04.137 --> 00:17:04.920
insignificant.

6b285785-92e4-4f5f-9b20-ba8cb505613e-0
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.200
We have not stopped it.

0c51d3ae-7d60-4cfa-be5e-17dff0b01ef9-0
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.726
We have not done anything to, but somehow it has become not so

0c51d3ae-7d60-4cfa-be5e-17dff0b01ef9-1
00:17:12.726 --> 00:17:13.680
important.

036b76cf-c6cd-4e73-a133-bd78be17f019-0
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.272
You see this happening when you just sit and meditate and show

036b76cf-c6cd-4e73-a133-bd78be17f019-1
00:17:18.272 --> 00:17:19.760
me everything is happening.

ed763261-be4b-473b-83ce-76cbd0d3903c-0
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.320
But it's no more important.

6b06e8d7-dff6-4fcf-97a2-a4c30cf4e6fb-0
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.040
It's lost its significance, it's lost its impact upon you.

5ae2a35b-7ca4-4efc-8fb2-e41b0b41f99e-0
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.680
It's lost its influence upon you.

8e08effc-6cb3-4fb9-aec2-4378dc871084-0
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.520
It doesn't mould you anymore.

6b1df962-304f-4af6-a611-e5e13d63b637-0
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.480
All the activity of the mind stops moulding you.

a3dd5ec2-bdab-4ba0-bbfe-27596d80d633-0
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:42.670
You're no more being moulded by that activity, this, this whole

a3dd5ec2-bdab-4ba0-bbfe-27596d80d633-1
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:50.948
distortion that we have done to life in the form of creating our

a3dd5ec2-bdab-4ba0-bbfe-27596d80d633-2
00:17:50.948 --> 00:17:51.840
person.

79f8e263-aed8-4fe2-8538-f001f796b9bc-0
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.688
See, when you create your personality, because it's

79f8e263-aed8-4fe2-8538-f001f796b9bc-1
00:17:58.688 --> 00:18:02.358
created mostly unconsciously, just a small part of it may be

79f8e263-aed8-4fe2-8538-f001f796b9bc-2
00:18:02.358 --> 00:18:02.960
conscious.

3725c7ee-8eba-47ec-8e4b-dc624fa8aeb3-0
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.760
Rest of it is all unconscious, isn't it Sadhguru?

3c577f16-94ff-4c72-a5ed-cf4701a2fa12-0
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.427
When you create your own your personality somewhere in one

3c577f16-94ff-4c72-a5ed-cf4701a2fa12-1
00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:19.094
way, it means somewhere you thought creator has not done a

3c577f16-94ff-4c72-a5ed-cf4701a2fa12-2
00:18:19.094 --> 00:18:22.360
good enough job on you, isn't it?

c28208ab-a199-43f7-a2e6-2f01f717b14b-0
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.142
If it needs improvement, definitely he did not do a good

c28208ab-a199-43f7-a2e6-2f01f717b14b-1
00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:32.200
enough job on you, isn't it so?

f085994a-1ae4-44d4-913e-ea31272e8b13-0
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.967
So why would you feel that such a grand creation is not good

f085994a-1ae4-44d4-913e-ea31272e8b13-1
00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:36.400
enough?

73157905-ae44-4651-86b4-1bb53637f681-0
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.800
Something that's so enormous and fantastic is not good enough.

e3bcaa06-c018-4742-94a2-ef84054d745b-0
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.320
Why?

dadeecdf-e714-47cf-b351-45f7a46390f6-0
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.937
Because in this simple process of self preservation, you know,

dadeecdf-e714-47cf-b351-45f7a46390f6-1
00:18:53.937 --> 00:18:59.634
there is a simple basic process which is built into every cell

dadeecdf-e714-47cf-b351-45f7a46390f6-2
00:18:59.634 --> 00:19:00.720
in our body.

f443d2a7-afca-4905-9f47-75c0fe3f1f14-0
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.320
Every worm, insect, animal has this.

f2852957-da37-44a0-8e70-742b6638be46-0
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.920
We also have it, Sadhguru.

16fee808-f0ad-4bc7-8435-28e29c07442f-0
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.920
Simple process of self preservation.

8547800f-b155-47df-9bc5-d3e77b33c736-0
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.440
We don't know where to contain it.

f28c689f-c7d0-493b-8432-a0db11e623f0-0
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.200
It has just spread itself into everything.

aecbce2b-681e-49d5-b1e1-17129dad1815-0
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.000
Because it's spread itself into everything.

76b4c2b6-e2c0-47b4-9172-33a72ae8c3bf-0
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.487
You have to create a small person of yourself who will

76b4c2b6-e2c0-47b4-9172-33a72ae8c3bf-1
00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:22.120
defend himself all the time.

1a7fae72-f495-4cff-84e9-4524347a0225-0
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.666
As we've been looking at in the programs, the only thing that

1a7fae72-f495-4cff-84e9-4524347a0225-1
00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:31.640
needs preservation is your physical body, your personality.

f07b6280-8c05-480c-a51e-f8671d902f43-0
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.920
We must maul it every day.

f4b1591b-ced8-4890-bc76-a48b7797b8b9-0
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.240
It should be OK, isn't it?

780d0636-6410-4f36-924f-39e721f8fc22-0
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.400
Every day?

be273ad3-cf2d-4289-9838-58bd81548eff-0
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.369
If we can make mincemeat out of your personality, you could

be273ad3-cf2d-4289-9838-58bd81548eff-1
00:19:38.369 --> 00:19:40.200
create another one tomorrow morning.

fe42d787-94a9-49fc-8d10-04bd9729e913-0
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.680
Isn't it?

5ec123a1-6bc6-4afd-bfb6-2d8ba0577497-0
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.200
Isn't it?

727f1010-cf71-4eb2-9a92-68ea77eb6804-0
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.233
So we've been trying to do that gently, because if I go very

727f1010-cf71-4eb2-9a92-68ea77eb6804-1
00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:53.360
hard at it, you'll run away gently, step by step.

fb73347a-fa65-460e-a7ea-5839155053c3-0
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.413
We're trying to make mincemeat out of your personality so that

fb73347a-fa65-460e-a7ea-5839155053c3-1
00:19:57.413 --> 00:19:59.280
it becomes a flexible aspect.

df033380-bf9a-4891-a87c-730de964d1fe-0
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.240
You cannot live without a personality.

d3a6c3d0-793b-4c55-8d48-fbfcbd640f4a-0
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.960
You need one to exist here to.

88b683cb-634b-4bac-9312-2620d462ec86-0
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.600
Go about in the world, do all your work, manage things.

a0a762a2-c810-4aac-bb37-7c900d242b51-0
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.431
But if it's a flexible thing that in different places, as it

a0a762a2-c810-4aac-bb37-7c900d242b51-1
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:16.660
is necessary for the situation you can put on the right kind of

a0a762a2-c810-4aac-bb37-7c900d242b51-2
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.039
personality, then it would be fine.

157c8edc-2e79-4636-9cfa-853d4aa6c249-0
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.800
But right now it is like a rock.

a60dd4c0-b977-47d7-bdcf-c64b219b67bb-0
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.560
It sits on you all the time.

f97f3692-d8a5-445f-8f9d-b937d384c036-0
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.960
Anything that doesn't fit into its ambit.

7c6ccc3a-e331-432c-97b4-cd4f60d44286-0
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.600
It makes you suffer, isn't it?

9f926aa9-014e-4e12-8e09-9bf4f6060b3a-0
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:39.760
Who drew this caricature that you call as myself?

9a6e6144-d7d1-4af4-a983-9460c09a8955-0
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.172
Definitely yourself, but influenced by so many people

9a6e6144-d7d1-4af4-a983-9460c09a8955-1
00:20:46.172 --> 00:20:47.080
around you?

5d6c3846-a585-4b08-9470-0cf39a8333c6-0
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.280
You know you're 1516.

9b0ff2a3-4466-49fa-8c4a-3bd69cbdee95-0
00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.560
You go and watch a Amitabh
Bachchan movie.

58ab1ae7-1614-4452-88df-fd2c4cf8ae10-0
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.440
You come home and try to walk like him.

857c4585-11f5-4ce2-891d-27c8c445c879-0
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:01.160
Unconsciously, yes, isn't it?

dfacddc5-7bcd-4e7f-91e6-d3471ce0d9e1-0
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.080
Sometimes.

b7496718-a873-4a62-9641-94a1d005735f-0
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.083
Maybe consciously, but most of the time unconsciously, isn't

b7496718-a873-4a62-9641-94a1d005735f-1
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:06.280
it?

bf675d86-161c-492a-adcf-854348532451-0
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.592
So this caricature came into existence because of all kinds

bf675d86-161c-492a-adcf-854348532451-1
00:21:13.592 --> 00:21:17.160
of bits and pieces that are gathered.

61d7f330-4eff-4e2e-83a6-7c202db645f3-0
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.880
It happened when we were in school.

5323b8a5-d764-40bc-bc8a-d54ca99ec7ae-0
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.651
There was a boy who was studying with me, who had a excellent

5323b8a5-d764-40bc-bc8a-d54ca99ec7ae-1
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:35.120
hand.

59ecbeec-c357-4c7a-97ba-8b45c7f1c2e0-0
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.386
You know, he could just sketch anybody with whatever kind of

59ecbeec-c357-4c7a-97ba-8b45c7f1c2e0-1
00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:42.200
distortion he wanted.

9acc40e3-8d4b-412a-8b49-a7c9c4dca395-0
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:54.769
So there was one very hated geography teacher, and when he

9acc40e3-8d4b-412a-8b49-a7c9c4dca395-1
00:21:54.769 --> 00:22:03.175
entered the class, this boy had a horrible caricature of him

9acc40e3-8d4b-412a-8b49-a7c9c4dca395-2
00:22:03.175 --> 00:22:11.443
ready on the blackboard, badly distorted, but everybody can

9acc40e3-8d4b-412a-8b49-a7c9c4dca395-3
00:22:11.443 --> 00:22:19.021
clearly recognize who it is with all kinds of very bad

9acc40e3-8d4b-412a-8b49-a7c9c4dca395-4
00:22:19.021 --> 00:22:21.640
distortions on him.

80514817-d3c1-44b3-977f-151ebca0b5d9-0
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.512
Then he walked in and as usual, he walks into the class always

80514817-d3c1-44b3-977f-151ebca0b5d9-1
00:22:28.512 --> 00:22:29.560
with a temper.

5909b32e-544e-41e6-bed3-a955397de6b1-0
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.919
Whether he's talking about the grasslands in America or he

5909b32e-544e-41e6-bed3-a955397de6b1-1
00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:38.177
talks about the deserts in
Africa, he's always in bad

5909b32e-544e-41e6-bed3-a955397de6b1-2
00:22:38.177 --> 00:22:38.600
temper.

e1994cc3-d1db-406a-a072-c669cd62776b-0
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:51.120
He the moment he saw he just one thing he was angry.

6561e546-e267-4430-b964-46557c00f0ee-0
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.481
Another thing, he was somehow hit by the whole thing, the

6561e546-e267-4430-b964-46557c00f0ee-1
00:22:54.481 --> 00:22:55.160
distortions.

e72156d0-2bee-445d-90e0-25e69d0e610b-0
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.160
Then he asked who is responsible for this terrible atrocity?

d623f8eb-2aef-4269-a4bf-459358acba56-0
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.673
As usual, you know, everybody suddenly interested in

d623f8eb-2aef-4269-a4bf-459358acba56-1
00:23:08.673 --> 00:23:09.200
geography.

e9f86e19-40d6-486a-9588-6ee67ec4fabb-0
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.000
Very studious.

f0f3d779-16dd-4e2c-8beb-dc9d674b784d-0
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:20.440
And then he repeated the game.

e620e2f8-b1d2-41d5-bb04-427b4ad22732-0
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.880
Who is responsible for this atrocity?

93776a99-7cec-4f4a-982e-453d6887159d-0
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.240
He thinks it's an atrocity.

334b9e7f-9536-438c-8483-1ba09dd18ae0-0
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.560
We thought it was appropriate.

bedbc53d-2fd5-4243-9b9f-9f5487c9b89d-0
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:41.201
Then somebody made-up their mind and stood up and said we really

bedbc53d-2fd5-4243-9b9f-9f5487c9b89d-1
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:46.320
don't know, but it should be his parents.

efbc8051-5e6d-423d-8e79-922753eee6fd-0
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.005
So for this atrocity that you call as myself, it's not your

efbc8051-5e6d-423d-8e79-922753eee6fd-1
00:24:10.005 --> 00:24:12.080
parents, this is you.

5808498f-d64c-4458-a68c-c46839766fe1-0
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.187
Only you can commit this atrocity of distorting yourself

5808498f-d64c-4458-a68c-c46839766fe1-1
00:24:18.187 --> 00:24:20.440
into such a tiny possibility.

8d9d17f6-f1f4-498d-b5cc-dc301f47df0e-0
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.929
When an unbounded possibility was what you were offered with

8d9d17f6-f1f4-498d-b5cc-dc301f47df0e-1
00:24:25.929 --> 00:24:29.760
life, you were offered an unbounded possibility.

dbebe021-0ba9-47f4-8de9-8169771713a2-0
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.214
You made a such a bad distortion and made yourself into such a

dbebe021-0ba9-47f4-8de9-8169771713a2-1
00:24:35.214 --> 00:24:39.207
tiny possibility if you stop creating this caricature,

dbebe021-0ba9-47f4-8de9-8169771713a2-2
00:24:39.207 --> 00:24:43.419
because this caricature cannot exist one day without your

dbebe021-0ba9-47f4-8de9-8169771713a2-3
00:24:43.419 --> 00:24:44.000
support.

5e772675-17d0-4431-b78e-8fe996324eb7-0
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.880
You need to support it all the time, Sadhguru.

40ed9dcb-ade4-423b-aadd-99a85e20c19a-0
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.817
What meditation means, means in one way you're just withdrawing

40ed9dcb-ade4-423b-aadd-99a85e20c19a-1
00:24:52.817 --> 00:24:55.440
the support for your personality.

416ff0b0-e409-4e29-b746-ced1f36d823a-0
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.600
That's how suddenly it collapses.

4c1f6dd7-b756-41e3-a6a8-f61d9821373c-0
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.560
Only the presence is there, the person is no more there.

59c587e4-e0d4-46a2-8712-28755e848bb0-0
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.590
If you could walk on the street like this, if you could operate

59c587e4-e0d4-46a2-8712-28755e848bb0-1
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.960
with people like this all the time, that you have no

59c587e4-e0d4-46a2-8712-28755e848bb0-2
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.966
personality but looking at this person at this moment, how she

59c587e4-e0d4-46a2-8712-28755e848bb0-3
00:25:16.966 --> 00:25:20.782
is, accordingly you put up a personality as it is necessary

59c587e4-e0d4-46a2-8712-28755e848bb0-4
00:25:20.782 --> 00:25:21.800
for this person.

12f527f1-0258-4930-b8c8-86cdf88bbe56-0
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.034
Now you go to that person, you put up a personality that is

12f527f1-0258-4930-b8c8-86cdf88bbe56-1
00:25:25.034 --> 00:25:26.280
necessary for that person.

7190e9fd-d62a-4fd7-8adc-324734efd1de-0
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.465
Then it would be so much fun drawing new new caricatures

7190e9fd-d62a-4fd7-8adc-324734efd1de-1
00:25:30.465 --> 00:25:31.080
every day.

f0d28265-0401-4a1e-83e3-4dea474d7178-0
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.600
But once you get stuck to a particular distortion, that

f0d28265-0401-4a1e-83e3-4dea474d7178-1
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.600
becomes a problem every day.

48f6b1e2-6def-45c0-9ea2-292be77834db-0
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.720
If you have a new distortion, it's called art, isn't it?

378127c3-6de9-4f68-9697-98b35335cfae-0
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.441
If you're stuck with one distortion, then it's called

378127c3-6de9-4f68-9697-98b35335cfae-1
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:50.600
You're called a freak, isn't it?

7cf2ce59-5082-499e-91c4-24ae16d69389-0
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.200
Isn't it?

8136c2b5-c7c9-48a0-a5c3-731fab24f80a-0
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.272
So every day, if you're able to create a new distortion, that is

8136c2b5-c7c9-48a0-a5c3-731fab24f80a-1
00:25:56.272 --> 00:25:57.400
artwork, isn't it?

17cb2d05-67af-49b6-abb2-e6b601e6e2de-0
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.200
If you're stuck with one distortion, you're a cripple.

5f2b6255-ba62-402a-84b4-b3cd3b8ca4b1-0
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.553
So that's the big difference
Sadhguru, when you're talking

5f2b6255-ba62-402a-84b4-b3cd3b8ca4b1-1
00:26:09.553 --> 00:26:14.506
about personality, Sadhguru, we have to have different

5f2b6255-ba62-402a-84b4-b3cd3b8ca4b1-2
00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:19.280
personalities as a parent, as a husband and at work.

124b9c3a-0cd5-423d-b5eb-a4fa3c0c85b5-0
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.560
In normal living.

c1f21bae-a75b-4ce8-a1e6-aa4651adf8c0-0
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.080
It becomes very difficult to change the personality.

88c6cdea-bd81-4ca7-a72f-eb29aaa6a8c9-0
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.281
Sadhguru, you mean to say people around you won't let you change

88c6cdea-bd81-4ca7-a72f-eb29aaa6a8c9-1
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:28.400
it?

92f1f26e-74ae-4e45-b957-e3942071d81c-0
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.400
Not true.

aeea3c9a-cb4d-4b8d-8da7-0446d17b434e-0
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.160
See, right now let's say you are going to work in us.

6927b739-49f3-43b5-94ab-cd406c876ec7-0
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.275
We'll take the work situation because it's less personal for

6927b739-49f3-43b5-94ab-cd406c876ec7-1
00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:37.440
you.

4b312395-b117-431a-812f-f298479117ff-0
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.386
You are going to work with a certain attitude, and a certain

4b312395-b117-431a-812f-f298479117ff-1
00:26:43.386 --> 00:26:46.920
certain person is going to work, which is you right?

b4d1d141-62a5-4d82-926f-86071f33d038-0
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:53.000
Now, let's say he goes briskly like this every day.

5f442eff-164a-40fe-aada-896f96b473a1-0
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.240
Hmm.

f20840e1-df2b-422c-8f31-ba7d0078157e-0
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.000
Good morning.

e6ea3fcd-3d65-4add-abea-88cd7913b1b5-0
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.360
Good morning.

c9f891c8-ad32-4df8-a6a6-719d96338322-0
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.720
Good morning.

0fd9827e-bf35-4689-a393-70911ef7f129-0
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.120
Don't mean a good morning to anybody.

277a100b-74e4-4dc4-a347-61fdd31b2cb5-0
00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.127
The way people say good morning, it's very clear they intend to

277a100b-74e4-4dc4-a347-61fdd31b2cb5-1
00:27:03.127 --> 00:27:04.280
give you a bad morning.

ff783da3-3467-426a-bd06-b89178ae1da6-0
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.280
So suppose you are going like this tomorrow morning.

4625c031-349f-465a-bf1e-52386a969076-0
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.168
If you go really say good morning to people and smile at

4625c031-349f-465a-bf1e-52386a969076-1
00:27:18.168 --> 00:27:21.802
them and maybe hold their hand and ask some personal question,

4625c031-349f-465a-bf1e-52386a969076-2
00:27:21.802 --> 00:27:25.379
talk to them and go in, maybe you'll waste 5-10 minutes going

4625c031-349f-465a-bf1e-52386a969076-3
00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:26.360
into your office.

dcfe5d6a-69e9-4155-8d51-692e2ac6e390-0
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.421
But if people around you are happy, you'll have lot of extra

dcfe5d6a-69e9-4155-8d51-692e2ac6e390-1
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:33.590
time on your hands because they'll run around and do things

dcfe5d6a-69e9-4155-8d51-692e2ac6e390-2
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.960
better.

c6030ca0-dcb2-4557-accf-81852174995f-0
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:35.760
Isn't it?

ac93b886-d9ce-44d3-b9b4-0e7613c9ceac-0
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.499
If you have people who are sitting there with the grouse,

ac93b886-d9ce-44d3-b9b4-0e7613c9ceac-1
00:27:40.499 --> 00:27:44.284
then you know they will make your life miserable in so many

ac93b886-d9ce-44d3-b9b4-0e7613c9ceac-2
00:27:44.284 --> 00:27:44.600
ways.

82958a90-5546-4ff2-82dc-c0f68f92b037-0
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.922
Not one way you have to live with them, but these people have

82958a90-5546-4ff2-82dc-c0f68f92b037-1
00:27:48.922 --> 00:27:50.200
the grouse against you.

363018f1-0369-41f3-9370-05e942026b33-0
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.880
They are going to make your life so bad.

79dbe648-ff81-4be6-a0ae-d0b59e1f5654-0
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.320
Isn't it?

f94a4595-6737-4585-a6a7-c5d6ab880b78-0
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.600
Now can I change my personality every day?

65e386da-c19b-4a32-a9bd-4db0d374d32d-0
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.960
Won't it confuse people?

9171fe3d-46ab-4bff-91f6-595a2377e373-0
00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.720
Not at all.

c0574762-c153-4fb7-b64c-a4ae4ae2f42c-0
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.160
They would enjoy you most.

1c647172-44fa-45a5-b8b5-f6192a42e54e-0
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.200
Isn't it so?

573b729a-277b-44b9-be76-24e7a0ff689d-0
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.160
And will it bring down your efficiency of work?

432cbcbb-c2fd-4891-abac-12006dd43053-0
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.480
Definitely not.

a92cabc8-3bd7-4296-9de8-cfec4894345f-0
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.680
It is not because of the compulsion of the situation.

1f7df98c-9920-4e00-8089-d2b39efe90a3-0
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.520
You've gotten stuck with one personality.

263b7929-473b-4cd1-9e8d-ea090531755f-0
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.424
It is just that the whole construction of the personality

263b7929-473b-4cd1-9e8d-ea090531755f-1
00:28:19.424 --> 00:28:21.000
has happened in unawareness.

9cedbc54-599f-4139-9a03-684248265b5c-0
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.920
That's why you're stuck with one personality now.

ee5e6983-7d0f-40ef-878e-091e9ee24520-0
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.940
You said we have one kind of personality at home, another

ee5e6983-7d0f-40ef-878e-091e9ee24520-1
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.960
with children, another with, you know, work, and outside.

8a137dc7-b918-4b35-bcb4-892a6405015e-0
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.240
If you look at it, it may not be true.

77da8254-84fb-4b08-93dd-b1f78892be0c-0
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.160
You may be functioning in different capacities.

bbc9afad-584b-4a07-b4a2-12b7c5ae35a6-0
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.272
The requirement of how you function may be different, but

bbc9afad-584b-4a07-b4a2-12b7c5ae35a6-1
00:28:41.272 --> 00:28:43.920
still the basic personality may be same everywhere.

dde5e2e3-8a14-4d7e-aa77-dc2bc512a443-0
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.960
The underlying personality is still the same.

1305504b-083e-40df-9a21-9ea79b7746b5-0
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.034
You can change that also, and it'll be so much fun for you to

1305504b-083e-40df-9a21-9ea79b7746b5-1
00:28:51.034 --> 00:28:51.560
change that.

00452ddc-31d1-4d80-83e2-4469dd31020b-0
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.230
It'll be absolute fun for you to change that because you can

00452ddc-31d1-4d80-83e2-4469dd31020b-1
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.560
experience a whole new person all the time.

ec2f49c6-d7a8-4416-9744-c3cfee1f1da7-0
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.600
After all, it's your creation.

2b286292-3314-4308-8998-6db24603d358-0
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.880
Why should it be limited to just one way?

93280cd4-a990-4591-9390-ce4766276f8a-0
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.120
If God had fixed a personality for you, that's all there is.

2945c38c-b339-4531-9c35-ec4b9bf652e4-0
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.165
But when you have built it like you change your clothes every

2945c38c-b339-4531-9c35-ec4b9bf652e4-1
00:29:12.165 --> 00:29:13.800
day in different ways, isn't it?

e09d3502-42b1-44d4-94c1-3637634f1976-0
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.320
But most people cannot even change that, isn't it?

0f3a6cc2-6c24-446b-814b-1596598f3fb1-0
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.453
They've gotten used to certain thing and that's all it is,

0f3a6cc2-6c24-446b-814b-1596598f3fb1-1
00:29:20.453 --> 00:29:20.840
isn't it?

90bc2f1a-4760-4003-8ae5-fff29b36ea21-0
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.480
So I think we should have done something today.

34ef1dda-496c-4426-87b8-4d3127cb9ead-0
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.924
Everybody should dress in a completely different way and

34ef1dda-496c-4426-87b8-4d3127cb9ead-1
00:29:27.924 --> 00:29:30.160
come not your usual kind of clothes.

5623e9e4-e0ad-494d-8307-a821d76cf669-0
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.360
You're wearing pants all the time today.

4a87b6af-5c80-4866-8de2-0207fb270a00-0
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.560
You wear a saree and ***.

669c0ab9-0674-4da4-b67c-f91099e8e684-0
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.960
Just loosen yourself up a little bit, you know?

c1a61e4d-5faf-46d3-a238-91d49cd9401c-0
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:40.960
It's important.

f8469700-ec55-460d-afab-e27c9ed41860-0
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.967
The reason why what is the very essence of life is missing in

f8469700-ec55-460d-afab-e27c9ed41860-1
00:29:47.967 --> 00:29:52.570
people's life is because they become stiff and spiritual

f8469700-ec55-460d-afab-e27c9ed41860-2
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.640
people are stiffer than anybody else.

aea77a71-c98b-41ae-a112-854600d38475-0
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.320
Isn't it so stiff?

93ecf971-5f8a-49f0-8e85-263531ee85b0-0
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:08.950
It still doesn't answer your question.

37d8a539-a926-4649-9101-30feb2551ed4-0
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.230
Hmm.

5b1e61be-fd0c-4e33-9825-c5413c8c37dc-0
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.598
There can be changes in the behavior but your personality

5b1e61be-fd0c-4e33-9825-c5413c8c37dc-1
00:30:15.598 --> 00:30:16.550
remains the same.

fce43ec1-b4cb-405a-b5f6-63d72b1dd058-0
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:17.790
It remains the same.

28eff158-39db-4778-818d-68cc387b68fe-0
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.710
That's what I'm saying.

7e574415-ea64-4def-a880-b8216202cc93-0
00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.510
You are stuck to one personality.

ded380c2-f77c-4373-9d4d-cd4d4137f8c0-0
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.833
It's just the actions are different because the situations

ded380c2-f77c-4373-9d4d-cd4d4137f8c0-1
00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:25.470
are different.

aee62ba0-b1af-47cf-806d-20a17ef33d55-0
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.190
But the person is same, isn't it?

34643cc0-04df-4af6-b058-7692030134ad-0
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:33.941
So the person is same because what your personality is has

34643cc0-04df-4af6-b058-7692030134ad-1
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:34.880
become you.

b4c64024-408a-46e9-ba47-c2df6c66d6ef-0
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.680
You are completely identified with it.

07332ef7-c752-44e5-9920-2e5c2528c92b-0
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.160
TCH.

4ec3d675-eb24-446e-96bf-0c9b726463a7-0
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.544
There is no distinction between you and your personality, isn't

4ec3d675-eb24-446e-96bf-0c9b726463a7-1
00:30:41.544 --> 00:30:41.720
it?

77f0fcb6-ad2b-4bf7-92c4-2969fa0e8eaf-0
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.680
You have become that the mask has gotten stuck to your face.

29a9d52b-a7b7-4703-85da-c623a2c0bb96-0
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.240
Now you can't take away the mask if this mask has to come off.

7aa350d5-b23c-4f51-9b2a-b40ccdbf99bb-0
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.777
We need something to loosen the glue which has gotten stuck to

7aa350d5-b23c-4f51-9b2a-b40ccdbf99bb-1
00:30:55.777 --> 00:30:56.160
this.

2145b10a-5193-4849-8fe9-095e7296324f-0
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.320
It is identity.

75c6b5e8-6305-4ede-9bcd-2f3d69930182-0
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.066
So now we are creating various situations where your identity

75c6b5e8-6305-4ede-9bcd-2f3d69930182-1
00:31:03.066 --> 00:31:04.960
dissolves in a certain way.

e314d4db-069a-4a12-b305-555c12fab1af-0
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.118
Meditation or any kind of yoga practice, whatever, is just to

e314d4db-069a-4a12-b305-555c12fab1af-1
00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:13.538
loosen the identities so that there's a little more

e314d4db-069a-4a12-b305-555c12fab1af-2
00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:14.919
flexibility about it.

44722548-70d4-46cb-87f2-9fedb44c5d8a-0
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.492
Maybe the whole of it has not come off, but at least you can

44722548-70d4-46cb-87f2-9fedb44c5d8a-1
00:31:18.492 --> 00:31:19.840
adjust it a little bit.

dd5e0be0-c896-4c70-b96a-3406a3969097-0
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:21.920
There's a mask.

59064c2d-5583-4ecc-9353-81372d4f632b-0
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.079
Being totally stuck, at least little, you are able to take a

59064c2d-5583-4ecc-9353-81372d4f632b-1
00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:29.080
breather, that much break it is giving you.

a8b59a9b-1cef-431d-a9c8-81e4e5b5ecf3-0
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.042
But if you work a little more with this, you can take it and

a8b59a9b-1cef-431d-a9c8-81e4e5b5ecf3-1
00:31:33.042 --> 00:31:33.720
keep it off.

aed6b00c-edff-4616-bbd1-f9e75cfc479a-0
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.816
Now people, when they come to advanced programs, three days or

aed6b00c-edff-4616-bbd1-f9e75cfc479a-1
00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:43.440
seven days they're in Samyama or
Bavaspandana.

ffaf17d4-c919-45a6-820a-36d8f9a01b9d-0
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.480
The person that you are, you'll just simply forget who you are.

8a7a1be0-7a89-4e88-a45d-9f4b9d1fbc15-0
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.560
You don't know who you are.

deb2ce0c-39c8-4107-b0e8-977b77e8d782-0
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.950
It'll become like that because the situation created is so

deb2ce0c-39c8-4107-b0e8-977b77e8d782-1
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.320
intense and so different.

e89cd6c9-7eda-46dc-a4e3-8f879b70dd76-0
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.690
Everything that you know as normal is broken after some

e89cd6c9-7eda-46dc-a4e3-8f879b70dd76-1
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.120
time.

80ffe700-5a9a-4cee-a005-c14b902b6a3e-0
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.360
You don't know who is here.

af0e781f-2c15-4fe3-bd57-c583a65da831-0
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.831
After the program is over and you come back, you just wonder,

af0e781f-2c15-4fe3-bd57-c583a65da831-1
00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:08.080
is it me who went through all that?

6eb14ef1-6982-4f0e-ba5e-6e2601f4dc2c-0
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.277
Most people can't believe that they actually went through

6eb14ef1-6982-4f0e-ba5e-6e2601f4dc2c-1
00:32:15.277 --> 00:32:19.640
Samyama and came simply because it's created like that.

04ba05fb-02d9-4981-822f-6ef9cc84a705-0
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.733
The whole situation, not only the meditation process, the

04ba05fb-02d9-4981-822f-6ef9cc84a705-1
00:32:22.733 --> 00:32:25.720
situation also is created in such a way that it doesn't

04ba05fb-02d9-4981-822f-6ef9cc84a705-2
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.640
assist your personality in any way.

88e597db-2cc9-423f-9b5f-4558d1b51abe-0
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.486
The whole thing is to take off all the supports because your

88e597db-2cc9-423f-9b5f-4558d1b51abe-1
00:32:31.486 --> 00:32:34.640
personality cannot exist for a moment without your support.

2165a9d6-eb54-4c05-82d5-94839593652d-0
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.803
If you involve yourself in any intense activity, it could

2165a9d6-eb54-4c05-82d5-94839593652d-1
00:32:40.803 --> 00:32:44.080
loosen up a little bit, but that is haphazard.

c9e46348-8c92-4a4f-846c-9fe7dfe0f8f7-0
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.218
For example, let's say you go and play a game, those moments

c9e46348-8c92-4a4f-846c-9fe7dfe0f8f7-1
00:32:48.218 --> 00:32:49.560
of total involvement.

477e4e41-3b79-4243-8bfc-28e6dce702f4-0
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:54.356
You may lose your personality, but that is a haphazard way of

477e4e41-3b79-4243-8bfc-28e6dce702f4-1
00:32:54.356 --> 00:32:55.440
attempting it.

55f7aa2c-b69e-48ec-bfb2-2867395ba3dd-0
00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.020
Now we are looking at how to approach it scientifically, how

55f7aa2c-b69e-48ec-bfb2-2867395ba3dd-1
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.380
to dismantle the all the scaffolding that is holding it

55f7aa2c-b69e-48ec-bfb2-2867395ba3dd-2
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:03.560
up.

65824345-f9c8-405f-8bce-fb22fdc5acb0-0
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.440
If you have noticed this people who are very, very committed and

65824345-f9c8-405f-8bce-fb22fdc5acb0-1
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.772
enjoying the process of working sadhguru, they always have more

65824345-f9c8-405f-8bce-fb22fdc5acb0-2
00:33:14.772 --> 00:33:18.901
flexible personalities than people who are working towards a

65824345-f9c8-405f-8bce-fb22fdc5acb0-3
00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:19.240
goal.

51761585-bb5c-408a-898b-6ea43c40b7dd-0
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:20.840
Is it?

36f14a16-49cb-45e8-8dac-1917eb78d05e-0
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.920
So have you noticed this?

b5512b0a-686f-4d69-9d0e-e359b78236f3-0
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.291
Hmm because just the involvement with the work, total

b5512b0a-686f-4d69-9d0e-e359b78236f3-1
00:33:26.291 --> 00:33:29.869
involvement, those moments the personality becomes little

b5512b0a-686f-4d69-9d0e-e359b78236f3-2
00:33:29.869 --> 00:33:30.240
loose.

590462ca-0c1f-4561-81a6-3e1585236f3f-0
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.948
But people who are working towards a goal that they want

590462ca-0c1f-4561-81a6-3e1585236f3f-1
00:33:33.948 --> 00:33:37.120
this to happen, those people have strong personalities.

e6e31a9a-135f-4a7d-abd4-95019049d6ca-0
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.828
Always the fundamental basis for your personality, the building

e6e31a9a-135f-4a7d-abd4-95019049d6ca-1
00:33:43.828 --> 00:33:49.280
blocks for your personality, is likes and dislikes.

352d8b46-afca-4698-bba8-7d12875fe5f7-0
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.800
I like this.

065b3d3c-561d-4fda-89c7-00abdd187b11-0
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.760
I don't like this.

ef36ee4e-2d21-48be-a1e5-6398fc613674-0
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.862
A complex system of likes and dislikes is what your

ef36ee4e-2d21-48be-a1e5-6398fc613674-1
00:33:54.862 --> 00:33:56.200
personality is, isn't it?

debee9db-2257-4218-b8cd-9807ebfbdd4e-0
00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.800
See what's the difference between you and the next person?

c81bcd44-c6c0-4d81-8084-7e6964f5e0a3-0
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.360
Your likes and dislikes are different, isn't it?

024e03a2-2ee6-4d08-b5b5-7fe0f873ad96-0
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.648
Now the basis of yoga is just this help you beyond dislikes

024e03a2-2ee6-4d08-b5b5-7fe0f873ad96-1
00:34:09.648 --> 00:34:10.760
and dislikes.

4843f663-41ca-4c1e-a2b4-716f2139158c-0
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.864
Whether we are talking responsibility or inevitability

4843f663-41ca-4c1e-a2b4-716f2139158c-1
00:34:15.864 --> 00:34:18.160
or whatever else we are talking.

a96b9979-f0be-4882-bd9f-493d8b4a7c5c-0
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.000
Fundamentally it is to destroy the process of like and dislike.

d8b3ad9a-22f2-4b44-be56-4ac752b436a3-0
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.541
See, existing in the world with likes and dislikes is a very

d8b3ad9a-22f2-4b44-be56-4ac752b436a3-1
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:27.720
foolish way to exist.

92338a4f-9bbc-48fe-95b6-122f07ade612-0
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.320
But unfortunately the logical mind thinks I'll do what I like.

8509c0bc-968a-4a1b-b623-7b156a8cb725-0
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.360
This is my freedom.

d6d88cbb-0d95-42ea-b2cb-820f82bb8b8a-0
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.219
Very basis of your ******* is in your likes and dislikes, but

d6d88cbb-0d95-42ea-b2cb-820f82bb8b8a-1
00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:43.632
your mind makes you believe doing what you like is your

d6d88cbb-0d95-42ea-b2cb-820f82bb8b8a-2
00:34:43.632 --> 00:34:44.119
freedom.

36348675-dbb2-411b-ba0c-2ab8a9819809-0
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.160
Isn't it all the time?

d43fef83-2e42-4847-8a5a-3b9ccd7e1b2b-0
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.268
Everywhere in the world people believe doing what I like is

d43fef83-2e42-4847-8a5a-3b9ccd7e1b2b-1
00:34:50.268 --> 00:34:50.640
freedom.

47d147d9-3838-4929-872f-505201bae120-0
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.840
Please look at it carefully.

51251ea3-477f-433a-9e18-93d2a8855edd-0
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.489
The very fundamental basis of your ******* is in like and

51251ea3-477f-433a-9e18-93d2a8855edd-1
00:34:57.489 --> 00:34:58.120
dislike.

09f97218-c408-4b11-bffe-fecf9ec07f81-0
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.680
To operate sensibly here, even in the physical realm.

6b546e10-7a91-4f6b-a023-5addfbfc895b-0
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.950
I'm saying even to operate with your work, Oregon family,

6b546e10-7a91-4f6b-a023-5addfbfc895b-1
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.000
whatever likes and dislikes make you do stupid things.

cc01cdc1-3064-4318-8e90-a3ae08c0d7b0-0
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.440
I like this person.

f95c0c3f-3183-4f86-b6ee-5a470ebfcad7-0
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.080
I don't like this person now.

5aaff0b0-cce4-43b2-af29-13d10ef5266b-0
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.600
I cannot function from what is needed in this moment, isn't it?

8922e26c-5208-4230-ab16-8acd6fcaaf03-0
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.560
Isn't it?

221312fc-a8e4-4eb7-8b71-e1b876590b22-0
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.040
So now I don't like this person.

5fc4dfa5-a868-425a-bdb8-cfde86762285-0
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.397
Even if this person is doing something wonderful, I cannot

5fc4dfa5-a868-425a-bdb8-cfde86762285-1
00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:33.160
see it anymore.

1b0879b5-75ee-4117-b0f6-2c1b5a42f1c2-0
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.640
Do you see this happening to yourself?

481169fc-7b9d-4a74-9863-854ee7616665-0
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.320
I like this person, even if they're doing terrible things.

b7b92c10-a1a0-461f-a593-de052211c405-0
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.560
I cannot see it anymore.

503a6bc0-f62c-4f63-872a-5ef5698bb9ff-0
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.280
Isn't it so?

9a3a50fe-bbf1-4902-a49c-68b95de84e09-0
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.540
Because the moment you get trapped in this like and

9a3a50fe-bbf1-4902-a49c-68b95de84e09-1
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.720
dislike, you have no discretion.

5399003c-10e3-44b8-b94d-7f7fa24062a6-0
00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.360
You lost your discretion.

9cec89c9-dd17-4342-be3b-1235791803fb-0
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.360
Your intelligence is forsaken.

72723384-0ee5-47f7-bb5c-7a09c160212f-0
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.392
Your awareness is simply impossible once you get trapped

72723384-0ee5-47f7-bb5c-7a09c160212f-1
00:35:58.392 --> 00:35:59.640
in likes and dislikes.

7fe955b9-15d3-4aff-9475-7cda14f40af1-0
00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.798
The moment you say I like this, getting identified with it is

7fe955b9-15d3-4aff-9475-7cda14f40af1-1
00:36:04.798 --> 00:36:05.720
very normal.

ba226e22-8d9f-41ad-85e6-1e59693d3957-0
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.800
It's a natural process.

dff60f97-c06d-4dac-b428-91aa27df1b3b-0
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.443
You don't have to say I'm going to identify with this light

dff60f97-c06d-4dac-b428-91aa27df1b3b-1
00:36:12.443 --> 00:36:12.760
bulb.

929f96f9-7b6e-4846-8889-8b03f2590029-0
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.000
If you just say I like this light bulb, you get identified

929f96f9-7b6e-4846-8889-8b03f2590029-1
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.440
with it.

c22f6b71-5b89-4dc2-9516-5c2fba9be69e-0
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.120
The process will just happen.

f89738f5-e74f-4c9b-9929-c58da53c43f7-0
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.189
See, life is set up in such a way for you so that life happens

f89738f5-e74f-4c9b-9929-c58da53c43f7-1
00:36:24.189 --> 00:36:25.200
automatically.

569dbcf6-46c4-4a15-b1b0-ed7719ec5485-0
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.960
You just have to sit here and enjoy the bounty of life.

600b4990-f915-4c2d-aa0b-1e153a29218b-0
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.470
Now the problem is we are setting this forth in a wrong

600b4990-f915-4c2d-aa0b-1e153a29218b-1
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.920
direction, so it is creating suffering.

1945668e-57d6-46cd-bbb6-141f3f4b5ee5-0
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.200
Suppose if it was all in your hands.

6a0ecd69-4a5b-4dda-b301-a0cafc0e6c9d-0
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.000
You have to like it.

c2659aab-f323-4afe-82c1-53aa840626bb-0
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.920
You have to get involved with it.

6d33a2c2-476f-421a-8b97-be2043717e20-0
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.480
It's everything is yours.

724f901b-57c6-4691-9d09-942668962e7e-0
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.000
It would be a terrible effort to live, isn't it?

fecf557b-17e3-4b0c-b788-98b7aa8ecce8-0
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.560
Now it's all set up.

30b3854a-71ba-4821-a0d5-4cc4f16d61ef-0
00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.440
Well, you know, the whole software is so well set up.

7b31ee1d-4477-46fc-a365-9f3a91de9d1a-0
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.033
If you just say I like this, getting involved in it, get

7b31ee1d-4477-46fc-a365-9f3a91de9d1a-1
00:36:55.033 --> 00:36:58.115
dreaming about it, this, that that everything just happens by

7b31ee1d-4477-46fc-a365-9f3a91de9d1a-2
00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:58.960
itself, isn't it?

60003e9b-80f8-4d64-bd51-1619fbdfbfa9-0
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.077
Everything that is necessary to take you in that direction just

60003e9b-80f8-4d64-bd51-1619fbdfbfa9-1
00:37:03.077 --> 00:37:03.920
happens, isn't it?

69602765-7385-4208-8905-d9ac99369076-0
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.280
So.

ca952947-d57c-462e-a46f-c5315434a00e-0
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:11.440
So this is just life assisting you, but it has no discretion.

6deb3e0d-a1c3-4754-9faf-5aca1556ad6c-0
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.280
If you like hell, it'll take you to hell.

c2551d12-aaba-467a-8f3a-5fb29ea912f6-0
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:27.211
It happened once, Sadhguru, you call a person who hires people

c2551d12-aaba-467a-8f3a-5fb29ea912f6-1
00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:38.663
in a corporation or whatever,
HR, HR, OK, the HR director in a

c2551d12-aaba-467a-8f3a-5fb29ea912f6-2
00:37:38.663 --> 00:37:46.480
corporation died and went to heaven there.

78be56eb-d860-4668-af85-79475af60eb9-0
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.360
Saint Peter said.

384f4d3a-7f57-471a-8381-7b54f9636de1-0
00:37:52.960 --> 00:38:00.837
See, because you're the first HR
person to come to heaven, we

384f4d3a-7f57-471a-8381-7b54f9636de1-1
00:38:00.837 --> 00:38:03.760
will give you a choice.

f06c9844-8123-4269-be3e-78af1311fce5-0
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.923
If you want, you can stay in heaven because you got the

f06c9844-8123-4269-be3e-78af1311fce5-1
00:38:10.923 --> 00:38:11.560
passport.

6f9afe67-526f-4c85-a8cd-d3206f8afcd8-0
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.097
But before you go to heaven, if you want, you can have a view of

6f9afe67-526f-4c85-a8cd-d3206f8afcd8-1
00:38:18.097 --> 00:38:18.480
hell.

d80587d0-1b33-4bbf-8be7-2fdd0c905b3e-0
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.960
If you wish to stay there, you can also stay there.

363aaa2e-4dfe-45ef-b523-856d7220462e-0
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.880
This is a lady HR person.

0c642d38-3208-4643-823c-9954954f8a1b-0
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.280
She said no.

f1635b7f-cf53-4fa6-b8c2-f3e2ad0b5f95-0
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.640
Why would I want to go to hell?

27a86878-b1cd-4b08-9e9d-655bc836eb00-0
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.320
I want to go to heaven, he said.

b4fb86cf-6b39-4a60-a0e8-b448c7a0333e-0
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.040
Why wouldn't you want to have a look at it?

7589d85e-6f68-46fb-b616-dfc53233750e-0
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:36.320
He said OK, She got in the elevator, went dreaming down.

9737b49f-a6f9-4204-b82e-62e16ae42727-0
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.148
Then the elevator doors opened and it opened into a beautiful

9737b49f-a6f9-4204-b82e-62e16ae42727-1
00:38:46.148 --> 00:38:48.800
garden on the poolside.

7660e6d3-398d-4a6f-90ac-667fe4681c18-0
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.720
Very beautiful.

40f6ed04-6995-4632-a952-12fb86bf707b-0
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.480
People are swimming, like, you know, sunbathing.

14f50b46-4754-48ec-bf35-4f2273f3117d-0
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.603
And there's a wonderful golf course and then a nice

14f50b46-4754-48ec-bf35-4f2273f3117d-1
00:38:56.603 --> 00:38:57.720
clubhouse, the works.

7f60aae3-0354-4533-9b06-b825a77b74c7-0
00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:02.760
See now, this is great hell.

cd9e8ae7-0ff2-4dde-b6a7-79a52841bdcc-0
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.120
She had a view of that.

5561c70d-286d-4943-8721-3fece1243d3a-0
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:12.125
And then Saint Peter said, OK, you have a view of heaven, then

5561c70d-286d-4943-8721-3fece1243d3a-1
00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:13.000
you choose.

0502d5a1-054a-4406-b502-ac88eef7414a-0
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.200
Then she got in the elevator, It went up.

2528a67f-8b4c-4303-ad0f-644f0c6121ef-0
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.800
Supposed to be down and up.

ebcf941a-8422-479a-9b2f-c803180dd1e1-0
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.000
OK, that's a direction.

1b5c1f09-f8bf-40b3-92f0-319283ae86ef-0
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:37.840
At least you better know now we're down South there.

058fbdde-848e-4776-ae3d-d8ffbf73b004-0
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.703
They opened the doors and then she saw lots of clouds, people

058fbdde-848e-4776-ae3d-d8ffbf73b004-1
00:39:41.703 --> 00:39:44.320
just floating in the clouds playing harp.

8d5744bb-7532-4ce0-9626-e102141c45a8-0
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:50.839
And you know, she said, OK, this is also fine, but I think I'll

8d5744bb-7532-4ce0-9626-e102141c45a8-1
00:39:50.839 --> 00:39:51.960
go to hell.

b2ae83dd-2be4-4d10-867c-1640c35b6cce-0
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.680
All my friends are there, this golf.

c8d30dfd-88ee-4da3-a78e-2fd5ec65ce9c-0
00:39:59.400 --> 00:39:59.920
I'll go.

d2b5f777-9639-43de-9e2e-ce1827cbbfd9-0
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.560
So they put her in the elevator.

46b358f8-ffd9-4ddc-8482-8364dc20f292-0
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.560
She just went down and again the doors open.

64d634ef-99df-473a-93ba-d9b59d05e442-0
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.200
It was a harsh desert.

89f002da-12d4-4cac-a76c-4a3bd7d87156-0
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.400
Everybody all dried up without food, in terrible condition.

59a66a7e-ab53-4272-808f-d8dd5ca5bad5-0
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.000
Everything, she said.

bfeb0ef1-9a36-4608-983f-453b7ca68a1a-0
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
What is this?

c5e044ee-23d4-479e-93a6-040d927ecd84-0
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.982
Last time when I came, there was a garden, there was a pool,

c5e044ee-23d4-479e-93a6-040d927ecd84-1
00:40:27.982 --> 00:40:29.360
there was a golf course.

494991ea-77c3-495b-8c34-856bb933d8c8-0
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.080
What happened?

3a9cdbf8-6094-4b7c-bbed-389af3c38149-0
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:44.446
So they said that was just the first day, you know, now your

3a9cdbf8-6094-4b7c-bbed-389af3c38149-1
00:40:44.446 --> 00:40:49.840
staff, that was the interview.

769762d6-b178-40e0-a7b2-bf9cdf4b0532-0
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.840
Now your staff, all your life, you did this to people.

30ca4c0f-7e6d-4141-9ede-579990a17c9a-0
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:09.080
So this is your choice, your personality.

093a48b4-42a4-47b5-8520-67667d05272e-0
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:18.318
I don't know if you're working in places, at least if you're

093a48b4-42a4-47b5-8520-67667d05272e-1
00:41:18.318 --> 00:41:18.600
HR.

c41bf6ac-74a7-41b5-b3a7-4394a41ebeea-0
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.520
Is there anybody HR?

9ec4d549-1bf0-4dc6-82e0-66d44fbb2b73-0
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:27.920
Oh, especially if you're HR, maybe you.

224848dd-8606-41b7-b662-689edabb36d7-0
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.941
Also, you're supposed to size up a person, you know, somebody new

224848dd-8606-41b7-b662-689edabb36d7-1
00:41:33.941 --> 00:41:36.040
walks into your office.

1ed4514d-79b2-4b91-80ff-b009d7008b9d-0
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.650
You're supposed to size them up where they will fit into this

1ed4514d-79b2-4b91-80ff-b009d7008b9d-1
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.520
whole machine of an organization.

3b60bf27-6b24-404b-8658-8f3ecd43bc4e-0
00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:49.480
So if you're willing to look, people's personalities are

3b60bf27-6b24-404b-8658-8f3ecd43bc4e-1
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.280
always hanging out.

492882cb-e519-4bfc-9e00-c44737183e9c-0
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.480
You know they need not say anything.

2079904b-d3e2-4c22-9072-6208a8583584-0
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.520
They need not do anything if you just look at them properly.

1662b5dc-6cdf-4ed0-a217-7c5e1d48d028-0
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.680
The very way they stand, sit.

7c22cfd8-2f3a-48bf-82a3-240709270241-0
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.240
You don't need any great yogic intuition.

46f5bf49-c0c2-4ee8-b478-21e8e290f7cb-0
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.280
Simply a simple observation of a person.

b8db76e4-2d9a-4d0b-b991-f088d21ad5ec-0
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.786
The very way they stand, the way they hold their hands, the way

b8db76e4-2d9a-4d0b-b991-f088d21ad5ec-1
00:42:10.786 --> 00:42:13.910
they smile, the way they do things, their personality is

b8db76e4-2d9a-4d0b-b991-f088d21ad5ec-2
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.280
just hanging out of them.

f581ff84-98c6-4c53-963a-be7af2d7f18c-0
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.806
So it's so obvious to everybody except yourself, you know,

f581ff84-98c6-4c53-963a-be7af2d7f18c-1
00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:25.680
That's the whole thing.

641e93a5-cd7e-48b6-942d-4a54deb15d80-0
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.680
Sadhguru, you are my perfect mirror.

908e494b-6c47-441c-a200-a83abc97c729-0
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.400
You show me what I'm not in.

0f2508fc-7502-42d2-a879-b5ab8597369e-0
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.400
The endless bit of what wants was made.

2f1797b7-7001-4762-85c0-445049721002-0
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.960
Layer and layer.

d762d8d4-6fa7-40c3-ab45-6b46d99b861d-0
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:59.520
You peel off me the pain it is but the joy it brings.

923fb614-7033-404e-b77a-1a2ddc27f9ac-0
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:07.875
So thank you for showing me what
I'm not for showing me what I

923fb614-7033-404e-b77a-1a2ddc27f9ac-1
00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:08.920
could be.

4b0e54bc-d04f-48fd-82eb-729ee0020791-0
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:38.986
Thank you endlessly, but if I
could only just be you could

4b0e54bc-d04f-48fd-82eb-729ee0020791-1
00:43:38.986 --> 00:44:09.080
show me all the things I would be willing enough to see the.
