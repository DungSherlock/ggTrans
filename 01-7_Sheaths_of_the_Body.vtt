25525dce-dda1-4f51-8aed-eb053eed06ed-0
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.286
So the body or this what you call as yourself, evolves itself

25525dce-dda1-4f51-8aed-eb053eed06ed-1
00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.160
in many different stages.

06563ba9-29cd-4f58-8927-f37eadc763d2-0
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.660
Looking at this evolution in yoga, we see this as seven

06563ba9-29cd-4f58-8927-f37eadc763d2-1
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.140
different stages, or we say 7 different bodies.

473cdb5a-173a-46a3-9a81-547c8449f30f-0
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.572
Man has seven different bodies need not necessarily mean

473cdb5a-173a-46a3-9a81-547c8449f30f-1
00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:36.500
actually seven different bodies.

5814783f-a362-462a-bfda-d15f1ced7bde-0
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.992
These are seven different stages in which one grows from zero to

5814783f-a362-462a-bfda-d15f1ced7bde-1
00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:44.460
seven up to seven years of age.

a709eb19-c673-4ddf-a380-412edfa5f1e8-0
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.340
Only the physical body grows.

46beab13-a6f9-46fa-85b9-badb93f86cb7-0
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.746
It is very important that a person's physical body grows

46beab13-a6f9-46fa-85b9-badb93f86cb7-1
00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:51.540
properly in these seven years.

7e4f66c4-d97f-47c5-a779-15d5db0b40de-0
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.555
If the necessary growth does not happen in this first seven

7e4f66c4-d97f-47c5-a779-15d5db0b40de-1
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.290
years, this person will never be physically healthy.

6c61cabb-56d0-46c3-8fcc-141d1e25d640-0
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.650
It doesn't matter.

5de97099-2b37-4d66-a8a1-8f64ef8620ea-0
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.560
He may manage, he may manage to live, but he will never know

5de97099-2b37-4d66-a8a1-8f64ef8620ea-1
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.330
true health.

4f3dc5c9-0109-4c0e-86a3-f1e0195a7820-0
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.110
He will never be, you know, carefree healthfulness will

4f3dc5c9-0109-4c0e-86a3-f1e0195a7820-1
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.616
never come to him if he doesn't achieve physical growth in seven

4f3dc5c9-0109-4c0e-86a3-f1e0195a7820-2
00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:12.210
years time.

994c2c89-1cd8-4a25-b8b8-49ca539a93c6-0
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.792
This is Tul Sharif or the grass body 7 to 14, another body which

994c2c89-1cd8-4a25-b8b8-49ca539a93c6-1
00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:22.650
is called as Bhava Sharif.

2a85c694-b61d-4ba7-b1f7-79188e7d78c7-0
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.357
The emotional development of a person happens by the time they

2a85c694-b61d-4ba7-b1f7-79188e7d78c7-1
00:01:27.357 --> 00:01:28.030
reach 14.

188d700d-245d-4da8-8d6a-8716edb2464c-0
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.967
They attain to sexual maturity and emotionally they are in a

188d700d-245d-4da8-8d6a-8716edb2464c-1
00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.070
certain state between 7 and 14.

436a2283-c0fd-4962-929a-cae94053f5f4-0
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.318
You can see a child growing emotionally till seven he

436a2283-c0fd-4962-929a-cae94053f5f4-1
00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:42.047
doesn't have much emotions but from 7 to 14 slowly he becomes

436a2283-c0fd-4962-929a-cae94053f5f4-2
00:01:42.047 --> 00:01:43.190
an emotional being.

d2ebcf89-ee50-44ee-8427-593b27f25e60-0
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.750
The Bawa Sharir evolves from here.

e0cbbecc-ea82-49a2-a00b-922f73364d77-0
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.510
So when he comes here, his emotion becomes important.

bc9ebb74-5f0b-4f6f-b63e-ca4fba27e8e8-0
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.230
Sexuality is also one of the basic emotions.

dc656abb-9c6e-4855-9e20-f22c113271f5-0
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.642
That's why it becomes very important when he attends to

dc656abb-9c6e-4855-9e20-f22c113271f5-1
00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:57.030
this age.

6588a106-3177-4256-a7d3-8a36c2c9b8d4-0
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.956
Because the Bhava Sharir is developing that point from 14 to

6588a106-3177-4256-a7d3-8a36c2c9b8d4-1
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:08.340
21 next seven years, the Manasik Sharif or the mental body

6588a106-3177-4256-a7d3-8a36c2c9b8d4-2
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.070
evolves.

1dcf294d-b904-4e59-b16f-fbd241961ca8-0
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.430
That is when the intellect develops.

e6ae1ef0-6eb7-4328-a515-97c96101f445-0
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.681
Once bhava is properly established, then intellect

e6ae1ef0-6eb7-4328-a515-97c96101f445-1
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:20.750
evolves, Education and other things come at.

e26ea7f5-1fde-48e2-8428-8796edb99ba7-0
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.110
You know, the peak of our education comes between 14 to

e26ea7f5-1fde-48e2-8428-8796edb99ba7-1
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.070
say 21, because that is the only time really man can grasp things

e26ea7f5-1fde-48e2-8428-8796edb99ba7-2
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.790
intellectually, the amount of learning that he can do at that

e26ea7f5-1fde-48e2-8428-8796edb99ba7-3
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.690
time later on or before that it is not really possible except in

e26ea7f5-1fde-48e2-8428-8796edb99ba7-4
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.310
a few extraordinary beings.

2b07c4e2-af94-4d53-a546-8cbc427e861f-0
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.816
Generally for most average human beings the maximum learning

2b07c4e2-af94-4d53-a546-8cbc427e861f-1
00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.390
happens between 14 to 21 years of age.

830b6677-8119-4d3f-a4b8-d85e7a782c25-0
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.840
So Manasik sharir or the mental body develops.

0b6bb670-30fe-4e33-8d5d-c0eae7131bc3-0
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.504
Today's modern world is created in such a way that only these

0b6bb670-30fe-4e33-8d5d-c0eae7131bc3-1
00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:54.480
three things happen.

1c7a410f-7138-4720-a5c0-931ccb64d665-0
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.040
Suppose only physical body evolved.

700a698f-0fca-487f-916d-833fff0c284f-0
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.600
The Bhav sharir did not develop properly.

25d77314-a757-429c-be21-e04203440909-0
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.058
That person only food and sleep will be the main things for him

25d77314-a757-429c-be21-e04203440909-1
00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.240
only physical body.

3f47ca18-ad7c-4a83-a960-39cb0f029385-0
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.840
He knows if he evolves only till bhav sharir.

290475f1-a662-4722-85ba-c41e6b7f8e95-0
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.640
And his mental body does not develop.

744921d9-9e00-4f3c-be2b-83944294b2cc-0
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.514
If his intellect does not evolve, then you will see

744921d9-9e00-4f3c-be2b-83944294b2cc-1
00:03:14.514 --> 00:03:17.810
sexuality will be the most powerful thing in that person.

43746dc5-0162-4a8f-bb7d-9c641df7034f-0
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.410
All kinds of perversions will arise out of this.

3bf33279-f2a8-4ec3-897f-1068bfb14706-0
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.139
When intellect develops his interest to learn all these

3bf33279-f2a8-4ec3-897f-1068bfb14706-1
00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.090
things will come.

0ef9acd8-59ce-49c0-ac0a-cd612ccc66d3-0
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.212
But generally today modern society is limited only to these

0ef9acd8-59ce-49c0-ac0a-cd612ccc66d3-1
00:03:30.212 --> 00:03:34.070
three states of the body, the physical body, the emotional

0ef9acd8-59ce-49c0-ac0a-cd612ccc66d3-2
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.770
body, and the mental body.

589a05cf-56be-4b80-936b-80f9e53b6024-0
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.250
After that we are not seeking any development.

1c148812-5962-43eb-9d91-3c2e0d4ec521-0
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.780
The next seven years are for Divya Manas.

a755e674-b756-47ce-a69d-933f198c50b6-0
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.378
As you have a logical mind, there's another mind which is

a755e674-b756-47ce-a69d-933f198c50b6-1
00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:48.580
completely different.

87a91016-3743-4968-85d1-765c667f5313-0
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.855
In yoga, we avoid this fourth level of development because

87a91016-3743-4968-85d1-765c667f5313-1
00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:57.580
once you person goes into this, he becomes miraculous.

dcdf953b-6279-41e4-ba42-a5c8d0ca24a3-0
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.180
Many, many miracles start happening around him.

5d93f5f4-b2eb-479b-a264-9c90b20fd919-0
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.500
What is there can be here, what is here can be there.

40b3fdac-6ca2-40cd-a362-ea66f0067efb-0
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.700
You know what is happening there.

6c69ee01-c222-4740-8214-c1a416f48864-0
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.140
These kind of things.

1d99639d-947a-44b5-8e68-8ad0860f22cd-0
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.500
In yoga, we seal this route.

c31dc7e5-1f09-4ad4-8d7b-815359bc8c4b-0
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.365
We don't allow people to go into Divya Manas because it is still

c31dc7e5-1f09-4ad4-8d7b-815359bc8c4b-1
00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:12.730
mind.

c80d770f-5af7-4d49-82dc-752208d24528-0
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.690
It may be Divya means it's a grand mind.

0fa9919c-d919-4020-bf6d-9cbce13a5765-0
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.930
You know mind on a much grander scale than that we know.

2810df9d-aed4-4a31-a3c7-3ebe6931f270-0
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.412
As mind is, once you enter this mind, you know everything you

2810df9d-aed4-4a31-a3c7-3ebe6931f270-1
00:04:26.412 --> 00:04:27.890
know, not everything.

d851838f-9c45-4355-8278-4d4f83fed712-0
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.730
But when compared to other people, you look like a miracle.

c1904ece-c186-4f0d-919b-3564714903b3-0
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.243
Once this happens, people generally lose the next stage of

c1904ece-c186-4f0d-919b-3564714903b3-1
00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:38.170
development.

82803df1-bf66-474e-b9ee-16a25efe0cf7-0
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.146
Most people will not have the maturity to just push it aside

82803df1-bf66-474e-b9ee-16a25efe0cf7-1
00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:44.130
and go ahead.

94c1c093-b640-41ab-83bd-0a8b19e125cd-0
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.290
They will always get entangled with this.

b9ac7f6b-09ae-4ae3-ac60-86f62d24bedf-0
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.490
This is still a psychic state.

6fa68b55-c641-4c8e-a80d-02a4125ef75a-0
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.313
Now you can do telepathy, you can do Tele kindnesses, all

6fa68b55-c641-4c8e-a80d-02a4125ef75a-1
00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:53.090
these things.

6539b736-6188-45f4-b45f-6cb4cd202698-0
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.450
These are Divya manas.

8f7a8117-163d-4b4e-bbbd-9bc95c5e5df5-0
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.850
From 21 to 28.

691f91ac-85b9-4a8f-8bcd-cc56fbe4a8f0-0
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.490
This mind can be easily developed.

dc6f4d4c-42ed-48d8-9be9-0ecb057619aa-0
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.730
This is a natural process.

dc19deec-1f98-4572-a7c7-7104e4e72a80-0
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.952
At that stage it is very easy to develop that point, that kind of

dc19deec-1f98-4572-a7c7-7104e4e72a80-1
00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:04.450
ability.

d26b22a2-e9bf-4354-8e85-c0c056c44b6a-0
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.275
But people who are on the spiritual path should never seek

d26b22a2-e9bf-4354-8e85-c0c056c44b6a-1
00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:15.372
that, because all that will end up with is a higher level of the

d26b22a2-e9bf-4354-8e85-c0c056c44b6a-2
00:05:15.372 --> 00:05:16.470
mind as it is.

4183c079-4398-4d0e-8acb-ca261c00be82-0
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.390
Mind is deceptive.

8b7d7f0b-210c-4d2a-901c-3fbe9303c4c3-0
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.710
A higher mind is even more deceptive.

5da77748-41f8-462f-95f8-b14ca54ea3f7-0
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.430
It gets you entangled in a much deeper way than the lower mind.

deecba4a-7c4f-43fb-acb3-b5735f776730-0
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.350
So we just keep that aside.

7a6a9381-f0c3-43e4-bf61-beeefddf7a35-0
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.510
This has happened in the past in so many ways, especially people

7a6a9381-f0c3-43e4-bf61-beeefddf7a35-1
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.590
walking the tantric paths.

9cfae513-37eb-40f5-baf9-ab4fc281e5e5-0
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:43.544
They always get entangled with Divya Manasa because they need

9cfae513-37eb-40f5-baf9-ab4fc281e5e5-1
00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:46.330
it to do their work.

691b85ea-9c3d-4307-9855-f3377a4d6f85-0
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.010
The nature of the work is such they need this divyumanas.

a2290b62-9df5-4b1c-8b9f-497ab826ded3-0
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.370
Once they use it, they get enamored by it.

c07a1308-7e6e-47ff-809c-451fed3f22b2-0
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.039
It is more attractive than anything that you know in your

c07a1308-7e6e-47ff-809c-451fed3f22b2-1
00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.410
life because you know you can do things little bit.

26451141-2644-482c-94bc-4db886831050-0
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.316
If you can start communicating with somebody just like that,

26451141-2644-482c-94bc-4db886831050-1
00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:09.290
you wouldn't like to stop that, isn't it?

6d4c4886-9018-4a2a-b02e-614e591c622b-0
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.931
If you can move things without putting your hands to it, you

6d4c4886-9018-4a2a-b02e-614e591c622b-1
00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:23.474
wouldn't like to stop that because the tantric practices

6d4c4886-9018-4a2a-b02e-614e591c622b-2
00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:25.770
involve Divya manas.

dbbf89e2-c049-41c9-9667-2bbf70cc301e-0
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.250
Without it, they cannot do anything.

cdd8e6ac-ed03-4d08-8ad7-726b454856f8-0
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.426
So there is always this danger that they usually have a setup

cdd8e6ac-ed03-4d08-8ad7-726b454856f8-1
00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:38.157
where the guru or the master who is there, keeps control,

cdd8e6ac-ed03-4d08-8ad7-726b454856f8-2
00:06:38.157 --> 00:06:40.930
complete control over their mind.

913a022a-3cc0-46cc-a16f-5a777cbc1ae9-0
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.850
Only in certain situations they can use their mind.

ad95a4dd-403b-4d24-870c-137f0a42d48d-0
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.210
That's how they are kept.

38143ef5-204a-432a-8fc0-8cbcb8239665-0
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.321
If we go into Tantra, that is how it is essential because once

38143ef5-204a-432a-8fc0-8cbcb8239665-1
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:53.947
the temptation of Divya Manas comes, it is more attractive

38143ef5-204a-432a-8fc0-8cbcb8239665-2
00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:57.450
than anything that you know people would want to use it.

e33bc2aa-348a-4305-b59b-39ed70222158-0
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.530
People would want to be with it because it looks like absolute.

e0c47ee8-3a67-4502-82ab-4b20a6c08d88-0
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.490
Nobody will seek the absolute once they come to contact with

e0c47ee8-3a67-4502-82ab-4b20a6c08d88-1
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.050
Divya Manas because it is so huge, so vast, so miraculous.

e5efe9e5-4c14-4920-ac27-c53a90753cf5-0
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.530
It feels like God.

890ef396-670d-464a-ad00-1862718b883d-0
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.210
You don't need anything more.

c894654a-b9e3-46f0-b351-900ac1e854d6-0
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.850
That's that's the kind of feeling that it creates.

a35cc46c-73e5-43e9-af35-e4d868fd1537-0
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.972
But it also brings immense suffering as normally a person

a35cc46c-73e5-43e9-af35-e4d868fd1537-1
00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:24.536
who goes into Divya manas after
4748 years of life, tremendous

a35cc46c-73e5-43e9-af35-e4d868fd1537-2
00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:27.290
amount of suffering is brought about.

ca532797-454e-4f84-ae86-0d8b8725be4f-0
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.730
The next stage of development is called Atmasarif.

e3678d95-7d68-482a-9773-01aeab919bb4-0
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.530
This is the soul or the soul body.

cc507fb4-4767-4c63-874e-fe29a44abb82-0
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.420
Normally most people think this is the ultimate nature.

dcb006ff-30e6-4d04-bff1-58d3b3f8debc-0
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.220
This is not.

33268b78-22f1-4229-9ea5-ae3985eba2b1-0
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.020
This is an absolute nature.

1b7913bc-9a65-4e76-91ff-5ba1286fc4be-0
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.740
Now we have shifted from nature as we know it.

faea9822-caa6-4d68-8735-ae97c8617b71-0
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:53.580
This stool, Sharir, Bawa Sharir manasika, sharir, Divya manas.

0899e764-0d88-44c5-b082-2f1caee27497-0
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.771
All these things are physical nature, higher and higher

0899e764-0d88-44c5-b082-2f1caee27497-1
00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:58.660
levels, subtler and subtler ways.

ba8ba39f-8e11-45bf-bdc6-e765736550f7-0
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.960
Now once you move into Atma Sharir, you have moved away from

ba8ba39f-8e11-45bf-bdc6-e765736550f7-1
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.599
physical nature and you have moved into another nature if you

ba8ba39f-8e11-45bf-bdc6-e765736550f7-2
00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:07.950
want to call it nature.

bc88d5af-629f-44db-b8b6-bf0c700f107f-0
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.187
Or let us say we have moved into non nature which is no more

bc88d5af-629f-44db-b8b6-bf0c700f107f-1
00:08:11.187 --> 00:08:11.550
nature.

83fe2018-5530-466d-8adb-3cf6f68cae09-0
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.270
Loss of nature do not hold this anymore.

d5d903de-226a-491b-a09f-6b2473aa340a-0
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.230
Normally most people understand becoming one with atmosphere.

bc08468a-4d9e-4948-8ccc-7ae9fb01aa74-0
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.790
It is everything which is not.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.070
It is a very joyful state.

ddfc3857-fb82-4b40-bcf7-56ca896f7363-0
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.122
It is a state from which one cannot fall into fall down

ddfc3857-fb82-4b40-bcf7-56ca896f7363-1
00:08:27.122 --> 00:08:27.510
again.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.150
You cross the natural limits, one cannot fall down again.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.190
But still it is not everything.

1cc96bb0-491b-404d-a073-71e53405e303-0
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.450
This is like being in heaven.

42eab4c6-d887-414b-8953-d174218aebad-0
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.130
You are in great pleasure all the time.

1f959eeb-a629-4683-abf6-198ff2911a1f-0
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.810
You are very joyous.

1a276169-c3c0-4a81-a49a-62a533d75294-0
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.450
The next stage of development is called as the cosmic body.

8a25c226-fc94-48f7-928c-544d1d15b687-0
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.650
This is in traditional terms we can say this is Paramatma.

23c5b1f5-5803-487f-bda3-561ce4d0a9a8-0
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.857
But generally most people once they attain to Atma, they even

23c5b1f5-5803-487f-bda3-561ce4d0a9a8-1
00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:58.890
deny the paramatma because it is so complete.

bbfef5c0-e145-419f-a988-319255a1bf6a-0
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:06.653
The danger of being totally stuck to Atmasari is very, very

bbfef5c0-e145-419f-a988-319255a1bf6a-1
00:09:06.653 --> 00:09:07.710
much there.

738a25a4-6e95-4c7e-b45a-2ca19dd2422d-0
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:13.790
And we have, you know, participant.

2f5ad3a2-533f-45e5-88b7-2df813363b2e-0
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.319
I don't want to put it in terms of numbers, but we have lots of

2f5ad3a2-533f-45e5-88b7-2df813363b2e-1
00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:21.950
people, so many people who are like this.

466faddc-4498-4aa4-8baf-12ac862c0dbe-0
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.390
They have become disembodied beings.

549b2e56-9b07-4482-a61e-9ad6f9e0f119-0
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.150
They are in Atmasari.

aa7df647-a52a-4794-8b54-21ed10e23e17-0
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.030
They are blissful.

da1c6ab3-a45c-46d4-ba83-52649455e770-0
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.710
The urge to seek the next has not come.

80ef2c07-608f-4e21-a6f7-eab9fee7a6fb-0
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:36.500
But till a person completely dissolves, there is no freedom.

d6ea39f5-8fdf-4569-b646-30d772f70137-0
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.300
It feels like mukti.

df532fbb-04e5-4dda-8a16-4efa2c06c789-0
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.393
It is mukti in a certain way, because you have broken the

df532fbb-04e5-4dda-8a16-4efa2c06c789-1
00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:42.140
natural cycle.

7abde9b8-c5c7-483d-a208-42cffdb6be8d-0
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.340
Now you can neither come back nor can you go somewhere.

164bba37-130e-4d78-8056-445db0755378-0
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.900
You are blissful, floating around in heavens.

b1bd1af6-f852-4f2f-a1e3-84f56cff3396-0
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.084
These are the people who have been generally described as

b1bd1af6-f852-4f2f-a1e3-84f56cff3396-1
00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:52.420
angels.

19413891-0227-48be-b9e7-dd24e33d5a95-0
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.300
This that you know all kinds of descriptions and additions.

2b6b73fc-9d10-46e9-93e8-b0ecd4c691b6-0
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.462
Wings and other things have been given to them, but fundamentally

2b6b73fc-9d10-46e9-93e8-b0ecd4c691b6-1
00:09:58.462 --> 00:10:00.140
they have crossed physical nature.

404f819e-76e8-4d07-8c1c-ee26f1637dce-0
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.450
They're in another blissful state which almost looks

404f819e-76e8-4d07-8c1c-ee26f1637dce-1
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.020
absolute.

61e9d19b-7e03-4809-9d99-ec1328b891c2-0
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.584
You have moved into absolute nature, but still it is not

61e9d19b-7e03-4809-9d99-ec1328b891c2-1
00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:09.180
everything.

da5832b0-8f24-4e60-b64a-d786587f6097-0
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.380
Knowing beyond the nature in a limited way is Artana.

f4d80510-5e2d-43f2-90c0-f188a1341c19-0
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.020
Knowing beyond the nature in an unlimited way is Paramatma.

1b1757a7-a04f-4ad0-ba2c-6cf72a9cb00e-0
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.175
Once a person attends to Atmasari generally he tends to

1b1757a7-a04f-4ad0-ba2c-6cf72a9cb00e-1
00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:22.300
deny the Paramatma.

77c129e6-9dd7-4fb4-99c0-dcb70b1ccc0f-0
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.740
That's why so many teachings have come to us.

f05372a8-e5e0-461f-b759-31c32920d6fa-0
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.013
Aatman is everything people have said because they tasted the

f05372a8-e5e0-461f-b759-31c32920d6fa-1
00:10:28.013 --> 00:10:30.020
absolute and they thought that is it.

4c103777-9739-46b1-8707-087a6e25721b-0
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.674
The next is called as Sunya Sharir or Gautama called it as

4c103777-9739-46b1-8707-087a6e25721b-1
00:10:35.674 --> 00:10:36.850
Nirvana Sharir.

8923f857-5e3d-4b50-8ab5-1b35d609abb3-0
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.170
That means complete dissolution on the path of yoga.

b85f6214-a394-41a6-85ba-ed0a593fa54b-0
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.053
We are trying to bypass a few things and go always to complete

b85f6214-a394-41a6-85ba-ed0a593fa54b-1
00:10:47.053 --> 00:10:51.497
emptiness, total dissolution, because till then the job is not

b85f6214-a394-41a6-85ba-ed0a593fa54b-2
00:10:51.497 --> 00:10:51.850
done.

e440e8b1-864f-4f8e-9296-8dd568c85cd3-0
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.536
Once we approach spirituality as a science, then we are not

e440e8b1-864f-4f8e-9296-8dd568c85cd3-1
00:10:56.536 --> 00:10:59.270
looking for entertainment on the path.

993ea6f8-bbac-4697-87c1-8774b4137810-0
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.790
A scientist is never looking for entertainment.

a80bc964-1058-4690-8d53-30c85ead8d13-0
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.270
He discovers something.

445c9912-7357-4bea-b3c0-5900bf5a27a3-0
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:09.270
He wants to make a rocket that goes to wherever another planet.

6cf5227c-38d2-4ff3-a7b0-aaaef4d3dd3a-0
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.443
But in the beginning he may start it with a little

6cf5227c-38d2-4ff3-a7b0-aaaef4d3dd3a-1
00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:15.230
fireworks.

bbdf4633-8ccb-4ecf-a04b-ab87d3700383-0
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.422
You know the little rocket what we use for the Diwali When he

bbdf4633-8ccb-4ecf-a04b-ab87d3700383-1
00:11:19.422 --> 00:11:23.430
lights it, he is only looking at it as a possibility, not as

bbdf4633-8ccb-4ecf-a04b-ab87d3700383-2
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.350
entertainment.

d243594e-846c-4f08-9db7-27d5ca1761fc-0
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.093
So similarly on the yogic path, whatever little, little things

d243594e-846c-4f08-9db7-27d5ca1761fc-1
00:11:28.093 --> 00:11:31.060
happen, we are only looking at it as a stepping stone for

d243594e-846c-4f08-9db7-27d5ca1761fc-2
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.800
something bigger that can happen.

2d03e9c6-7081-4594-9283-224891a43e5a-0
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.986
We are never looking at it as a big entertainment and getting

2d03e9c6-7081-4594-9283-224891a43e5a-1
00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:36.840
enamored with that.

620641b2-fec0-4cb2-b3f7-a7b4695df81c-0
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.240
It is very, very important.

fd386e30-b072-4e74-a428-246f56be06ae-0
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.280
Little people feel like this in meditation.

4ddcbc4d-8fc7-4853-87e7-f9305b8c2079-0
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.830
They are thrilled and you find within two months they're again

4ddcbc4d-8fc7-4853-87e7-f9305b8c2079-1
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.080
down.

99c3f582-fc5a-4dd3-88f5-d8c2055c6831-0
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.581
You know this is happening repeatedly because you get

99c3f582-fc5a-4dd3-88f5-d8c2055c6831-1
00:11:48.581 --> 00:11:49.360
entertained.

f4de0cd1-1e61-4b7f-b6c6-197d066f5005-0
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.502
Don't get entertained with what is happening, what what is

f4de0cd1-1e61-4b7f-b6c6-197d066f5005-1
00:11:52.502 --> 00:11:52.960
happening.

a17f46de-4524-4ab5-829d-4d3f7a821e64-0
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.050
Our thing is only to reach the goal.

2315172d-cea3-49d5-9c7e-5dcf6cd06b86-0
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.570
Our thing is not to get caught up with the fair on the way.

ebaa9721-486b-4af0-9dc5-59c954d80ab0-0
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.570
If you go into the fair on the way, you never go to the end.

519a9f9d-6ca9-40f1-95af-0c32e8b1f038-0
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.201
You are moving at the maximum pace that you can move, and you

519a9f9d-6ca9-40f1-95af-0c32e8b1f038-1
00:12:10.201 --> 00:12:11.890
are moving in the right direction.

1f81510e-0a9a-4428-b340-f99eb133f154-0
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.210
That's all that matters to me.

462fd23c-a38a-41ed-8711-3a28b4963517-0
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.857
Once a person has chosen the spiritual path, the way he sits,

462fd23c-a38a-41ed-8711-3a28b4963517-1
00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:20.328
the way he stands, the way he is, the way he speaks, the way

462fd23c-a38a-41ed-8711-3a28b4963517-2
00:12:20.328 --> 00:12:23.969
he thinks and the way he lives, everything has to be spiritual.

d36c4702-6ed6-4d76-b1ed-3926db10b153-0
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.850
So every aspect of our life has to become yoga.

49838edd-afff-489c-8c5d-418f30d7e7f5-0
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.730
Every aspect of life has to become a process of growth.
