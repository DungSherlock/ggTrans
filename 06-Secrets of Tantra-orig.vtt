00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.820
So, what's generally being done as past life regression

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.600
is essentially a psychological process.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.460
You don’t touch anything past life that way.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.040
It is just that even within the mind that you have right now

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.220
there are so many layers to this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.100
which never comes into your access.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.540
You know there are schizophrenic people

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.360
the recorded number actually there could be more.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.260
Medically well documented number is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.220
there have been people who have managed 32 different personalities

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.820
in the same person, complete people.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.580
One man being 32 different people.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.420
These are clinically well recorded cases

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.700
there could be more.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.360
For you as a person

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.620
for you to be the person that you are

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.140
you have so much complexity of thought, emotion, this, that.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.020
Just imagine 32 like this within you, your mind can effortlessly handle it.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.520
If you ask me how many are possible, I would say 84 million personalities you can do.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.440
You can do that much or more because the mind has come with that much capability.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.700
It is never really used.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.760
A schizophrenic is probably using his mental capacity far more than a so-called normal person.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.300
So the complexity of what the mind is, is such

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.800
that it can create different levels of experience for you.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.240
Mind is such, right now you are here in Tibet.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.340
You just saw a few things of Tibetan life.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.320
With this your mind can take this information

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.860
and build a whole new Tibet within you, if you want.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.740
See people are writing books, you know?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.060
Somebody came to Tibet for 10 days, he goes back and writes 500 pages

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.340
which you read for 10 days

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.500
and it looks like a world by itself.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.420
He was here only for 10 days.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.520
Now he created a whole new Tibet in his mind.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.940
All of it may not be true, but it doesn’t matter.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.300
From the little information he got, he just multiplied it in his mind in so many different ways

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.320
and it may not be too totally off either, from the reality.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.700
It may be slightly off

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.400
but it's still Tibet.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.140
So, if I show you anything. You saw me now. Just using me as a subject

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.120
you can write 1000 pages if you want.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.600
Human beings have the capability, isn't it?

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.440
Yes?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.280
Some have developed it, some have not, but it is there in every human being.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.040
So if I just give you one thought

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.300
with that thought you can build a whole life.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.920
This is the whole art of Tantra.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.820
Tantra means just this using the mind in such a way

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.220
that you create such elaborate detail of everything.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.460
Now we could just work.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.140
You have a little flower or something?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.260
The kriya and the pranayam and whatever the Shakthi Chalana Kriya

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.480
another thing that you are doing, are still very simple ones.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.700
There are more complex ways of using your mind.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.140
Even in this, you need to use your mind

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.300
I am sure right now atleast 60% of people can never get their 7 cycles right

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.540
Yes? Am I right?

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.240
Am I being cruel on you?

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.380
All you have to do is count upto 28. You know?

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.820
7 cycles, 4 mudras

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.140
I would say atleast 60% of the people won't get it right.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.860
They always get mixed up, beyond 3,4 they are gone.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.260
When I watch a person doing it, I know they are gone.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.400
If you do it everyday, everyday

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.780
now you train you mind in a certain way.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.980
This is too much creation for you.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.480
I wanted something more simple, but okay

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.240
Okay, this is just

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.340
let's take it here. Okay? Just this much

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.780
I don’t want to break it, so just this much.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.500
Can everybody see this?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.680
Or just this much, the last part.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.520
All of you can see this, right?

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.280
Maybe you can't see the whole detail

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.800
but I am sure you have seen
this many times in your life.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.800
So I will give you three minutes.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.380
Close your eyes and recreate this in total detail in your mind.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.520
Start from the bottom or start from the top

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.740
and slowly create this whole thing in your mind, let me see.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.000
Okay.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.480
Are you managing?

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.580
You know being a Creator is a hard job.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.680
How much attention it must have taken

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.420
if just one piece of grass is taking so much attention?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.160
And every bit of it is unique

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.980
no repetition, no carbon copies anywhere.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.260
So what you call as creation

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.820
or the Creator

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.820
the source of creation is a phenomenal dimension of attention.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:25.280
Just from within, this body slowly got created, every cell, every detail within.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.700
Do you know how much attention it would have taken?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.760
You think it happened without attention?

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.040
Does it look like this happened without attention?

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.740
Tremendous amount of attention has gone into it, isn't it?

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.260
If that attention became conscious

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.760
then you are aware

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.940
otherwise it's only mental alertness.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.660
Mental alertness can do things.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.540
Many incredible things it can do.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.980
In the physical plane of life, mental alertness can do incredible things

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.720
it can create a world by itself.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.420
So, Tantra is a science where they started working with the mental attention to such a point

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.260
that you can create a whole new world if you wish.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.760
So Kailash is known as the Tantric mountain

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.440
and Tibet is known as the land of Tantra.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.000
It did not originate here.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.020
All the initial Gurus who came and

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.220
brought the Tantric process to Tibet were from India.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.940
So, he came and

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.100
he started the process to some extent

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.440
but he was more Buddhist than Tantric.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.640
Later on, when he realized that

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.040
it is not really taking people off their old occult practices into a spiritual process

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.160
then he went in search of a right kind of teacher who could do this

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.560
and in a completely different realm.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:20.920
There is very mystical background to the birth of Padmashambhava.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.020
He found Padmashambhava as an 8-year-old boy

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.980
who happened to be sitting on an island

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.940
which could

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.400
may not be an island as we know it.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.260
Land, water, island - not in that sense.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.080
It might have been in a completely different realm altogether.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.960
He found this boy sitting with a diamond in one hand

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.620
and a lotus in the other hand.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:58.220
So, it is from this the Vajrayana Buddhism came which is purely Tantric.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.020
It is remnants of that what you see as Tibetan Buddhism today.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.500
It is a very

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.280
what to say

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.620
it is a socially convenient concoction of mixing Buddhism and Tantrism

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.580
because Tantrism by itself would have never found acceptance in the society

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.640
because they are no-holds barred people.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.360
Buddhism is very straight and clean.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:37.260
So Padmashambhava, a clever master, he mixed these two in right proportions.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.540
Buddhism was just a camouflage. Tantra was the real thing that he brought in.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.740
So after sometime when you are not able to… generation to generation

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.120
when you are not able to keep the aliveness of the science

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.480
then the surface becomes the real thing.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.080
If…

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.440
Let's say yourself

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.940
you joined the Army, here.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.940
If you join the Army here, you will join the Chinese Army

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.200
and you wore this uniform and every day you walked up and down

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.480
or took the gun and you walked in front of us every day.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.180
Initially we will see, "Oh, this guy has become a soldier this guy has become a soldier."

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.400
After sometime, slowly, slowly you become a soldier in our mind

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.920
that person that we knew will slowly disappear.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.940
The uniform you wear becomes you

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.600
that’s what happened.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.640
These were Tantrics who wore the Buddhist uniform

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.680
because without that they wouldn’t have found social acceptance

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.420
and they did phenomenal things

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:55.020
which could have never been done with simple meditative processes of releasing

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.340
you from suffering and those kinds of things.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.020
They did phenomenal acts.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.120
And…

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.780
but from generation to generation, when the science died, the uniform remained.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.700
That’s what you see today.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.760
Still there is some flesh inside. Not totally lost

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.800
but mostly lost.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.780
And…

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:30.440
And what's being done in terms of taking life back to its works…

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.060
See, suppose you are driving a Toyota

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.360
for you a Toyota means like that, you know it looks like that.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.940
Now you have gotten the shape of the Toyota in your head.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.620
At least the back of the Toyota.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.880
Yes, because you’re constantly staring at some Toyota’s backside.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.440
It’s clear to you, that’s how a Toyota looks.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.120
This is how it looks on the road this is how it looks even

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.260
if it goes to the local garage, but if you take it to the manufacturing place a Toyota looks different.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.440
A Toyota is doing what it is doing, not because of the way you see it

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.860
because of the way somebody else sees it in the works.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.360
Yes? Do you understand what I am saying?

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.950
So, similarly a human being means he looks like this.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.800
A man means looks like this

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.800
a woman means looks like that, ant means looks like that, elephant means looks like that.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.580
That is just like seeing the backside of the Toyota.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.300
If you take it to the works

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.980
life at its works looks completely different.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.600
Yoga means taking life back into its works.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.200
In that dimension what's been done here is so phenomenal.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.000
Ironically this all started in the Indian subcontinent

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.920
and still is active in some minimal way

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.660
but mostly got wiped out

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.600
because the word Tantra

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.240
was taboo because people misunderstood it as something else.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.660
So, when, in the 12th-13th century when the

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.540
Muslim invasion came, they just slaughtered anything that is Tantra.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.400
If anybody was known to be somewhere associated with anything Tantric

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.700
he was just instantly extinguished

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.100
because these people were considered anti-God.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.560
Because God is the only creator.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.060
You can't mess with creation. That’s their idea.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.980
They left milder parts of religion

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.800
which they said, "Okay, you worship some nonsense, it's alright.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.320
But if you’re getting too deep into it, you shouldn’t live."

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.900
With that attitude they took it off.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.340
And later on when the British came

00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:00.580
with their very prudish Victorian ideas, they also stamped it out wherever they could.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.100
So very small remnants of it are left

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.960
and now the American authors

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.360
are completely destroying it by distorting it in most horrible ways.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:20.600
Because of this, this absolutely fabulous dimension of life has got derailed completely.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.440
So…

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.380
I won't go by this, but if I go by the present thought process of my mind

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.440
this is where I should come and live.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.780
Right now my thought is like that.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.520
If I give way to that, this is where I should be living

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.900
not somewhere down

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.520
because..

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.240
this is something else.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.760
It's not that we don’t have good stuff going, we have great stuff going

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.660
but this is

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.800
really freaky challenge.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.680
It's truly out of the world, not just as a statement

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.060
it's truly out of the world.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.000
Maybe this is where that expression arose

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.000
if that expression makes any sense anywhere, it's here.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.840
This is really out of the world.
