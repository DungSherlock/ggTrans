1
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,600
Dreams and impact of dreams

2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,560
have been studied

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,200
and analyzed and brutalized

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,840
and mutilated by every culture

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,120
because they're looking at it from outside.

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,640
In modern times, in 20th century,

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
modern science

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,720
has tried to analyze dreams,

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,120
and they have been the people

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,240
who've been most off the mark.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,640
Ancient societies, tribal societies

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,920
have figured some aspects of it

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,680
which are quite accurate.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
Some aspects of it

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,600
made up out of fear and hope and

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,800
in search of power and access.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,480
Distortions have happened,

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,680
but they have some sense about

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,640
these things

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,880
because they've paid attention

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,000
to their own dreams.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,960
But this idea that you can catch a dream,

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,400
is very romantic,

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,200
but is it realistically possible?

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,120
Yes, it is possible.

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,720
Not because of the willow hoop,

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
but it's possible to capture a dream.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
Few days ago, we were at Memphis

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,920
where the famous statement by 

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
Dr. Martin Luther King - 

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,800
"Yes, I have a dream".

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,600
Well, that is not

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,880
a dream that he had in his sleep.

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
It is a dream that he envisioned.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,040
It's a desire

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
that was empowered

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,560
to make it into a reality.

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,520
What is a dream, what is reality 

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,960
- the line is thin,

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,360
very thin.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,880
So one must tread this terrain

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,280
very consciously,

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,360
very carefully, because...

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,080
this has happened to me.

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm...

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm little thick in the head, you know?

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,200
I don't learn anything from anywhere,

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,200
I learn everything by experience.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,680
Well, fortunately

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
the experience has been expansive,

51
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,160
so it saved me. If it was not,

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,240
I would be in a lot of trouble.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,680
So this happens.

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,640
If you're running on a land

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,560
which has lot of either

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,760
rat holes or rabbit holes...

57
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Just now we went into such terrain.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,360
We were in Mojave Desert.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,160
These...

60
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,400
They are called prairie dogs or whatever,

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,000
small this big animals

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,600
which look like half rats half squirrels.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,760
They call them prairie dogs here.

64
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
In other parts of the world

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
with slight differences

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
they're called by different names.

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,080
In India, it's largely

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,880
rabbit holes and bandicoots making holes.

69
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,440
So if you run hard on these fields,

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,080
suddenly your leg could get trapped

71
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,280
in one of these holes.

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,720
And when you're running full speed

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
if suddenly one ankle

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,200
or one foot is held,

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,480
then you yank it so hard,

76
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,400
you will break your...

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
usually your ankle or your foot.

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,680
Well,

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,640
as by now it is a...

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,320
it is known to lot of people.

81
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,640
when I was running hard

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
trying to catch something,

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,200
one foot got stuck in the hole,

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,320
and I yanked it, and it broke.

85
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,360
I broke my left ankle

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,120
eleven times, right one nine times.

87
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,000
Still, functional.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,080
This one, see I'm saving it.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,560
Not every time I stuck it into a rabbit hole.

90
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
I did it only once.

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
Every time I broke it a different way.

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,480
Once with a rabbit hole,

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,520
once flying hang gliders,

94
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,400
maybe twice playing hockey.

95
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,920
Like this in different ways.

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,720
There are many ways to break your bones.

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,120
So  
when you walk this terrain

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
of dream

99
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,640
and consciousness,

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,000
it's a terrain with lots of holes.

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,440
You must be very nimble

102
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,160
to travel such a terrain,

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,680
otherwise your foot will get stuck

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920
in one of those

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,920
empty holes of hallucination,

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,520
and something will break.

107
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,000
This...

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,560
This warning I think

109
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,640
would be everywhere in every culture.

110
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,320
But you know,

111
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,280
warning signs are written to be ignored 

112
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
- because most human beings

113
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,160
ignore the warning signs.

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,240
I think the only culture

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,480
which has tried to tread this terrain

116
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,680
without any warning signs, thinking it's

117
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
some exotic, romantic way of doing things

118
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,400
is the European culture.

119
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,080
European psychiatry

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,040
and psychiatrists

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,760
have tried to traverse this terrain

122
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,600
without any breaks, without any warnings.

123
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,200
I think they've paid the price for that also

124
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
because they're analyzing

125
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
everything from somebody's experience.

126
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,920
They are not delving into

127
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,000
their own experience.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
They have no clue about that.

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,760
They made all the wrong conclusions, I would say.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,440
The two famous names

131
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,120
are very holy for today's societies 

132
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,080
- I can't touch them

133
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,200
but I'll just mention them

134
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,880
with namaskar 

135
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,200
 - well, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung are the big two

136
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
in this field,

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
and both of them

138
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,920
could not agree with each other.

139
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
They constantly

140
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,760
debated and fought and argued about this.

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,440
Well,

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,280
I don't want to go into that discussion

143
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,360
because

144
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
it is too off the mark.

145
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,200
See, if you tell me

146
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
your dream...

147
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,880
You can never tell me

148
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,760
your dream in its entirety

149
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,920
with all its full manifestations.

150
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,880
Why a dream?

151
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,920
You just walk down

152
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,040
the Isha lane here for five minutes

153
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,360
and tell me everything

154
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,600
that you saw exactly.

155
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,880
Unless you're so preoccupied,

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,720
you don't see a damn thing.

157
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,480
Nobody can describe what they saw in

158
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,760
five minutes

159
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,040
on the Isha lane which both sides are trees,

160
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,400
no traffic, no people,

161
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,120
no great events happening there,

162
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,680
but still you can never tell anybody

163
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,800
exactly what you saw.

164
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
So when you throw

165
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,680
a few bits of what you saw,

166
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
and I analyze that,

167
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,680
and I come to my own conclusions

168
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,480
about it,

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,640
based on that conclusions

170
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
I will make conclusions

171
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,720
about every other human being

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,240
- this is completely out of place.

173
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,120
But other ancient cultures

174
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,840
have looked at it

175
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,320
from one's own experience.

176
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,600
Some had the necessary insights,

177
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,600
some lost their way here

178
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,120
and there because, as I said,

179
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,080
the holes in the terrain are too many

180
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,120
and people get stuck

181
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,160
in those empty holes.

182
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,960
Across human history,

183
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,160
this has been studied by 

184
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,680
sages, astrologers, intellectuals

185
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,200
and suburban garden mystics.

186
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,280
Every kind of people have tried to 

187
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,200
give meaning, interpretations

188
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,960
and examine the possibilities of what

189
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,680
a dream is

190
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,840
and what it could be saying,

191
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,080
or what it could be trying to say,

192
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,600
or what it absolutely signifies.

193
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,520
Like this, different people

194
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,080
with different levels of certainty

195
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
or uncertainty have gone at it.

196
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
For most people, they are 

197
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,400
right fifty percent of the time.

198
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,960
You know, it's easy

199
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,680
to be right fifty percent of the time.

200
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
It's as easy as flipping a coin.

201
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,280
Fifty percent of the time you'll always be right.

202
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,680
I mean to say, most of the time,

203
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,680
there might have been small insights

204
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,520
but largely guesswork.

205
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,280
Many cultures

206
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,640
have seen dreams as prophetic

207
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,600
and supernatural,

208
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,520
many have seen dreams

209
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,280
as spiritual message.

210
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,040
Many have seen dreams as

211
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
God talking to them.

212
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,280
Many have used dreams

213
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,400
to drive themselves crazy, lose their

214
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,840
sanity.

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,080
Repetitive dreams of the same kind,

216
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,400
many times

217
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,960
have driven people off their sanity.

218
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
Ancient Egyptian cultures

219
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
always believed

220
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,680
dreams have a significant impact

221
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,520
on the waking reality

222
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
and dreams cure illnesses,

223
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
make important decisions.

224
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,760
Both

225
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,640
personal and political

226
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,280
decisions were made based on dreams.

227
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,920
The Egyptians also saw dream

228
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,120
as a possibility

229
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,240
to travel beyond

230
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
the physical body.

231
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,560
There are paintings which are over 5000 years old

232
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,800
which show that

233
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,960
when a person is lying down and dreaming,

234
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
the spirit, or the soul,

235
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,600
or the being is outside the body

236
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
 traveling,

237
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
or so is the interpretation.

238
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,120
These are western interpretations.

239
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,000
I will come to this later,

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,360
why this is so.

241
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,480
There is also a book

242
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,840
in the Egyptian culture called the Dream book,

243
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,600
which was written around 12000 BC 

244
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,680
during the time of Ramses.

245
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,240
In dreams, Egyptians believed...

246
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,600
The book goes about talking about

247
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
how gods demand

248
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,800
what they want,

249
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,560
what sacrifices they want from you 

250
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,600
and warn you of danger.

251
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,760
Dream is a deal time.

252
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,520
You can close the deal in the dream.

253
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
And because people saw...

254
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,800
either they saw or they claimed

255
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,280
they saw something,

256
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,640
it has happened in many cultures,

257
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,200
living people have been butchered.

258
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,760
Because in my dream, I saw

259
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,520
this Justin had two horns,

260
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
so I knew he's

261
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,920
the manifestation of devil.

262
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,080
And next day morning, I get up and say,

263
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,680
"He's the devil.

264
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,200
I saw him in my dream."

265
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,320
Well, he will be lynched or butchered.

266
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,040
This has happened

267
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,280
many, many, many times

268
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,360
in various cultures.

269
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,360
So this is why I'm saying

270
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,240
we must proceed into this terrain very, very carefully

271
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
because there are too many empty holes

272
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
where you could get stuck.

273
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,280
Even Hippocrates who is considered

274
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,480
as the father of modern medicine,

275
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,200
linked dream

276
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,240
to one's health and well-being.

277
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,720
Well, these ancient texts

278
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
and ancient dialogues,

279
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,120
how they've been translated

280
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,800
and how they've been interpreted

281
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,200
is always a questionable thing.

282
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,520
I don't like to blame the people

283
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,720
who are not here today, 

284
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,640
who are gone long time ago,

285
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,040
for the understanding or misunderstanding

286
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,520
of today's generation,

287
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,840
about what they could have done or what

288
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
they could have thought

289
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,400
or what they could have dreamed, even worse.

290
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,560
So working with dreams

291
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,040
with all kinds of misconceptions,

292
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
working with dreams with dreams

293
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
about dreams

294
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,880
is not a good idea.

295
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,640
If you want to work with dreams,

296
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,160
you should not have any dreams about dreams.

297
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,880
You must be very clear

298
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
about what it is

299
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
and how it functions within you.

300
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
By analyzing somebody else's

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
dreams, you will never know this.

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,280
You must know the mechanism

303
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,320
which makes this happen.

304
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,080
It's not about a dream.

305
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,720
It is not about a thought.

306
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,560
It is not about an emotion.

307
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,640
It's not about a life's experience.

308
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,600
It is about the mechanism

309
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,480
that creates all this.

310
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,160
Only because you're here,

311
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,040
there is a thought,

312
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,200
there is an emotion, there is a dream,

313
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,560
there is an idea,

314
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,760
there is a philosophy,

315
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,960
there are belief systems.

316
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,480
Everything is possible

317
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,880
because there is a mechanism.

318
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,840
It's about how you use it.

319
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,920
Instead of understanding

320
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
the mechanism,

321
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,560
people are trying to understand

322
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,080
the consequences. 

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
By

324
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,360
reading the footprint of a man,

325
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,880
the only thing you could know

326
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,800
is the size of his foot.

327
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,160
You will not know anything else.

328
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,480
Maybe his weight also you can assess.

329
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
You cannot even assess his height.

330
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,440
There can be somebody

331
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
very short with big feet.

332
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,600
You can probably assess his weight

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,440
depending on the imprint.

334
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,920
Beyond that, there is nothing.

335
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,200
But if you were a dog...

336
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,120
No, I'm not saying this

337
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,440
in any derogatory way.

338
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm talking about a higher grade of senses.

339
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,480
If you were a dog,

340
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,440
you know something about him,

341
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,280
you know he's our neighbor,

342
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,280
but that's about it.

343
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,280
So similarly, dreams are footprints.

344
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,280
By footprint,

345
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,600
you can know a few things.

346
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,920
Doesn't reveal the nature of the being.

347
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,280
Doesn't reveal the nature

348
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,800
of anything for that matter, gives you a

349
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,720
small scent of something.

350
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,320
Don't go after that scent

351
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,280
because you don't have

352
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,560
the sense of a dog.

353
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,720
If you go after that scent,

354
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,040
 it's an endless thing. Then 

355
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,240
one day you see that

356
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
you're not dreaming enough,

357
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,280
then you will go on a hallucinogenic

358
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,600
because you want to dream

359
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,480
endlessly, lucidly.

360
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,520
When people

361
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
are under the influence of alcohol also,

362
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,640
but more so under various hallucinogenic chemicals, 

363
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,080
people dream like crazy.

364
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,800
More real than real.

365
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,640
Means nothing.
