00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.640
So the process of knowing, process of perceiving life.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.760
Process of perceiving subtler dimensions of life.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.312
If this has to happen, one should have a vibrant physical

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:36.960
body.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.920
It's important.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.807
One's nervous system, the neurological system, should be

00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:46.800
vibrant, alive, undamaged.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.640
The chronic system should be fully active, balanced.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.008
The mind should be like a stepping stone, not a big

0e3baa67-54d3-45e4-bdcb-131c3fef39b6-1
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:04.920
barrier.

Being conscious and other things we will see later.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.283
The fundamental things is to have the right kind of body and

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:17.280
the right kind of mind and the energy and the emotion.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.070
One's nervous system is seriously impaired because of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.640
the way one lives.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.189
The kind of chemistry that you're developing within

20cff775-094c-455b-83a7-a9cf589ee854-1
00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.761
yourself moment to moment or the kind of chemistry you're

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.890
generating within yourself.

When I say the kind of chemistry today we can test and show you.

d661edc1-a96b-4eb7-a4aa-c0ad9821b5db-0
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.770
How much poison do you generate?

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.370
25 minutes of anger?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.770
5 minutes of resentment?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.450
We can actually show it to you with blood work.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.130
Nobody need to show it to you.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.756
You know by your experience, if you go through a bout of anger

663d1aad-f4cb-4352-a9df-cf09a438db00-1
00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:24.668
or resentment or fear or jealousy after that you don't

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:26.990
seem to perceive anything.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.750
You're going on with your own madness, but you cannot perceive

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.190
anything.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.854
Probably for the next few days, if you every day, every day, if

1c9a20b0-a596-4aa1-848f-729d81197a37-1
00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:39.863
you have such moments in your life, you don't perceive

1c9a20b0-a596-4aa1-848f-729d81197a37-2
00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:41.030
anything at all.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.110
And you think that's normal.

5d2e8345-9a50-4e6f-8d57-ed0dd3c090d2-0
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.030
To be Manda is normal.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.647
There is nobody here who inadvertently, unconsciously,

554f76dd-3a21-479b-897f-b4577979a4df-1
00:02:55.647 --> 00:03:03.016
has not touched the Divine in the sense in moments of extreme

554f76dd-3a21-479b-897f-b4577979a4df-2
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:08.840
love, joy, ecstasy, blissfulness, just pleasure.

ef9c542d-d6f7-4c64-91d1-c43936ba6ced-0
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.640
One might have touched it.

cf6c8f17-e1fa-407f-bf8a-2511fc47cce1-0
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.600
Only problem is, none of these things are sustainable.

093a446d-dc6e-490e-bed1-44cdccfa46cc-0
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.130
You're only touch and go, Touch and go.

1fd3357d-d542-4289-97b1-6e4c22885688-0
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.490
You can never sustain those things.

4a1e904b-f79a-44d5-b3e5-3e871240663e-0
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.970
Those are only demos.

f800604c-6531-4508-9160-c861c411d5e2-0
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.810
The real thing cannot be approached like that.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.724
And if it has to sustain, you need to have a body which can

e92a547d-4cde-4809-811b-f26c3f694001-1
00:03:38.724 --> 00:03:39.850
sustain that.

37743408-5864-4535-886c-bae2523c93fd-0
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.290
You need to have a nervous system which sustains, sustains.

f730c26f-9170-4f40-b5e9-0ac450ce9de7-0
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.091
I am separating physical body and the neurological system

f730c26f-9170-4f40-b5e9-0ac450ce9de7-1
00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:49.320
because they're two different things.

8a8de44a-41e7-45cd-bb36-36b0a62b0479-0
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.902
Literally, if you can say my body and my brain, obviously

8a8de44a-41e7-45cd-bb36-36b0a62b0479-1
00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:59.440
you're saying my body and my neurological system.

08f28847-30dd-4e92-8932-d364d1ba2236-0
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.299
Because brain is just the base for your neurological system,

08f28847-30dd-4e92-8932-d364d1ba2236-1
00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:15.278
your physical body, your neurological system, your pranic

08f28847-30dd-4e92-8932-d364d1ba2236-2
00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:15.880
body.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:29.231
And this will naturally lead to a certain chemical balance where

f4f3bb58-9167-4834-be93-a788dcf04c59-1
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:37.883
acids don't eat up your system if you right now this bunch of

f4f3bb58-9167-4834-be93-a788dcf04c59-2
00:04:37.883 --> 00:04:38.999
flowers.

c64b2885-b687-4139-b9ee-e90a0f627685-0
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.403
If you just do this, your nervous system is capable of

c64b2885-b687-4139-b9ee-e90a0f627685-1
00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:49.993
feeling how old the flowers are, how vibrant they are, how dead

c64b2885-b687-4139-b9ee-e90a0f627685-2
00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:50.780
they are.

88c19831-6663-4021-a6d8-d0677b2fa608-0
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.135
Have they come from a refrigerator or did they

88c19831-6663-4021-a6d8-d0677b2fa608-1
00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:54.940
actually come from a Jasmine plant?

b42d2e62-3dbd-48c2-9bd5-24f329bdcac2-0
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.100
All these things you will know if you simply do this.

e9dcb229-bf13-445d-9fb4-7d5a4b7ff596-0
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.260
Oh, sadhguru has yogic powers.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.380
No, don't be so silly.

bcb10b0f-4885-4885-8ef0-4af37fdb81fa-0
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.700
A bird will know it.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.780
A grasshopper knows it.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.480
Bee knows it.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.800
A cow or almost any other animal knows it.

d124350c-4ed3-4996-ad1f-2d5ea87a9357-0
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.880
They know it.

b9e31b1e-7c73-43df-ac39-7d341771018f-0
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.640
Yes or no.

87638c23-8fdd-4e3f-83e1-1dcba3982c5d-0
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.680
So it is not.

fa2994ed-5163-4ab6-8ad2-3d014b08cb4c-0
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.800
Do not consider this as some great yoga.

c95f61e2-aa72-4275-8d9e-429ccad89d3b-0
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.520
This is just normal as to how your system should be.

b064c59e-93ad-4596-8bbb-312176357a58-0
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.621
Your system can be tuned to regenerate itself with the right

b064c59e-93ad-4596-8bbb-312176357a58-1
00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:47.321
kind of food, right kind of posture, right kind of

b064c59e-93ad-4596-8bbb-312176357a58-2
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:51.836
breathing, right kind of attitude, right kind of

b064c59e-93ad-4596-8bbb-312176357a58-3
00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:56.812
thoughts, right kind of emotions, right kind of words

b064c59e-93ad-4596-8bbb-312176357a58-4
00:05:56.812 --> 00:06:02.250
that you utter and the right kind of sounds that you hear.

a9f41b37-4975-49eb-9c9b-4178bb1f51e1-0
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.972
All these things and many more can cultivate a nervous system

a9f41b37-4975-49eb-9c9b-4178bb1f51e1-1
00:06:07.972 --> 00:06:12.387
which is sensitive, which can sense life around you much

a9f41b37-4975-49eb-9c9b-4178bb1f51e1-2
00:06:12.387 --> 00:06:12.930
better.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.050
Before we address what is beyond, at least you must be

8bab1374-7b33-40f5-8c0f-53d0288fd7c7-1
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.890
able to experience the physical world in its totality.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.970
Physical world does not mean just your body.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.548
Physical world just does not mean eating, drinking,

890d5003-d6b5-4b8f-adef-a9d8195378ca-1
00:06:34.548 --> 00:06:35.290
sexuality.

4cf9e68b-40af-49aa-9a2f-fa174a47287f-0
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:45.240
No, There is enormous sensuality in just smelling the flower.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.071
In India, there is an elaborate process of sensuality for

f00a214f-8a90-430d-ae00-62d46718953c-1
00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:53.920
devotees.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.600
They are very sensual, just arranging the flowers.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.840
It's an extraordinarily sensual process.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.920
There is a devotional aspect to it.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.751
It is also very, very sensual just to arrange the flowers

5a1c9b8a-2498-4f7e-b35a-2cfaf05a0860-1
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:11.390
properly.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.390
Have you seen how some of them are doing it?

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.670
It is.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:28.828
It is a love affair, so physical in its grossest means food and

7a6c9c9e-2f6a-4c28-b5bf-c1ba8f96825b-1
00:07:28.828 --> 00:07:30.910
sexuality.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.844
It can be raised to a very subtle level where if you just

2d8375b6-00e0-4609-bc8f-75dfe1f98e05-1
00:07:36.844 --> 00:07:38.870
not, you're an ecstasis.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.626
And once you have such pleasure just sitting here, you will not

00:08:14.626 --> 00:08:16.840
indulge in this and that.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.880
This is not about right and wrong.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.120
This is not about morality.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.720
This is not about going to heaven or hell.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.422
This is about preparing your system so that it is capable of

0f0c6bdf-fb6e-49be-8265-6dd47b19d56f-1
00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:35.410
accessing dimensions of the beyond.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.570
For this you need a right kind of body.

1d88e9f1-3877-4119-b37d-1dcf2b64051c-0
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.502
If you are everyday poisoning it with wrong foods, wrong

1d88e9f1-3877-4119-b37d-1dcf2b64051c-1
00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:48.138
thoughts, wrong emotions, wrong chemistry and hope something

1d88e9f1-3877-4119-b37d-1dcf2b64051c-2
00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:49.050
will happen.

e0c019c8-ed20-4162-bd27-1a3f158ab491-0
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.050
Unfortunately life does not work like that.

6da84bd7-af99-468a-8d92-8f934a493449-0
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.592
Then the only way to make you experience anything is when you

6da84bd7-af99-468a-8d92-8f934a493449-1
00:08:59.592 --> 00:09:00.690
become disembodied.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:12.863
Yes, our ideas of well-being is always today about fixing your

00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:16.500
life the way you want it.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.197
You will see even if you successfully fix the situations,

0f221060-956d-4414-88f0-ac0f128e7b0b-1
00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:28.900
most of the time it you cannot.

8194cf37-8599-4b79-acaa-cad3834ac5df-0
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.687
But even if you successfully fix the situation, you will see the

8194cf37-8599-4b79-acaa-cad3834ac5df-1
00:09:33.687 --> 00:09:35.560
experience of life does not.

23a2a684-384a-48b2-be0c-0683572cce5a-0
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.998
Not only does not change, generally it comes down because

23a2a684-384a-48b2-be0c-0683572cce5a-1
00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:46.340
once you fix the situation, you fix the situation so that you

23a2a684-384a-48b2-be0c-0683572cce5a-2
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.840
can live unconsciously there.

44369e37-cc10-43a3-bab5-3f89ca20501c-0
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.395
You fix it the way you want it so that you can exist

44369e37-cc10-43a3-bab5-3f89ca20501c-1
00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:54.240
unconsciously.

904a2ba8-0073-4b6b-bf6f-f13be935b2fd-0
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.040
This happened to your man.

d26adcab-b00a-4ee0-be41-3f23bffa2591-0
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.140
He was caught in a robbery case where he killed somebody.

eb75fba4-76e8-4ef2-8989-5b728f853638-0
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:18.207
So he knew he is going to the electric chair, being in

eb75fba4-76e8-4ef2-8989-5b728f853638-1
00:10:18.207 --> 00:10:18.980
America.

0c03cfcc-2b4c-4d5a-a58c-42671c394524-0
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.060
Then he looked her hand.

0b0c7de5-dd7b-40a8-b9db-5a31f994c66a-0
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.460
He saw the face of a woman.

3b4ef221-4966-486b-a26d-f1b389e8151e-0
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.960
Jury had a very kind looking face.

12bc1783-0f6e-4254-bb2b-3c5fbbe34828-0
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.297
At the end of one of the hearings, he went to her and got

12bc1783-0f6e-4254-bb2b-3c5fbbe34828-1
00:10:42.297 --> 00:10:44.000
2 minutes and spoke to her.

efdf54b1-43e6-45fa-aa94-1aaec9f61cbc-0
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:54.600
Please somehow reduce my term from murder to manslaughter.

605c8c6a-9a2d-4929-812d-6b95f54cb4c6-0
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.840
I'm sorry, that's that's a legal language.

aa8f2d15-f2e9-4de3-9ef3-e363c3ea94bf-0
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.360
There's no woman slaughter, OK?

a0c98cde-0abe-464a-9ae3-78a98a048666-0
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:16.470
Because aren't you glad she was hesitating?

18423ef0-eb73-4d21-a2f4-addbc3260782-0
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.830
Then he pointed her to his lawyer.

3260b561-708f-4162-baef-2ef438e00f94-0
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.950
So the lawyer later on met her outside the court, gave her a a

3260b561-708f-4162-baef-2ef438e00f94-1
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.830
very expensive gift.

e77b790c-edac-4604-9c54-04b3b93f6e51-0
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.190
Fixed it.

44a151a2-e1c7-4b39-b8fa-378aed8704b5-0
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:39.128
Then when the final judgment came, he was given manslaughter

44a151a2-e1c7-4b39-b8fa-378aed8704b5-1
00:11:39.128 --> 00:11:40.070
15 years.

88c6aa0a-f05d-48ce-91da-334427c3cf83-0
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.550
He was very happy.

e45cf6a8-af8e-4b10-abb6-ccb35c035a83-0
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.632
After the judgment, he went to her just before they took him

e45cf6a8-af8e-4b10-abb6-ccb35c035a83-1
00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:51.630
away and he thanked her profusely.

7fbe22c9-96c8-4803-8b38-8c736645a181-0
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.096
Thank you very much for getting me manslaughter instead of

7fbe22c9-96c8-4803-8b38-8c736645a181-1
00:11:56.096 --> 00:11:56.550
murder.

61128821-e36b-440c-ae30-d5fcbc2a2084-0
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.550
How did you do it?

1e4c3467-966e-47c6-a2fc-e20466876469-0
00:11:59.390 --> 00:11:59.790
She said.

3e8505e6-3a8b-4b11-9bd0-c5b9db01875a-0
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.310
It was really difficult.

9b68ec6d-3c96-4372-ada8-f649bc2fff78-0
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.230
I somehow managed it.

425883de-7496-47be-9d74-8874baf64b54-0
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.350
All the others wanted to acquit you.

91d276e1-3a00-455c-ab4a-41ff5bce9838-0
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:19.461
So if you want to be in a state where where you internally

91d276e1-3a00-455c-ab4a-41ff5bce9838-1
00:12:19.461 --> 00:12:25.300
momentum moment every moment, absolutely your with that

91d276e1-3a00-455c-ab4a-41ff5bce9838-2
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:31.556
dimension which is the basis of everything at the same time

91d276e1-3a00-455c-ab4a-41ff5bce9838-3
00:12:31.556 --> 00:12:36.769
externally you can be as normal as normal can be.

50e89162-aa0d-4a1c-a758-366155fcb703-0
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.626
Then you need to prepare your body and your mind, your

50e89162-aa0d-4a1c-a758-366155fcb703-1
00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:45.725
chemistry, your neurological system, your energy system, all

50e89162-aa0d-4a1c-a758-366155fcb703-2
00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:48.010
these things need to be prepared.

70b08f44-1209-4f90-92b7-9761bff28b74-0
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.730
How many lifetimes will it take?

7cf22fe3-07c8-40cd-83c4-a7c4da5b591e-0
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.610
It depends how messed up you are.

e5d87a60-5884-4bc4-a4c8-b9edb6db135a-0
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:05.262
Even if you're terribly messed up, if you've constantly

e5d87a60-5884-4bc4-a4c8-b9edb6db135a-1
00:13:05.262 --> 00:13:11.323
generated wrong chemistry and it's eaten into your nervous

e5d87a60-5884-4bc4-a4c8-b9edb6db135a-2
00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:17.076
system, or you also took some outside help, put outside

e5d87a60-5884-4bc4-a4c8-b9edb6db135a-3
00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:22.110
chemicals into the system and barely damaged it.

2f4a9227-c64e-4ac1-b6bb-a453e2bc97ae-0
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:29.200
Even then, if you're willing to give it a an absolute attempt

2f4a9227-c64e-4ac1-b6bb-a453e2bc97ae-1
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.506
within this lifetime, it's possible almost for everybody

2f4a9227-c64e-4ac1-b6bb-a453e2bc97ae-2
00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:39.160
except those who are been pathologically damaged.

5e57fce9-6ff5-4181-b7de-eee7bd39e876-0
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.920
They may take more time.

d5dcb028-ac2a-46e4-9929-b72f099c8ef4-0
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.880
Others are only a question of what is the priority?

3ddfec17-4e3d-473e-b2c2-557fc5c0ca15-0
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.640
Is your investment only 21
minutes per day or 21 hours per

3ddfec17-4e3d-473e-b2c2-557fc5c0ca15-1
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.080
day?

6638727f-43c9-4bac-b9db-848baf74d3c9-0
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.710
That's a question or somewhere in between.

b089bcb9-e3d4-4a1d-b54b-d65e3a88aa5e-0
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:06.593
Depending on that, it's very much possible only because it's

b089bcb9-e3d4-4a1d-b54b-d65e3a88aa5e-1
00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:10.190
a possibility it's worth talking about.

8e476709-1abe-44ef-8de2-6aa62c7d603c-0
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.670
It's worth making an effort.

69a48cf9-5a1a-4293-af1c-da5408d221f4-0
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.479
If there was number possibility, there is no point about all

69a48cf9-5a1a-4293-af1c-da5408d221f4-1
00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:18.910
this.

d37572b2-fcfd-4d2b-9fcc-9832f9a9a2d1-0
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:28.384
So just listening to the right sounds, have you noticed when

d37572b2-fcfd-4d2b-9fcc-9832f9a9a2d1-1
00:14:28.384 --> 00:14:30.600
you had jarring sounds?

8863e524-35a7-4488-be39-cc385924fb58-0
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.742
Suppose, let's say you were exposed to a few hours of

8863e524-35a7-4488-be39-cc385924fb58-1
00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:40.676
jarring sounds of noises of automobiles or machines or

8863e524-35a7-4488-be39-cc385924fb58-2
00:14:40.676 --> 00:14:41.320
whatever.

e6fef0ea-19bf-4d2d-ad99-2801f4610f09-0
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.978
Do you notice that day If you come home, you can't perceive

e6fef0ea-19bf-4d2d-ad99-2801f4610f09-1
00:14:47.978 --> 00:14:51.120
much even about the simple things around you.

3ec9d10e-cf22-4a5e-b86f-d0b718b6484e-0
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.120
Have you noticed this?

06f19cfe-651e-4d3a-8f76-2032852a1e50-0
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.668
Another day you were just sitting at home listening to

06f19cfe-651e-4d3a-8f76-2032852a1e50-1
00:14:59.668 --> 00:15:03.896
some classical music or something, Just the breeze and

06f19cfe-651e-4d3a-8f76-2032852a1e50-2
00:15:03.896 --> 00:15:05.280
whatever that day.

1689a69d-f76a-4bf7-a445-b28a88f42001-0
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.205
Your neuro system, just bright and alert, can perceive things

1689a69d-f76a-4bf7-a445-b28a88f42001-1
00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:15.858
much more easily if you consciously take care of these

1689a69d-f76a-4bf7-a445-b28a88f42001-2
00:15:15.858 --> 00:15:17.720
things to some extent.

3a3014c8-336c-4a2b-8dc7-8bd5afb02b01-0
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:26.512
To whatever extent life allows for you, if you're an industrial

3a3014c8-336c-4a2b-8dc7-8bd5afb02b01-1
00:15:26.512 --> 00:15:34.080
worker, to do plug your ears and go if you take care of it.

a2ce658a-9c06-458b-9a65-331147618700-0
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.787
To whatever extent, at least If you're conscious that this noise

a2ce658a-9c06-458b-9a65-331147618700-1
00:15:39.787 --> 00:15:44.880
is damaging my system, this sound is nurturing my system.

70ad6736-df31-4931-a09e-0f9a69795971-0
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.120
If I utter these sounds, I notice that there is a nurture.

826d813f-baba-4223-8a50-0cc433e88d34-0
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.400
If I utter certain other sounds, I notice there is a damage.

87946483-a618-4691-b27b-dadc5d55a8b0-0
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.698
If this comes into you, you will purify the sounds that you

87946483-a618-4691-b27b-dadc5d55a8b0-1
00:15:58.698 --> 00:15:59.200
utter.

74e437b5-1e2e-414f-b6f1-fe95cda84ce5-0
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.880
Maybe you cannot stop the guy who is screaming next to you.

76237e3c-e966-45f5-b7a3-b403b67878ca-0
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.390
At least you can purify the sound that you utter, because

76237e3c-e966-45f5-b7a3-b403b67878ca-1
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.320
the maximum impact on you is the sounds that you utter.

479775a7-3c29-4bbe-9768-b2046cfee6bd-0
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.240
So the language becomes very important.

658a1b22-ea41-4625-902e-d7af3a034e0e-0
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.500
This is a clap of the master for English babies.

44d1da58-fd35-4aa3-959c-078b975384b9-0
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.620
So English language.

898ab0b3-c229-42bc-a325-e40a133e265a-0
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.580
Nothing wrong, it is just that phonetically it's not there.

eff7a33b-7623-447c-956a-fd3153acb36e-0
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:49.430
Unfortunately, all of us have become more comfortable with

eff7a33b-7623-447c-956a-fd3153acb36e-1
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:56.161
English than any other language that is historical, not by

eff7a33b-7623-447c-956a-fd3153acb36e-2
00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:56.960
choice.

a2aa41ee-331a-40c6-bcdf-688e2cda7da3-0
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.037
So the language phonetically, how it is engineered, a

a2aa41ee-331a-40c6-bcdf-688e2cda7da3-1
00:17:05.037 --> 00:17:06.800
particular language.

1ed7d83a-624c-432d-abfc-3a33ae8822e1-0
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.480
The language may be good, but still different people.

476fdd05-d6a4-4945-abd6-130ce37638c5-0
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.280
How they utter it still matters.

90b8f7b7-81fe-46aa-a4c0-3cf863d4c3dd-0
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.971
Any language can be spoken in a beneficial way to yourself or

90b8f7b7-81fe-46aa-a4c0-3cf863d4c3dd-1
00:17:21.971 --> 00:17:24.470
you can bark out a language.

e5dd1411-e275-4605-a69b-9d5e3f139333-0
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.790
Have you seen the same language?

270d2142-8554-415b-9a40-536380e21390-0
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.218
For example, the Tamil language, how we speak in Coimbatore, you

270d2142-8554-415b-9a40-536380e21390-1
00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:32.710
go to Chennai, they bark it out.

267abe85-1d31-463c-b2b9-12a580184f28-0
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:45.420
This is so in every language, certain type of people bark the

267abe85-1d31-463c-b2b9-12a580184f28-1
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.110
language.

a881201a-de21-43c2-8928-0f726df28ff5-0
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.430
Some people speak, some people sing the language.

b59c8c01-b414-4700-8f6b-d4936ff42748-0
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.990
So what type of sounds you utter are most important.

8ae3a33c-6613-4861-8546-2ffadf54e8f9-0
00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.430
This is called Vak Shuddhi.

d5062447-b4d9-42f2-a082-b6a7959050bc-0
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.846
Vak Shuddhi does not mean saying nice things, but uttering the

d5062447-b4d9-42f2-a082-b6a7959050bc-1
00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:05.750
right sounds.

589ccdbb-c946-4d6c-a5e4-5e70a0825f32-0
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.736
Whatever sound you need to utter, you utter it in a way

589ccdbb-c946-4d6c-a5e4-5e70a0825f32-1
00:18:09.736 --> 00:18:11.470
that it's beneficial for you.

f4143471-52b8-4281-bb6a-44668d68270c-0
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:17.123
And whatever is beneficial for you will naturally be beneficial

f4143471-52b8-4281-bb6a-44668d68270c-1
00:18:17.123 --> 00:18:18.910
for everybody around you.

a14d5a3c-bb78-406e-876c-93bde347b554-0
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.325
If a sound is doing wonderful things to you, it will

a14d5a3c-bb78-406e-876c-93bde347b554-1
00:18:24.325 --> 00:18:27.850
definitely do the same things to everybody around you.

0ea64983-be48-4f3b-b8ad-13f577ef1d41-0
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.090
The sound is an important part.

0db0f2e5-3953-4a61-9379-7e8fd47e0171-0
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:39.020
So is food, so is thought, so is emotion and the practice sadhana

0db0f2e5-3953-4a61-9379-7e8fd47e0171-1
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.770
to keep the energies balanced.

e651a16e-d135-45c7-84fa-c35c3536870b-0
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:48.016
If one takes care of this gradually, you will nurture a

e651a16e-d135-45c7-84fa-c35c3536870b-1
00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:53.247
body which is capable of perceiving, Oh, can I do it

e651a16e-d135-45c7-84fa-c35c3536870b-2
00:18:53.247 --> 00:18:55.320
within my family now?

47fd597d-20c9-474a-8607-877366deb2c9-0
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.840
In a family you cannot do it.

00d3b132-8381-4c45-9b9b-f3a72989edb6-0
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.680
So should I leave my family?

75767cdf-2b3d-4289-a69c-93149c01a9b0-0
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.880
If you leave it also, you cannot do it.

3adbc6a7-6e48-4501-a1ed-e63dd51e5b1c-0
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.839
These are things which you do internally, whether you live in

3adbc6a7-6e48-4501-a1ed-e63dd51e5b1c-1
00:19:09.839 --> 00:19:11.960
a forest or in a family.

402086ec-9223-4e44-9bca-93b4d778cc06-0
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720
It has nothing to do with those things.

bb7300cc-2b6e-4d89-b5f9-b0a3e99c81da-0
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.560
It is something that you do within yourself.

0c163024-a5d7-4273-af25-5e893ba3e364-0
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.690
What you do within yourself is nobody's business.

c8b261e5-2f24-4d26-99f5-c6a93365a3e4-0
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.290
Isn't it HM?

ccf059b2-8f5a-424a-b39f-f1f8af3f5d26-0
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.250
No, no.

4b9613e0-a028-43f1-970b-c16ae859c2ad-0
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.410
Some people around you will make it their business.

53f30745-2f68-407e-baed-992222189f5b-0
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.647
But even these little things, if you take home and keep it up,

53f30745-2f68-407e-baed-992222189f5b-1
00:19:42.647 --> 00:19:47.536
you will see you will become more perceptive than the way you

53f30745-2f68-407e-baed-992222189f5b-2
00:19:47.536 --> 00:19:48.640
are right now.

cb9f9dac-a9d9-488b-801b-946e21352727-0
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.314
And that's important, because if you want to experience life

cb9f9dac-a9d9-488b-801b-946e21352727-1
00:19:53.314 --> 00:19:57.255
sensitivity, the sensitivity of your perception determines

cb9f9dac-a9d9-488b-801b-946e21352727-2
00:19:57.255 --> 00:19:57.990
everything.

f9ae6c7b-8c62-490d-afd4-1f9f59627fbd-0
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:04.394
It is not something that you can get from a book or somebody's

f9ae6c7b-8c62-490d-afd4-1f9f59627fbd-1
00:20:04.394 --> 00:20:06.190
speech or something else.

9a25e849-a105-48d4-9c9c-ae60da0453a6-0
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.270
This can only be perceived.

7a4592a5-7059-4a2f-b8a2-91df09be3b27-0
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.247
Books and people can encourage you, inspire you, guide you, but

7a4592a5-7059-4a2f-b8a2-91df09be3b27-1
00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:16.230
still, unless you perceive it is not there.

7fbc02bb-3801-4211-b4a1-887320edb4be-0
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.470
Only what you perceive is reality, everything else.

46a0ff7e-8c67-4346-b321-60840bea9b2a-0
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.480
No.
