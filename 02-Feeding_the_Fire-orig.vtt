00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.600
<font color="#ffffff">In terms of life, In terms of life's experience, we can categorize the fires </font>

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.960
<font color="#ffffff">into three forms within us. </font>

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.759
<font color="#ffffff">One is known as jataragni.</font>

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:59.759
<font color="#ffffff">Jatara literally means stomach or the digestive process </font>

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.759
<font color="#ffffff">the digestive fire. </font>

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.719
<font color="#ffffff">Without a little bit of fire in your belly, you cannot digest the food that you eat because </font>

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.920
<font color="#ffffff">the food is just functioning as fuel </font>

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.000
<font color="#ffffff">and you need to break down the fuel </font>

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.200
<font color="#ffffff">to release the energy that's needed. So, there is a digestive fire going on. </font>

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.760
<font color="#ffffff">If this digestive fire is well-nourished or well supplied with fuel, </font>

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:38.599
<font color="#ffffff">it also becomes reproductive fire. So, these two dimensions of </font>

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:49.239
<font color="#ffffff">digestion and reproductive fire, together we can call them as jataragni. </font>

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:56.480
<font color="#ffffff">If your jataragni is strong, if you've maintained your jataragni well, </font>

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.040
<font color="#ffffff">you will have a robust body.</font>

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.680
<font color="#ffffff">The other dimension is called chitagni.</font>

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.919
<font color="#ffffff">In between, there are various classifications but </font>

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.560
<font color="#ffffff">I don't want to complicate your existence, I'm making it </font>

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.319
<font color="#ffffff">simple for you. One is physical, another is </font>

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.120
<font color="#ffffff">the dimension of the mind and beyond. It's called chitagni. </font>

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.520
<font color="#ffffff">If you move to the next dimension of the fire, </font>

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.120
<font color="#ffffff">which is called bhootagni – that is elemental fire</font>

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.680
<font color="#ffffff">if your elemental fire is on, you will see that </font>

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.800
<font color="#ffffff">the circus of the body and mind doesn't make much sense to you. </font>

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.400
<font color="#ffffff">Your interest and your focus will completely shift to another dimension</font>

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.919
<font color="#ffffff">of creation. More fundamental aspect of creation </font>

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:01.080
<font color="#ffffff">as to the very way life is happening rather than </font>

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:09.759
<font color="#ffffff">being entertained by the antics of the body and the mind. </font>

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:15.479
<font color="#ffffff">So, these three aspects – if one takes charge of jataragni, </font>

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:21.319
<font color="#ffffff">you have a healthy and robust body, if you take charge of your chitagni, </font>

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.479
<font color="#ffffff">you have a mind which will find </font>

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:32.159
<font color="#ffffff">many uses of course, but if you have </font>

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.719
<font color="#ffffff">mastery or some </font>

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.639
<font color="#ffffff">ability to manage your bhootagni, then you have </font>

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.840
<font color="#ffffff">fundamental mastery over life process.</font>

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.360
<font color="#ffffff">Beyond this, there is something called as sarvagni because</font>

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.039
<font color="#ffffff">the physical dimension of the existence </font>

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:08.120
<font color="#ffffff">or the physical dimension of this universe or the creation, </font>

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.159
<font color="#ffffff">as… according to modern science is less than two percent. </font>

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:21.759
<font color="#ffffff">So, if you know the entire universe, you know two percent of the existence. </font>

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:28.439
<font color="#ffffff">So, sarvagni is that dimension which touches </font>

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.720
<font color="#ffffff">where there is no elements, where there is no creation </font>

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.360
<font color="#ffffff">as you know it, or in other words, where there is no physical nature. </font>

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.759
<font color="#ffffff">Generally,</font>

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:54.160
<font color="#ffffff"> a yogi, who wants to access the nature of life, </font>

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.560
<font color="#ffffff">will not interest himself in jataragni, </font>

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.680
<font color="#ffffff">chitagni, bhootagni. </font>

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.920
<font color="#ffffff">He will focus only on sarvagni because </font>

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.079
<font color="#ffffff">this is the ultimate fire </font>

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:17.120
<font color="#ffffff">but it's a very cool fire. It does not burn like jataragni. </font>

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.800
<font color="#ffffff">It's a very obvious fire – the digestive fires. </font>

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.399
<font color="#ffffff">Chitagni is not so obvious but very much there.</font>

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:32.920
<font color="#ffffff">Bhootagni – not so visible at all but very much there. </font>

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:39.759
<font color="#ffffff">Sarvagni almost feels like it's absent but without it, nothing would happen. </font>

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.839
<font color="#ffffff">It's a fundamental fire or it's the ultimate fire </font>

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.800
<font color="#ffffff">which holds all other fires within it.</font>

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:54.759
<font color="#ffffff">In our rituals yagnas and homas, etc. we offer food </font>

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.759
<font color="#ffffff">And several other stuff into the homakund</font>

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.120
<font color="#ffffff">It is said that fire would be a medium to take on the offerings to god. </font>

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.800
<font color="#ffffff">Could you please speak about this?</font>

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.360
<font color="#ffffff">My mother even today offers some part of the cooked food to the fire</font>

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360
<font color="#ffffff">Saying that this offering is for god.</font>

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.800
<font color="#ffffff">What is happening here?</font>

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.439
<font color="#ffffff">If you are a bad cook, it's a good thing to do </font>

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.839
<font color="#ffffff">No, no, I'm not saying your mother is a bad cook but… She is </font>

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.759
<font color="#ffffff">in Andhra Pradesh, she must be good </font>

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.279
<font color="#ffffff">But if you are a bad cook, it's a good thing to do. </font>

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.560
<font color="#ffffff">Instead of putting it into this jataragni </font>

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.839
<font color="#ffffff">putting into the fire </font>

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.600
<font color="#ffffff">is safe for everybody. </font>

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.279
<font color="#ffffff">But otherwise, the idea is </font>

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.759
<font color="#ffffff">you need to understand this </font>

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:58.759
<font color="#ffffff">what you see as the current rituals are remnants of </font>

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.800
<font color="#ffffff">an elaborate science, which existed at one time. </font>

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.519
<font color="#ffffff">So, these remnants have taken on their own forms. </font>

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:14.160
<font color="#ffffff">Offering of food into the fire was an important part. </font>

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.199
<font color="#ffffff">Before… </font>

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:23.120
<font color="#ffffff">This is a part of, you know, you must see the rituals, elaborate rituals </font>

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.480
<font color="#ffffff">that… I think in that </font>

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.560
<font color="#ffffff">Kakinada region, </font>

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:40.000
<font color="#ffffff">the Hoysalas in Karnataka, the Bijjalas, </font>

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.160
<font color="#ffffff">maybe the Rajputs, maybe the Marathas also had, </font>

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.160
<font color="#ffffff">they had elaborate rituals before armies went into battle.</font>

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.480
<font color="#ffffff">All these rituals were mainly focused towards creating or</font>

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.279
<font color="#ffffff">firing up jataragni in the soldiers or the armed forces </font>

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:07.079
<font color="#ffffff">full of fire. They don't want chitagni.</font>

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:12.399
<font color="#ffffff">If a soldier thinks for himself, it's bad for the war </font>

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.639
<font color="#ffffff">He should not think. He must simply do what he is asked to do. </font>

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:24.160
<font color="#ffffff">He is full of fire here . No fire here, no fire around, just here </font>

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.560
<font color="#ffffff">So, rituals were created where jataragni is the thing.</font>

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.399
<font color="#ffffff">So before going to war, elaborate rituals </font>

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:41.559
<font color="#ffffff">to fire up the jataragni, so that individual people don't think for themselves because</font>

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:46.639
<font color="#ffffff">if all of them think, it will not go anywhere. </font>

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:51.080
<font color="#ffffff">A few people must think, others must just do. </font>

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.600
<font color="#ffffff">It's… It is coming from a certain wisdom. Today, </font>

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.279
<font color="#ffffff">our armies are trying to do the same thing by marching </font>

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:05.320
<font color="#ffffff">"Left, right, left, right, turn around, turn around, this, do this, do that."</font>

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.919
<font color="#ffffff"> Nobody knows why they're turning round and round but the thing is </font>

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:16.320
<font color="#ffffff">to beat the mind down in such a way that you don't try to reason about</font>

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.480
<font color="#ffffff">everything because when extreme conditions are there, </font>

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.879
<font color="#ffffff">if everybody thinks for themselves, it will go crazy. </font>

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:28.879
<font color="#ffffff">Somebody who knows what it is must think, others must just do. </font>

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:32.360
<font color="#ffffff">That's the way to make those situations most effective. </font>

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.039
<font color="#ffffff">So, it comes from that culture of offering food, </font>

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:44.519
<font color="#ffffff">so that the ritual was about building jataragni in a huge way. </font>

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.320
<font color="#ffffff">Maybe within the home, if you are trying to build jataragni, </font>

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:59.559
<font color="#ffffff">it could be somewhat focused towards health and well-being. </font>

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:03.559
<font color="#ffffff">If a nominal amount of food is offered, it's okay. </font>

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:07.320
<font color="#ffffff">If you are throwing half the food into it, </font>

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.159
<font color="#ffffff">you don't have much confidence in your cooking, you know </font>

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.320
<font color="#ffffff">In the Indian tradition, an aarti and doing pooja with fire is common. </font>

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.120
<font color="#ffffff">What is it that happens when one does aarti to a guru, </font>

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.919
<font color="#ffffff">a photo of a god or an idol or on the Ganga,</font>

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:36.600
<font color="#ffffff">and then people take the aarti to apply it to their face. </font>

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.879
<font color="#ffffff">Does something change in the fire after the aarti?</font>

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:57.080
<font color="#ffffff">It is not that the fire changes. As we already said, what you're talking is the reverse </font>

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.399
<font color="#ffffff">engineering of what I already spoke, in the sense – if… </font>

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:06.919
<font color="#ffffff">if a certain form is exuding certain energy </font>

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:10.840
<font color="#ffffff">and you do not know or you do not have the capability </font>

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.639
<font color="#ffffff">to simply connect with it and you want to connect with it, </font>

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:19.360
<font color="#ffffff">fire is a good medium to bring both of you together.</font>

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.919
<font color="#ffffff">As we have been Saying fire has been used in so many ways to bond with each other. </font>

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:33.879
<font color="#ffffff">Without fire, there is no wedding in India because it is being used as a bond </font>

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:37.360
<font color="#ffffff">to bring people together. </font>

00:11:56.639 --> 00:12:03.759
<font color="#ffffff">And whether the fire is… extra fire is being used or </font>

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:08.120
<font color="#ffffff">people's jataragni in the form of their passions</font>

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:14.000
<font color="#ffffff">is burning through and coming together, whichever way, without fire there is no union </font>

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
<font color="#ffffff">of any kind. </font>

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.600
<font color="#ffffff">Whether physical kind, emotional kind or spiritual kind,</font>

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.600
<font color="#ffffff">without fire there is no union. Taking this further, if a certain form </font>

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.720
<font color="#ffffff">either in the form of a picture or a deity, </font>

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.600
<font color="#ffffff">if it is exuding certain energy, </font>

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.679
<font color="#ffffff">to make yourself available to it, </font>

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:41.960
<font color="#ffffff">fire is a good means.</font>

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:48.879
<font color="#ffffff">So you will see, enter the Devi temple, if a few people go stand there – fire, </font>

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:51.159
<font color="#ffffff">so that they will connect. </font>

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.399
<font color="#ffffff">It's not that she will not connect without fire, she will. </font>

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:21.480
<font color="#ffffff">But to make you conducive to it, to make you available to it, </font>

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.879
<font color="#ffffff">to make it the way where… </font>

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:32.919
<font color="#ffffff">If… See, if you're looking at in a elemental way, </font>

00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:37.600
<font color="#ffffff">you cannot connect with whatever the earth and water </font>

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.720
<font color="#ffffff">that is there in somebody or something.</font>

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.600
<font color="#ffffff">But if fire is built between people, something gets connected. </font>

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.600
<font color="#ffffff">So, this entire process is to connect you </font>

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.919
<font color="#ffffff">with that dimension. So, the fire which goes around the deity </font>

00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:00.159
<font color="#ffffff">has acquired that. The aura of the fire, not the fire itself, </font>

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:03.240
<font color="#ffffff">the akash around the fire</font>

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.159
<font color="#ffffff">has acquired a quality of the divine. So, </font>

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:11.039
<font color="#ffffff">when it comes to you, you don't put your hand into the fire, around that </font>

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:14.600
<font color="#ffffff">you take the akash and put it to your eyes</font>

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.840
<font color="#ffffff">or put it on top your head or put it to your heart.</font>

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:24.120
<font color="#ffffff">You want to take the akash and you want to benefit from that. </font>

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:32.840
<font color="#ffffff">You are trying to take some element of the divine </font>

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.240
<font color="#ffffff">for your own benefit to take it and make it a part of yourself.</font>

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.919
<font color="#ffffff">So, the whole aarti process is an effort in this direction. </font>

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:45.480
<font color="#ffffff">It is… </font>

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.080
<font color="#ffffff">These are all different things that can assist a person </font>

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:55.320
<font color="#ffffff">to slowly develop your own fire. But above all, in the yogic system, </font>

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.240
<font color="#ffffff">there are various processes where no fire is lit, </font>

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.120
