00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.600
In terms of life, In terms of life's experience, we can categorize the fires 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.960
into three forms within us. 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.759
One is known as jataragni.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:59.759
Jatara literally means stomach or the digestive process 

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.759
the digestive fire. 

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.719
Without a little bit of fire in your belly, you cannot digest the food that you eat because 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.920
the food is just functioning as fuel 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.000
and you need to break down the fuel 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.200
to release the energy that's needed. So, there is a digestive fire going on. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.760
If this digestive fire is well-nourished or well supplied with fuel, 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:38.599
it also becomes reproductive fire. So, these two dimensions of 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:49.239
digestion and reproductive fire, together we can call them as jataragni. 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:56.480
If your jataragni is strong, if you've maintained your jataragni well, 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.040
you will have a robust body.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.680
The other dimension is called chitagni.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.919
In between, there are various classifications but 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.560
I don't want to complicate your existence, I'm making it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.319
simple for you. One is physical, another is 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.120
the dimension of the mind and beyond. It's called chitagni. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.520
If you move to the next dimension of the fire, 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.120
which is called bhootagni – that is elemental fire

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.680
if your elemental fire is on, you will see that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.800
the circus of the body and mind doesn't make much sense to you. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.400
Your interest and your focus will completely shift to another dimension

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.919
of creation. More fundamental aspect of creation 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:01.080
as to the very way life is happening rather than 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:09.759
being entertained by the antics of the body and the mind. 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:15.479
So, these three aspects – if one takes charge of jataragni, 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:21.319
you have a healthy and robust body, if you take charge of your chitagni, 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.479
you have a mind which will find 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:32.159
many uses of course, but if you have 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.719
mastery or some 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.639
ability to manage your bhootagni, then you have 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.840
fundamental mastery over life process.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.360
Beyond this, there is something called as sarvagni because

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.039
the physical dimension of the existence 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:08.120
or the physical dimension of this universe or the creation, 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.159
as… according to modern science is less than two percent. 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:21.759
So, if you know the entire universe, you know two percent of the existence. 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:28.439
So, sarvagni is that dimension which touches 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.720
where there is no elements, where there is no creation 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.360
as you know it, or in other words, where there is no physical nature. 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.759
Generally,

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:54.160
 a yogi, who wants to access the nature of life, 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.560
will not interest himself in jataragni, 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.680
chitagni, bhootagni. 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.920
He will focus only on sarvagni because 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.079
this is the ultimate fire 

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:17.120
but it's a very cool fire. It does not burn like jataragni. 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.800
It's a very obvious fire – the digestive fires. 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.399
Chitagni is not so obvious but very much there.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:32.920
Bhootagni – not so visible at all but very much there. 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:39.759
Sarvagni almost feels like it's absent but without it, nothing would happen. 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.839
It's a fundamental fire or it's the ultimate fire 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.800
which holds all other fires within it.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:54.759
In our rituals yagnas and homas, etc. we offer food 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.759
And several other stuff into the homakund

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.120
It is said that fire would be a medium to take on the offerings to god. 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.800
Could you please speak about this?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.360
My mother even today offers some part of the cooked food to the fire

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360
Saying that this offering is for god.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.800
What is happening here?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.439
If you are a bad cook, it's a good thing to do 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.839
No, no, I'm not saying your mother is a bad cook but… She is 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.759
in Andhra Pradesh, she must be good 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.279
But if you are a bad cook, it's a good thing to do. 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.560
Instead of putting it into this jataragni 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.839
putting into the fire 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.600
is safe for everybody. 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.279
But otherwise, the idea is 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.759
you need to understand this 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:58.759
what you see as the current rituals are remnants of 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.800
an elaborate science, which existed at one time. 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.519
So, these remnants have taken on their own forms. 

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:14.160
Offering of food into the fire was an important part. 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.199
Before… 

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:23.120
This is a part of, you know, you must see the rituals, elaborate rituals 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.480
that… I think in that 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.560
Kakinada region, 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:40.000
the Hoysalas in Karnataka, the Bijjalas, 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.160
maybe the Rajputs, maybe the Marathas also had, 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.160
they had elaborate rituals before armies went into battle.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.480
All these rituals were mainly focused towards creating or

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.279
firing up jataragni in the soldiers or the armed forces 

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:07.079
full of fire. They don't want chitagni.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:12.399
If a soldier thinks for himself, it's bad for the war 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.639
He should not think. He must simply do what he is asked to do. 

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:24.160
He is full of fire here . No fire here, no fire around, just here 

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.560
So, rituals were created where jataragni is the thing.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.399
So before going to war, elaborate rituals 

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:41.559
to fire up the jataragni, so that individual people don't think for themselves because

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:46.639
if all of them think, it will not go anywhere. 

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:51.080
A few people must think, others must just do. 

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.600
It's… It is coming from a certain wisdom. Today, 

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.279
our armies are trying to do the same thing by marching 

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:05.320
"Left, right, left, right, turn around, turn around, this, do this, do that."

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.919
 Nobody knows why they're turning round and round but the thing is 

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:16.320
to beat the mind down in such a way that you don't try to reason about

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.480
everything because when extreme conditions are there, 

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.879
if everybody thinks for themselves, it will go crazy. 

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:28.879
Somebody who knows what it is must think, others must just do. 

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:32.360
That's the way to make those situations most effective. 

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.039
So, it comes from that culture of offering food, 

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:44.519
so that the ritual was about building jataragni in a huge way. 

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.320
Maybe within the home, if you are trying to build jataragni, 

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:59.559
it could be somewhat focused towards health and well-being. 

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:03.559
If a nominal amount of food is offered, it's okay. 

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:07.320
If you are throwing half the food into it, 

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.159
you don't have much confidence in your cooking, you know 

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.320
In the Indian tradition, an aarti and doing pooja with fire is common. 

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.120
What is it that happens when one does aarti to a guru, 

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.919
a photo of a god or an idol or on the Ganga,

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:36.600
and then people take the aarti to apply it to their face. 

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.879
Does something change in the fire after the aarti?

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:57.080
It is not that the fire changes. As we already said, what you're talking is the reverse 

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.399
engineering of what I already spoke, in the sense – if… 

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:06.919
if a certain form is exuding certain energy 

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:10.840
and you do not know or you do not have the capability 

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.639
to simply connect with it and you want to connect with it, 

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:19.360
fire is a good medium to bring both of you together.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.919
As we have been Saying fire has been used in so many ways to bond with each other. 

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:33.879
Without fire, there is no wedding in India because it is being used as a bond 

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:37.360
to bring people together. 

00:11:56.639 --> 00:12:03.759
And whether the fire is… extra fire is being used or 

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:08.120
people's jataragni in the form of their passions

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:14.000
is burning through and coming together, whichever way, without fire there is no union 

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
of any kind. 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.600
Whether physical kind, emotional kind or spiritual kind,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.600
without fire there is no union. Taking this further, if a certain form 

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.720
either in the form of a picture or a deity, 

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.600
if it is exuding certain energy, 

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.679
to make yourself available to it, 

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:41.960
fire is a good means.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:48.879
So you will see, enter the Devi temple, if a few people go stand there – fire, 

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:51.159
so that they will connect. 

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.399
It's not that she will not connect without fire, she will. 

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:21.480
But to make you conducive to it, to make you available to it, 

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.879
to make it the way where… 

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:32.919
If… See, if you're looking at in a elemental way, 

00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:37.600
you cannot connect with whatever the earth and water 

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.720
that is there in somebody or something.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.600
But if fire is built between people, something gets connected. 

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.600
So, this entire process is to connect you 

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.919
with that dimension. So, the fire which goes around the deity 

00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:00.159
has acquired that. The aura of the fire, not the fire itself, 

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:03.240
the akash around the fire

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.159
has acquired a quality of the divine. So, 

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:11.039
when it comes to you, you don't put your hand into the fire, around that 

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:14.600
you take the akash and put it to your eyes

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.840
or put it on top your head or put it to your heart.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:24.120
You want to take the akash and you want to benefit from that. 

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:32.840
You are trying to take some element of the divine 

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.240
for your own benefit to take it and make it a part of yourself.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.919
So, the whole aarti process is an effort in this direction. 

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:45.480
It is… 

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.080
These are all different things that can assist a person 

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:55.320
to slowly develop your own fire. But above all, in the yogic system, 

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.240
there are various processes where no fire is lit, 

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.120
all the fires lit are within. 

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.039
So, this is what you hear from ancient times, the yogis were doing tapas. 

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:11.360
The word tapa means heat or fire. 

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.600
So, you are generating your own fire. What kind of fire? Do you want jataragni, 

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.799
do you want chitagni, do you want bhootagni or do you want sarvagni? 

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:26.000
Accordingly, there are different types of sadhanas for one to do, so that 

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.799
one can benefit from that. 

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:29.720
So, external help 

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.399
is needed when internal 

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.840
possibilities are not so big. 

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.799
But internal possibilities, if they are created, 

00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:42.639
no external help is needed. That's a simple aspect of it.
