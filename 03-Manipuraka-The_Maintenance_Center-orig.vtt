00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:26.399
Manipuraka is in a way a consequence of swadhishthana and muladhara. 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:33.399
This is a maintenance center. What is fundamental to the body, what is regenerative, 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.439
these two things together generate life.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:41.159
Manipura just maintains. 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:48.920
This is important because whatever you create, if you don't maintain, it'll be gone. 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.280
A garden, however beautiful it may look, if it's not maintained 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.280
for a month, it will no more be a garden, it'll be gone. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.120
So maintaining this is very, very important. In that sense, manipura is important. 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.560
People can move their manipura, in the sense… All of them can be moved 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.120
but particularly with manipura, there is more mobility 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.079
because this is the only place, where all the 72,000 nadis 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.400
meet and redistribute themselves. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.359
Because of that, one can move their manipura in many different ways.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.840
Those of you who are on martial arts, 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.120
one important aspect is to be able to move the manipura. 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.200
If you have to move the manipura, your martial art has to come to a place, 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.359
where it goes from movement to stillness. 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:50.000
To bring this stillness into the system is all the movement. All the movement, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.319
violent and difficult movements of martial art is to come to a place, 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.599
where you can be without any movement. 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.599
When stillness comes, then your ability to move

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.039
the manipura becomes enormously enhanced. In some of the movies 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.319
and other things, you must have seen these Far Eastern movies, they're showing you, 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.719
one old man is sitting there, hooh if he do, everybody 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.680
just falls down just like that 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.280
no, I'm not talking about the Rajnikanth movies 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.919
there, more things happen, that's a different matter 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:37.400
because your ability to move the manipura gives you a different kind of power. And 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.120
one thing that is done with 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.680
Far Eastern martial art styles is 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.639
continuously knocking the manipura in so many ways. 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.840
Every day, hundreds of punches are taken in the stomach 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.680
to strengthen this in such a way that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.159
it is very stable, but because it's so stable, you can move it where you want. 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.520
If you move your maintenance center away from the navel, 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.599
then you have a certain capacity that the body's ability to last, 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.680
body's ability to take injury, body's ability to take beating 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.080
is greatly, greatly enhanced because 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.039
you have moved the manipura away from the navel center and 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.560
it gives a phenomenal capability to move your energy. But 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.879
once you use manipura, once you move manipura from its naturals 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.879
location, then it's very important you keep your body still, otherwise

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.159
you will not last long. Anybody who does that 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.159
will never live long, they won't cross thirty-five, thirty-six years of age. 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.360
Because once you move manipura, it is important that you 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.039
learn to keep your body very, very still. 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:59.919
If any movement happens at that time, then the entire maintenance center 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.879
will go into a disarray. 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.840
Once the maintenance center goes into disarray, you will die in strange ways. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.479
Nobody can diagnose what's happening with you. 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:15.280
You will simply die of something strange happening, which has no reason, 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.399
no logical reason as to why it's happening in normal sense.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.680
So one of the things that 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.800
people who're on the manipura sadhana will do 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.279
not the martial arts people, they are looking at physical prowess 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:36.800
on the spiritual path, one of the things that we do is to bring sound to manipura. 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.120
Because if you bring any sound to manipura , it spreads right across the body 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.560
and the body will reverberate with this sound. 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.120
Now let's say you want sound "Shiva", "Shambho" to become part of your system, 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.319
then you do manipura sadhana with the sound, so that it spreads 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:00.800
to every part of the body and now the very body reverberates like that.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:18.600
This happened. Palani Swami was referred to as Palani Swami because

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.319
he never told anybody what's his name – maybe even he didn't remember. 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:33.360
Because people saw him in many fantastic states around the Palani hills, 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.639
people referred to him as Palani Swami. One of the things that happened in his life was… 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.680
Because he was... without doing anything, just by sitting in 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.519
one place, he was drawing such crowds, 

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:54.519
the temple priests were little resentful. This man who does nothing, 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:59.439
who begs his food from other people, is drawing so many people. 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.120
They're sitting in the temple morning to evening, doing their rituals and duties. 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.360
But people are not coming that way, they're going this way. 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.279
So, they wanted to find something, some rankle out there.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:20.439
So one day, Palani Swami was accused that he's taking god's name when 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:27.519
he's doing his morning ablutions, which is considered not right. 

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:35.360
When you are at shit, you should not say "Shiva", that's the whole thing, to put it simply. 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.839
So he was brought before

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:50.040
the village panchayat and accused 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.319
that he's desecrating god by uttering 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:03.800
"Shambho" when he's out there to relieve himself in the morning.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:11.680
They brought him in front of this ignorant bunch of judges. 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.439
He simply sat there, eyes closed, mouth closed. 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:26.600
A loud reverberation of sound "Shambho" went on. 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.439
That was the end of their prosecution. And he got too much 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:40.879
attention, so he left that place.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:45.439
He didn't want that much attention, so he left that place because 

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:48.959
after this too much attention started coming. People started 

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:53.680
gathering in big numbers, so he moved away from there.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.800
So this, if you move a sound to your manipura, 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.079
now this will spread right across the system 

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:10.240
and the very body will reverberate this sound. 

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.399
If you utter it with... in your mouth, it is called japa.

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:19.240
If you utter it with your heart, it's called tapa.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.360
If you bring it to your manipura, it's called ajapa. That means, 

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.319
without doing japa, the sound is enemating from you. Without 

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:34.639
Without opening your mouth, without using your vocal cord, 

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:39.440
without using the air passages for which are needed to utter a sound, 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.879
the very body reverberates the sound.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:53.720
These three chakras, manipura, muladhara, swadhishthana and manipuraka 

00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:00.200
constitute in many ways the physical dimension of the body. 

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.279
The other four of are of a different nature. These three are most essential. 

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:10.080
Whether one wants to live physically well, 

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.720
mentally well, emotionally well, or energetically well 

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.039
or to enhance one's capabilities of living on this planet, 

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:26.799
these three are most important and entire schools of yoga 

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:32.240
appeared in permutations and combinations of these three. The others 

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.879
have a different significance and consequence.
