00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.440
Namaskaram Sadhguru.

690f6cff-7f05-4e96-aecc-eaae6d7e002c-0
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.200
I feel like I'm in a limbo between illusion and truth.

dcfd009f-7a07-4df4-a600-c00b86edfce3-0
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.182
How do I know if I'm going forward towards truth or falling

dcfd009f-7a07-4df4-a600-c00b86edfce3-1
00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:27.760
back into the illusion that I always thought was real?

15428935-fa3a-445e-a320-0a21ccd09e9d-0
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:48.791
Now the most important thing about spirituality is you work

15428935-fa3a-445e-a320-0a21ccd09e9d-1
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:59.404
incessantly with such intensity, like you're out to get

15428935-fa3a-445e-a320-0a21ccd09e9d-2
00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:01.300
somewhere.

a2fac0ad-7d60-4099-853c-2ba743805fa9-0
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.200
Your intensity and the way you apply yourself.

394833bc-bfb9-458b-8172-6ea31a8fc255-0
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.598
Anybody who sees you, they should be thinking you're really

394833bc-bfb9-458b-8172-6ea31a8fc255-1
00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:18.812
a busy man wanting to get somewhere, but you don't really

394833bc-bfb9-458b-8172-6ea31a8fc255-2
00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.120
care where you go.

68004746-1bcc-42d2-be68-bbeed89ceaec-0
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.080
This is the most basic quality.

27fc3bc7-56bb-4317-bac5-c5b01a9e3b16-0
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.207
Just maintaining the intensity, just maintaining the necessary

27fc3bc7-56bb-4317-bac5-c5b01a9e3b16-1
00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:32.920
awareness.

4a78fe45-f37f-4b80-9661-ddc6b2023623-0
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.560
Where you have to go will happen.

a32d0652-c746-4e52-a57f-f96d197cf3d2-0
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.160
How can you choose where to go?

463ce33c-9792-4768-8f79-88b9b8554a31-0
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.160
If you choose where to go?

adc5b7c8-8070-4534-975f-981a4e7c7e12-0
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.280
You are not a seeker.

130147a4-0435-470b-b7bb-1669aaa09785-0
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.240
You already concluded you want to go to heaven, isn't it?

7925ef36-063c-49c1-83f0-15a8030b7755-0
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.760
Heaven may be a horrible place.

4bc4ad5c-6a20-4c5a-bc48-83275daaa01c-0
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.360
How do you know?

1e4f7826-300d-4139-87cd-bb78f790c201-0
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.668
Because your religions have always been telling you gods

1e4f7826-300d-4139-87cd-bb78f790c201-1
00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:57.760
have been visiting the planet too often.

8290f28b-a033-43e2-ac34-8e08449674e8-0
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.760
It must be a bad place.

daaefba0-89df-4517-9224-bd195d1c651e-0
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.560
They take it that they want to take a holiday and planet Earth.

be717b1b-45e6-4247-a8bf-e9a8c9d5db36-0
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.600
So why do you fix your destination?

f3b12f9c-9414-4597-ab39-8260b1530584-0
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.880
When you say I'm a seeker, that means you're genuinely seeking.

48cc6b7a-fe17-43bb-acb4-c1520ed340cc-0
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.360
You don't know what's the other end.

c2a29071-58d7-404b-80ae-dd8bc905e80f-0
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.160
No, no, no, God.

aecf7944-4a0b-4f62-8ade-53a2995e0a44-0
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.560
It doesn't matter whether the other end is God or Devil.

1e88c0c4-75cd-4632-bdb6-ad925dbd088f-0
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.560
Your thing is you want to seek as to what is true.

b39f4b2f-9ef5-418a-a97f-7dccfa34b52f-0
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.160
That's all.

559297de-7a97-47f1-9a98-b60fd088bcb1-0
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.640
That's what a seeker means.

f10f82aa-a0e9-4290-8e14-0e852c3d4c84-0
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.640
The other end may not be light.

30b89aac-a050-440d-9c5d-61e5bdde32fa-0
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040
The other end may be absolute darkness.

53c652aa-8fa6-4c90-96c3-7f06762d9654-0
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.840
The other end may not be God.

90253db8-5e94-45b2-a172-ce057967e6d8-0
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.640
It may be just the Devil himself.

b8e3768b-5f32-4314-b862-eebabe19f452-0
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.000
But that's not the point.

ec7d0e71-f834-402e-86a5-a9bc5b76e63c-0
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.752
A seeker means he's seeking whatever it is true he's

ec7d0e71-f834-402e-86a5-a9bc5b76e63c-1
00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:48.240
seeking.

1122e60d-f4e6-492d-98fe-17d1ea3c38ed-0
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760
He's not made a conclusion as to what he should get in the end.

03a4cde0-038d-42c7-ba24-ee799616d105-0
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.682
He's simply seeking the moment you make a conclusion as to what

03a4cde0-038d-42c7-ba24-ee799616d105-1
00:02:58.682 --> 00:03:03.634
should be at the other end, you're no more a seeker, you're

03a4cde0-038d-42c7-ba24-ee799616d105-2
00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.120
a vested interest.

9b03d8a0-1484-45f5-ab3e-2f70c45064fb-0
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.060
It is just that you're still working for the agents of your

9b03d8a0-1484-45f5-ab3e-2f70c45064fb-1
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.120
religion in a devious way.

2db14e21-11d6-4f85-a35b-8c9dc65ab38e-0
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.440
You want to find God at the end?

8e47b682-546b-4cb8-a16d-54b5985cd894-0
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.760
Then you're still the agent of your religion.

8cc00a65-a1b1-4a8a-abc7-0b74e2028874-0
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.120
Which of religion you come from?

c616e82a-2e69-43b7-b8fa-b3ee5c31682a-0
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.600
Because what kind of God do you expect?

12203aac-aa91-45bd-9d1f-aa105fbd761a-0
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.720
As culturally you've been trained.

b9a2d861-c35c-48b0-99f2-d9378d265845-0
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.400
That's the kind of God you will expect.

75fb9b69-c1d7-40c3-8244-c56f76025d71-0
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.160
If another kind of God comes, you won't like him.

6753c9b3-58ef-4548-8f38-d0116d26cbe0-0
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.480
You come from a culture where God must be a old man.

25f2a3b8-c966-4b8d-b166-8355afdcb4de-0
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.520
You cannot accept any young man as God.

70aa123c-ab9c-42f1-8414-e1cdfc91794f-0
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.480
He must be white, bearded, long, robed.

d050753d-8195-4d9d-84c6-12866b206dd5-0
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.173
If you are from India, he must have minimum four hands, two

d050753d-8195-4d9d-84c6-12866b206dd5-1
00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:53.880
hand guard.

d0528562-0670-4bdc-8604-966f879ea1e3-0
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.436
We will not accept, We are not going to accept two hand guards,

d0528562-0670-4bdc-8604-966f879ea1e3-1
00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:01.640
at least two extra hands he needs, isn't it?

507a98fe-3737-4266-9bee-9038dc5bd5af-0
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.880
Otherwise, what can he do better than me?

8b010d90-ddab-4134-be78-10e68d879854-0
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.680
That much sense we got.

ffbde96a-6d2a-4d29-9bf5-06234d2e0115-0
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:22.623
So if you are aware that you have been in an illusion, that's

ffbde96a-6d2a-4d29-9bf5-06234d2e0115-1
00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:23.680
good.

c2cf14c7-f71a-4078-a1cb-52e8c46bd5f7-0
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.625
But if you become aware you're still in another illusion,

c2cf14c7-f71a-4078-a1cb-52e8c46bd5f7-1
00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:30.520
that's better.

7df92be2-cd1a-4803-84ba-d4cc97213bcf-0
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.320
If illusions have to go, you must stop creating, isn't it?

a675f0d7-9d15-4356-bfce-cb21ade889c8-0
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.640
You must stop creating.

3ecd18bf-d72a-426e-beb6-cbc0bef7e52d-0
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.000
Gods, devils, heavens, Hells, everything.

73eb622d-1396-4992-bd36-f7a5a7c6f042-0
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.320
If you stop creating you move from illusion to reality.

b43316e7-08fa-41fb-98c2-6b2ad68d90b8-0
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.971
If you start creating will go deeper and deeper into

b43316e7-08fa-41fb-98c2-6b2ad68d90b8-1
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.600
illusions.

2f696091-164a-409d-9234-8eda1c87c2c9-0
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.560
So stop creating as to what is reality.

c768a029-34b2-4657-bc2b-a6c2b31e0738-0
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.340
You don't know what's reality, just make yourself more and more

c768a029-34b2-4657-bc2b-a6c2b31e0738-1
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.800
aware.

9c3cc609-ac59-4afd-851e-7f7d2194eeef-0
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.280
Become more and more steady on your awareness.

069fa54f-a1c3-4f77-b17e-f6651c27f7ed-0
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.470
Just bring little more quietness into you so that you can feel

069fa54f-a1c3-4f77-b17e-f6651c27f7ed-1
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.280
life little deeper than you.

0811d720-138c-4b77-998f-d6ac8065b34d-0
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.320
Don't try to feel the sky.

e594d51f-07db-4d8b-b262-6541bb4c2099-0
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.840
Don't try to feel something else.

afebe370-8e6b-416f-9cb2-dd032766c40f-0
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.720
No, it's dropping inside you.

61bc23e8-fb18-4afd-bf40-ad68640ebca2-0
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.280
This is the easiest place to feel it.

c4d90686-660f-440f-a886-d8a2b6d15411-0
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.640
The moment you look up at the sky, imagination will fly.

7aa65995-0431-4400-9464-048d45318669-0
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.600
The moment you think about God, imagination will fly.

7ea43738-480b-47ea-baf1-c9b4b1f10d39-0
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.086
The moment you talk about heaven's imaginations will fly

7ea43738-480b-47ea-baf1-c9b4b1f10d39-1
00:05:51.086 --> 00:05:51.480
here.

86dfcc6a-9f1c-4620-801a-299879569095-0
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.800
It's throbbing inside you.

58ba79fd-762b-4e0d-85a1-317bee58c381-0
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.800
Life, Life in its most essential form, is happening within you.

31b1af66-f602-485e-aea5-541469c2425f-0
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.648
Anything you want to know about it, any truth that you want to

31b1af66-f602-485e-aea5-541469c2425f-1
00:06:03.648 --> 00:06:07.084
discover about life, you must look here, because it's

31b1af66-f602-485e-aea5-541469c2425f-2
00:06:07.084 --> 00:06:09.120
happening right here within you.

9e733885-2362-4595-918a-b09474dd92e8-0
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.797
If you look somewhere else, definitely you will go into more

9e733885-2362-4595-918a-b09474dd92e8-1
00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:15.880
and more illusions.

c9f61f6c-dad7-47ab-ba31-7e5554d5610a-0
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.657
So don't try to fight your illusions, because if you fight

c9f61f6c-dad7-47ab-ba31-7e5554d5610a-1
00:06:22.657 --> 00:06:26.440
with your illusion, you must be a real fool, isn't it?

6b5722fb-65c5-49d5-8e84-c082e8d0d2b6-0
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.720
When you know it's an illusion, what is there to fight with?

b80c0705-0325-4628-acf2-65447921460a-0
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.415
If you're aware that something is an illusion, why do you go

b80c0705-0325-4628-acf2-65447921460a-1
00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:37.160
and fight it?

dd16c7be-ec85-4ee7-8b97-ff820af38b89-0
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.040
Only because you think it's reality.

ce42f50d-8733-4a73-a95f-2a67caf3214d-0
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.120
You fight it, isn't it?

0a1dd4a8-388c-490e-9029-cfacdf914325-0
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.539
If you see, or if you're aware this is illusion, it just falls

0a1dd4a8-388c-490e-9029-cfacdf914325-1
00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:48.960
aside.

a763edea-f282-4ad7-8cc2-c1a8fc19e405-0
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.080
It simply falls there.

3a75b014-cc06-452a-bc0b-b07fb272fa16-0
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.240
It's got nothing to do with you.

69bd7cf8-016f-4582-a38a-c8a1ab6751b0-0
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.966
So if you're genuinely A seeker of truth, you don't worry about

69bd7cf8-016f-4582-a38a-c8a1ab6751b0-1
00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:02.880
illusions.

fe43e507-f9bf-4599-af95-56d495827374-0
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.360
You don't worry about reality.

15e58901-a2ae-4231-8c60-680a2e3968a7-0
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.760
You don't try to split hair.

36e279b0-55e5-4d11-ba5c-f5de66633198-0
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.560
You just move into higher and higher levels of awareness.

e83bb6e7-81a4-463f-9059-c4783018b121-0
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.520
What you see, you see.

6e87e758-f8f0-43d8-821f-b95957824346-0
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.920
What?

0da04307-f389-4977-b31b-fb2126d3a570-0
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.440
You don't see, You don't see.

b251bd95-d869-4418-a0bc-5bd3a5ed6536-0
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.840
Never say.

d4144a80-75fc-4a4d-9732-3d57f669a4b8-0
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.400
This is it.

e6cbeade-cd4f-4c8a-9a51-4c9a09891920-0
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.040
That's all.

197a414c-536d-401b-ac09-80523988b4af-0
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.720
Don't say this is it.

0db91d13-5551-40f9-b268-40a998bb03ca-0
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.244
Give that privilege to me that someday I can tell you this is

0db91d13-5551-40f9-b268-40a998bb03ca-1
00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:26.400
it.

955eeb9c-d79b-4280-b85d-00390248e3a0-0
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.560
I want to say that to somebody.

a132be78-cb2f-440a-8b44-0c3f2c8abc29-0
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.240
I'm waiting.

771660a3-1c47-42e1-9fd6-27053d582e29-0
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.080
So you don't say.

673e90b8-87a1-4e56-ae69-387a11702c4c-0
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.760
This is it.

cbf6078c-8f47-4a2a-9e4e-185cece8563f-0
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.680
You constantly heighten your awareness.

7396ce84-7cfd-4814-8212-1443566a2ced-0
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.080
Whatever you see, you see.

71e1c5ce-1538-4aaf-99be-450bbde2d7b0-0
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.800
That's all.

89c8021a-db4f-4876-a7e1-b5e68e6f944b-0
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.480
Whatever you don't see, you don't see.

a9e685b6-379b-4e7c-82c6-f69b883730f3-0
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.520
That's all it is.

9394c15a-5a6b-410f-8e24-6a5ed697b3a7-0
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.065
Just that the problem with people or the problem with the

9394c15a-5a6b-410f-8e24-6a5ed697b3a7-1
00:07:52.065 --> 00:08:00.001
mind is if it doesn't have a goal, it doesn't know how to be

9394c15a-5a6b-410f-8e24-6a5ed697b3a7-2
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:08.587
intense, just to sit here and be absolutely intense, knowing that

9394c15a-5a6b-410f-8e24-6a5ed697b3a7-3
00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:11.320
there is no tomorrow.

39ba2424-6afc-42e7-84c1-efb77b0a06a0-0
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.056
Still, to be intense and involved in today is the

39ba2424-6afc-42e7-84c1-efb77b0a06a0-1
00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:19.720
fundamental quality of spiritual life.

64afaa4f-25e8-467f-895a-1395f689bdd1-0
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.880
Suppose I'm going to die tomorrow morning.

09d1fbaa-7ef2-4c1d-8629-f7ac7a56976f-0
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.184
If I have to be here, I will be the same way, with utmost

09d1fbaa-7ef2-4c1d-8629-f7ac7a56976f-1
00:08:36.184 --> 00:08:40.520
involvement, with utmost intensity.

44d187cf-b6f6-4941-b692-e84ad378f148-0
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.360
Tomorrow morning.

180deb41-10f5-4aa0-a152-52d4d7e70a47-0
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.413
Yeah, I may know what's tomorrow morning, but still that's not

180deb41-10f5-4aa0-a152-52d4d7e70a47-1
00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:51.880
going to influence my today, my this moment.

e29e9bf9-1e2a-4fde-9b27-04e052f26d83-0
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.200
So tomorrow morning you may touch heaven.

e01d9aba-8d71-4d9c-b66d-83ded0e1c0f3-0
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.240
It doesn't matter.

d796a76b-d4df-44b4-8a5c-f6ed2f7308d5-0
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.920
Tomorrow morning may be hell, it doesn't matter.

a8b60de6-8400-4c76-8e6d-94f09ff6b330-0
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.600
That doesn't mean we are not prepared for tomorrow.

7d1095be-d1fa-4fac-97ec-05290b9b3d27-0
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.251
It is just that just maintaining that intensity, not being

7d1095be-d1fa-4fac-97ec-05290b9b3d27-1
00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:14.102
concerned about where you will go, is very, very essential

7d1095be-d1fa-4fac-97ec-05290b9b3d27-2
00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:14.760
quality.

380cc435-1ed2-4a98-bdd5-70dfedde92df-0
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.105
If a person wants to evolve spiritually, the moment he sets

380cc435-1ed2-4a98-bdd5-70dfedde92df-1
00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:23.680
a goal then he has destroyed the seeking.

106e5b62-e9d2-4139-b964-fa28fa5579a3-0
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.960
To seek means you can only seek that which you do not know you.

58df6e5d-4466-4ad6-9290-aa4c614b90bc-0
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.847
Seeking that you think you already know is just senseless,

58df6e5d-4466-4ad6-9290-aa4c614b90bc-1
00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:40.440
isn't it?

41c9d4a2-922a-4abc-95ce-12024829edfa-0
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.200
When you say I'm seeking, it means I do not know.

d2dee0bd-1e12-49ff-8128-d62a8319b1a5-0
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.480
That's why I'm seeking.

5cb1de54-3fed-4eac-be05-c247e73bd4b8-0
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.560
If I already know what is there to seek.

5263a90a-6c1a-446c-b2df-3c7372ac0eaf-0
00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.340
The moment you make a conclusion about anything as what could be

5263a90a-6c1a-446c-b2df-3c7372ac0eaf-1
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.200
that, then you have destroyed your seeking.

3878d206-45dd-4ced-908d-a26ff8fad48a-0
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.651
You may spend a lifetime believing you're seeking, not

3878d206-45dd-4ced-908d-a26ff8fad48a-1
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:13.481
seeking, just trying to make life agree with your

3878d206-45dd-4ced-908d-a26ff8fad48a-2
00:10:13.481 --> 00:10:14.400
conclusions.

81f8a588-8573-4819-8cd8-4ab5eb23b956-0
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.560
This is the foolish effort that everybody is doing in the world.

d7b79a96-df48-4570-a2f6-4bb08f0c21f8-0
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.400
They want life to agree to their conclusions.

d3070fb2-ec71-4d2a-8556-57842c6fa485-0
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.400
In their mind, that's their struggle.

94090836-8ddf-45a1-8d6a-6e1d61246c79-0
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.660
They're trying to readjust life in a million ways so that it

94090836-8ddf-45a1-8d6a-6e1d61246c79-1
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.440
agrees with their conclusions of what it should be.

104ee3b4-e2d7-4d28-943d-002428ccfeaf-0
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.760
So don't fall into the same trap.

ef7ad872-85a4-462a-aa88-16abe83da6c6-0
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.440
If you're aware you have been in an illusion, it's good.

2bf82540-3dde-414d-b825-317e1a0ee379-0
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.076
Now you should become aware that you're still in another kind of

2bf82540-3dde-414d-b825-317e1a0ee379-1
00:10:51.076 --> 00:10:51.680
illusion.

2c4134dd-d4eb-469f-b718-0c3d2f2f8763-0
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.680
That's better.

49bd189d-0a23-4094-98d1-99c28996811b-0
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.455
Tomorrow, when you step into the most beautiful place within

49bd189d-0a23-4094-98d1-99c28996811b-1
00:10:57.455 --> 00:10:59.680
yourself, you still know you're in illusion.

b11c3db0-e121-4e6b-a90b-cc8a003bdc34-0
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.640
That's great.

5bc83751-31e0-480e-a5c6-faad238102fa-0
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.440
When all illusions fall away, what do I do?

9726b5be-330e-4b40-9059-ae262c79e986-0
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.720
What is there to do?

bbbdf6e6-0ae6-42e4-96e8-610274b4f168-0
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:17.200
Like to put it very simply, to put it in almost childlike way.

95a27259-6fca-476e-8f7e-099e93b66425-0
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.920
I think somebody, it's very famous.

569743d1-8583-43cf-a656-16ba42783d5c-0
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.840
Whoever said this, some Zen person said this.

c7e7eae7-6393-4018-8590-b7ab068ecdd8-0
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.480
Somebody asked how was it?

597851d9-d1ec-449b-9960-1501dca407b8-0
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.360
You're enlightened now.

0331f318-2bc5-44b7-8cba-e0b2b3a6a8ce-0
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.200
How does it feel?

66885941-898f-4fd0-a691-aceef69087af-0
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.720
He looked up at him and said what?

8e6a845a-5120-4b46-ad42-12ffd399e426-0
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:44.710
Before Enlightenment, it was chopping the wood, washing the

8e6a845a-5120-4b46-ad42-12ffd399e426-1
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.360
dishes, carrying water.

1b294796-4c9a-4771-9ecb-e0c7cbc6bd5b-0
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.893
After enlightenment, chopping the wood, washing the dishes,

1b294796-4c9a-4771-9ecb-e0c7cbc6bd5b-1
00:11:51.893 --> 00:11:53.000
carrying the water.

ca3f35aa-383c-45c1-9098-5cc7d79f8c77-0
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.640
That's all.

bfc1ccea-43e2-47bc-9419-8383ae990775-0
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:03.120
Then why get enlightened without it?

8711d4f3-2369-4cee-a94b-28d6f036569f-0
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.920
Without it, you'll always be hankering.

6b33e968-9de1-4007-be3a-80ea35516fdb-0
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.160
Now the hankering has stopped.

b9d810cc-8e82-44fd-89da-a73a46e636ae-0
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.680
There is no need to hanker for anything.

7524128e-e655-4096-82bb-f0bcad1f174b-0
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.760
It's so complete.

edb0a42c-e71f-4c51-b307-553298cd6c7f-0
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.070
The same act of chopping the wood, washing the dishes and

edb0a42c-e71f-4c51-b307-553298cd6c7f-1
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.960
carrying the water is not same anymore.

059ee827-92ac-4105-b045-167ad870cb4c-0
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.360
Everything has changed.

6a9a9b98-0d52-42d9-a338-6f8b640b5acd-0
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.287
Everything has so changed so dramatically within you that

6a9a9b98-0d52-42d9-a338-6f8b640b5acd-1
00:12:28.287 --> 00:12:30.600
there's no need to change anything outside.

8694863a-78ff-4267-a83a-a3f961a28595-0
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.947
There's absolutely no need to make any changes outside,

8694863a-78ff-4267-a83a-a3f961a28595-1
00:12:35.947 --> 00:12:38.920
because the inside has changed so dramatically.

d2c75452-552d-4777-9434-7872405f31f8-0
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.800
It's gone through an absolute revolution.

5ae3f21d-b7a4-404d-b6d3-9d762bb3fad2-0
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.080
Nothing of the old is left within.

ae7006ae-ef9c-401a-9733-36f02be6f873-0
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.360
So outside, what does it matter?

9baf9bf8-b852-4caa-a81d-c3261f2227a8-0
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.560
Still chop the wood, wash the dishes, Carry the water.
