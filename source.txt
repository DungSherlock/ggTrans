Or tambourn who can convert a stone into goddess, can't he convert a woman into goddess or a man into your God?
Should it be not possible? Very much possible.
Whether problem is the reason why we prefer stones is just to convince you my life time would pass. lived time would pass.
And every day you could change your erection of life.
Your thoughts, your emotions, your ideas, your opinions can keep changing and you keep changing the direction of your life.
That.. that's a reason why really human beings have been chosen, but it's not that they have not been chosen.
When we say somebody is a Brahmajati, that means he's in the path of the Divine.
..that means he is striving to become Godlike.
That's what it means.
Certain sadhana has been given, a basic sadhana has been given.
If you put this through for certain period of time, then something else can be done.
To do that something else you have to wait and wait and wait.
They won't let you do it in a day or two.
You know?
So, this Living Goddess tradition is a absolutely fantastic tradition, but the problem with such processes is, if there is one person who is fully aware, who knows what it is, then it will happen in a miraculous way.
Otherwise, it could be easily misused.
That's a whole thing.
That's a whole thing about everything, isn't it so?
Isn't it so?
Right now, for example, modern science.
If properly employed, it can be miraculous.
But I think, to a large extent, science is only misused.
Right now.
In the sense, anything that anybody can do, they're just doing it without considering whether this is good for the world or not, isn't it?
So similarly, with inner sciences, also the same thing, it has seen misuse at different times.
So, we don't have to just look at the misuse.
The essential use of it is what we have to see.
If you look at it that way, that is really a fantastic and fabulous tradition of making a woman into your goddess.
If you can make one woman into your goddess, you can slowly turn every one into your goddess, isn't it?
If everybody's willing, one is a good example, isn't it?
Isn't it so?
A woman who's born like anybody else, if she can become a goddess, the possibility is open to everybody at some point, isn't it?
You know my great grandmother.
People used to say, she's a devil of a woman.
When I saw her, she was over 100 years of age.
They called her a devil of a woman not because she ever did any harm to anybody, but she had a laugh.
If she laughed, the entire street shook.
Like that she laughed.
Those days a woman was not supposed to laugh loudly.
She was not supposed to laugh.
I don't know how they lived with a woman who could not laugh, but anyway.
Yes.
So she would let out a hoot of laughter, which would disturb everybody.
Oh, this woman is laughing like this, she's a devil of a woman.
I was just four or five years of age.
I would think if devil is the laughing one,
God is a dead serious one.
Where do I want to go?
If she was devil, she was very attractive to me.
She lived a certain life.
She lived to be one, one, three hundred and thirteen years of age.
She was married into a very rich family, a big land-holding family.
When she was sixty-eight years of age, she, after her husband had died, she left the family, went out, and built a small temple for herself.
She did not install a God, she installed herself in the temple.
She loved her own thing, her own type of worship, her own type of everything, and she can tell you anything.
When she's there sitting in the temple, she can just tell you about anything in the world.
I've seen many women like this who just sitting in one little temple all by themselves.
Even today there are, but there used to be lots of them.
When we were children, there used to be a lot of them.
It's come down so dramatically in just a matter of twenty-five thirty years.
And I remember going and sitting with these ladies, generally they were old by then, most of them, a few of them young ones, some of them sat naked, young women.
In that temple they always sat naked.
Big problem, the police are arresting them and putting them in the prison now, because they're walking naked.
Even today millions of yogis walk naked.
It won't be long before they will also be put behind bars and forced to wear clothes or whatever.
There's a big controversy in Andhra Pradesh, you know one woman.
One, she's a Devi, whatever she called.
She just walked naked all the time.
She was around thirty-two years of age, and a well-built woman.
The putter behind bars, she refused to wear clothes.
Then the putter behind bars, they wouldn't let her go.
And then she was willing to smear my downward body so that they can't see her body.
But she refused to wear clothes.
You know the history of Europe, where spiritual process was so widespread and how systematically it was uprooted and thrown out when they wanted to establish an organized religion.
So all those millions of witches who were burned are just those women who exhibited certain qualities which did not fit into the logical, logic of that society.
My great grandmother, for sure, would have been burned as a witch.
In India, they wouldn't burn, but they were afraid of her laughter.
She's definitely a witch.
So we need witches.
We need witches in the world.
We need women who are more capable than their logic.
We need men also like that.
We need human beings who are capable of perceiving, understanding, experiencing, life, beyond the horrible limitations of logic.
I want to at least produce three to five real devish.
Really, I mean flesh and blood woman to convert them into true goddesses of different qualities.
And people can experience them as such.
Only thing is the risk of what happens later is holding us back.
Now you make somebody into your goddess for a certain period of time.
Now people have such funny expectations out of that person that they won't let her breathe.
That's what has happened now, you know.
She's not supposed to do anything which is normal.
So people are disappointed if she goes in peace.
Oh, she's a goddess, how can she be?
You know, this is the kind of silly expectations that people have.
So this danger is holding me back from converting a few women into true goddesses.
We have enough people with sufficient energy. We just have to put them through certain processes to get them there.
In energy they are there.
It is just that they don't have an understanding of their energy to make it in a certain way.
They're just loosely energetic right now.
We can easily turn that around.
If you're willing to consider somebody only for seven days as a goddess and after that you're willing to behave normally with them, we could do that.
But once you say that, okay, this, this, this people were goddesses in that.
Either the thinking people who said this is total bullshit or the unthinking people will have all kinds of unfair expectations of that person with which nobody can live.
So the living goddess tradition is a very beautiful tradition.
But how it is right now, I don't know, I was talking to somebody if we could see her for ourselves.
But it seems she comes out only in particular days of the year or whatever.
Probably because to avoid this misunderstanding and unfair expectations they have kept her in a very protected atmosphere.
How well kept she is right now at this age, I don't know.
But it's very much possible if you can make a rocking to your goddess.
Why can't you make a living woman into your goddess?
You're better much can.
