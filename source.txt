00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.575
Ladies and gentlemen, for the very first time in the history

b77ff280-b041-4f9d-9b65-645225ab1766-1
00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:47.240
of humanity.

fefbccaa-f376-4336-83d3-bb2a5e1f8b8b-0
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.560
We have the necessary resource.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.600
We have the necessary capability.

0e9fb24f-2dbe-40f1-ae16-e1affdee4b0e-0
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.640
We have the necessary technology to address every human problem

0e9fb24f-2dbe-40f1-ae16-e1affdee4b0e-1
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.480
on the planet.

cd06e21c-ea11-4f28-99ea-0da82eb40153-0
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.384
Even 25 years ago we couldn't have dreamt of it, but the only

cd06e21c-ea11-4f28-99ea-0da82eb40153-1
00:13:01.384 --> 00:13:04.420
thing that is missing is consciousness.

aa02fc63-cdae-4f90-92b7-1ee865d0d29e-0
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.448
The 100 day journey spanning
30,000 kilometres from London to

aa02fc63-cdae-4f90-92b7-1ee865d0d29e-1
00:13:09.448 --> 00:13:13.716
India as part of a safe soil campaign to change the world and

aa02fc63-cdae-4f90-92b7-1ee865d0d29e-2
00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:15.300
make it a better place.

6eba0087-0f8c-43fb-9cff-db848d6b66ef-0
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.197
The whole purpose of this moment is to 1st to bring this home

6eba0087-0f8c-43fb-9cff-db848d6b66ef-1
00:13:21.197 --> 00:13:25.588
that when you walk up on the soil you know it is the source

6eba0087-0f8c-43fb-9cff-db848d6b66ef-2
00:13:25.588 --> 00:13:26.540
of your life.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.860
Keeping it alive is the most important thing.

c3074856-07ee-41d4-b9c2-d3acc21677d8-0
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.310
Will you make it happen?

6525f995-17cd-4467-8711-fdb1d13faa7f-0
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:37.152
Dear Sabbul, one of the world's voices and leaders of soil

6525f995-17cd-4467-8711-fdb1d13faa7f-1
00:13:37.152 --> 00:13:38.750
conservation and land.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.070
Extremely important.

1e1649b4-102c-4ef4-b6a7-03c5013acbb7-0
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.230
It must be a single point agenda, incentive based agenda.

5611a216-c7cc-40f7-b8e8-0dd4f9740945-0
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.130
I don't want this COP 15 to end as one more convention with more

5611a216-c7cc-40f7-b8e8-0dd4f9740945-1
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.390
paper and more paper.

965fb6fd-ef4d-49c9-9ba0-42facc4932a4-0
00:13:50.630 --> 00:14:01.300
This must end with concrete action and action in such a way

965fb6fd-ef4d-49c9-9ba0-42facc4932a4-1
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:11.260
that is it's implementable as part of conscious Planet.

a4961b8a-93ea-4ce4-b5f1-b5fcf56562b9-0
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.847
We started this safe soil movement which has been on for

a4961b8a-93ea-4ce4-b5f1-b5fcf56562b9-1
00:14:14.847 --> 00:14:15.980
over 30 years now.

4d38dda2-2d30-4579-bd2a-f9946ec87ff3-0
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.020
Initially it started this project Green Hands.

ca045d89-ca96-4a04-9076-ff599e2f6d89-0
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.380
Next thing is we started Rally for Rivers.

af3cbc16-3c06-4a92-846f-71e1bf4f42fc-0
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.828
We're tracking a mammoth movement, an incredible rally

af3cbc16-3c06-4a92-846f-71e1bf4f42fc-1
00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:33.526
starting from Kanyakumari reaching up to the Himalayas

af3cbc16-3c06-4a92-846f-71e1bf4f42fc-2
00:14:33.526 --> 00:14:37.090
with the sole purpose of rejuvenating Indias Rivers.

65b45e0d-80fb-4e98-8197-1d0c67fb853e-0
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.530
Every state is responding.

c2e0752d-e6e5-41d0-9972-2b742decd2aa-0
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.260
This is concurrence and this is wonderful.

1ab2746d-b38d-43d4-a210-ab5707b8108a-0
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.173
This project, what we have taken up, called Kaveri calling, is an

1ab2746d-b38d-43d4-a210-ab5707b8108a-1
00:14:58.173 --> 00:15:01.791
offshoot of Rally for Rivers, These 83,000 square kilometers

1ab2746d-b38d-43d4-a210-ab5707b8108a-2
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:02.740
of Kaveri basin.

c094f30c-39e5-4049-8ba8-d2dd4e759f17-0
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.420
We want to bring it back, at least 1/3 of it back into some

c094f30c-39e5-4049-8ba8-d2dd4e759f17-1
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.820
kind of green cover.

31f4b916-03e0-4f75-9ec9-d0853d3ba959-0
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.081
India is putting money behind it, but 13 river basins on the

31f4b916-03e0-4f75-9ec9-d0853d3ba959-1
00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:18.000
lines of Kaveri calling they were allocated $2.4 billion.

21b06e18-fd8d-4996-ba79-2a836a08a94e-0
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.305
Right now, Kaveri calling project is being seen by the UN

21b06e18-fd8d-4996-ba79-2a836a08a94e-1
00:15:22.305 --> 00:15:26.160
agencies as a role model for tropical nations on the planet.

8030c4c6-8e3e-4c8a-bd26-2a8be364f9a1-0
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.720
One big moment that's happening right now is the farmers

8030c4c6-8e3e-4c8a-bd26-2a8be364f9a1-1
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.960
producer organization moment.

82bd7100-a9ad-45e3-a6d9-5f12fd9bcdc2-0
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.880
Today, we are managing 25 former producer organizations.

9b56e535-d7d4-4e08-80ab-2ee22658214b-0
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.252
In the next year or maximum 18
months, we want to make this

9b56e535-d7d4-4e08-80ab-2ee22658214b-1
00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:44.830
into 25,000 farmers.

e1d7dd82-3a65-4990-ab87-8a07639acf74-0
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.543
This can be scaled up into a massive possibility action for

e1d7dd82-3a65-4990-ab87-8a07639acf74-1
00:15:49.543 --> 00:15:54.214
rural rejuvenation is mainly aimed at rejuvenating the human

e1d7dd82-3a65-4990-ab87-8a07639acf74-2
00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:54.750
spirit.

ebbe175d-c10d-4f05-8127-3c7a9ced70c6-0
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.870
This is an incredible movement that has started in Tamil Nadu.

a3291ed3-4d68-4068-a423-dbe129412f6c-0
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.700
We want to see that this happens to the whole country.

aac5fbb9-d37b-47e3-b896-1d4f1dadfc2b-0
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.937
The idea is not necessarily about developing competitive

aac5fbb9-d37b-47e3-b896-1d4f1dadfc2b-1
00:16:07.937 --> 00:16:12.355
sport, but the important thing is to bring the spirit of sport

aac5fbb9-d37b-47e3-b896-1d4f1dadfc2b-2
00:16:12.355 --> 00:16:14.740
and revitalizing rural societies.

afcdb557-be20-4dbb-b455-81a678e7a836-0
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:24.440
Isha Outreach, English and computer skills are very

afcdb557-be20-4dbb-b455-81a678e7a836-1
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:33.787
essential to make these children come out of the hopeless

afcdb557-be20-4dbb-b455-81a678e7a836-2
00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:39.750
economic and social pit they are in.

b8a17f96-bd24-4d9a-b6a8-e0d34bcb8517-0
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.097
One important thing about fashion for peace is shifting

b8a17f96-bd24-4d9a-b6a8-e0d34bcb8517-1
00:16:45.097 --> 00:16:48.190
back to natural fibre as much as possible.

41c1f207-1ccf-4c4a-ad52-bf987afbe77e-0
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.830
The way we dress is destroying the world.

298561dd-5705-4739-84da-657fa9bb30b4-0
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.699
Textile has become the third largest polluter on the planet,

298561dd-5705-4739-84da-657fa9bb30b4-1
00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:56.730
the Poly fiber.

0f712b95-0bb4-42bd-bf20-bd57ec4b4583-0
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.855
It has entered our bodies, it's entered our water, soil, our

0f712b95-0bb4-42bd-bf20-bd57ec4b4583-1
00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:01.570
food cycle.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.378
This is not just about fashion, this is going to make millions

589f5b70-d6e0-4a3d-b508-017a74288450-1
00:17:06.378 --> 00:17:07.570
of people's lives.

d9108747-eae1-47f5-bbda-7ca213bed7d7-0
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.484
If you could first tell our viewers what is the idea behind

d9108747-eae1-47f5-bbda-7ca213bed7d7-1
00:17:11.484 --> 00:17:11.650
it?

d00e0ed6-53b3-40ee-accc-33299b44625b-0
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.400
Initiative, insight, which is more specific towards

d00e0ed6-53b3-40ee-accc-33299b44625b-1
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.410
entrepreneurs.

f6b66ccb-f2ca-4eef-ae8b-ce71d7e0013a-0
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.047
Whatever the nature of your business, ultimately it is all

f6b66ccb-f2ca-4eef-ae8b-ce71d7e0013a-1
00:17:20.047 --> 00:17:21.450
about human well-being.

5ddc12ce-59ce-414b-b837-5020bb182cb7-0
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.290
He spoke of something which he called inclusive economics.

ca3ba969-0102-4835-9043-0d8c8b9f0e2d-0
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.503
Inclusive economics wasn't a phrase anybody used six years

ca3ba969-0102-4835-9043-0d8c8b9f0e2d-1
00:17:33.503 --> 00:17:33.850
back.

8243c4d5-3332-48e5-989d-d5064ffb5411-0
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.888
We also went on to explain that this is holistic development is

8243c4d5-3332-48e5-989d-d5064ffb5411-1
00:17:38.888 --> 00:17:42.450
all about we have started a leadership institute.

99d9ade6-2844-425e-bbe2-fbca2b7fcecf-0
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.130
It's called Lisa Leadership Academy.

1893ebae-1031-4246-a434-b7a1a1a2deb4-0
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.130
The idea is to train leaders and all else.

88406373-0ba0-472a-8843-a33620649e36-0
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.591
When I say a leader, don't think only a Prime Minister, Chief

88406373-0ba0-472a-8843-a33620649e36-1
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:53.250
Minister, No.

d1343b9c-34f2-4d00-a475-889a2f826fb6-0
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.680
Anybody who can impact 10
people's life in a day easily.

a45ef4f1-239b-4cfd-ab4c-a2ad7cc373a1-0
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.656
We are launching a campaign called Youth and Truth, Youth

a45ef4f1-239b-4cfd-ab4c-a2ad7cc373a1-1
00:18:02.656 --> 00:18:03.880
and Truth Unplug.

50990e8b-3496-4d3a-a636-00404d063c61-0
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.480
Which said Guru, ask whatever you want.

850e7428-d7e0-4834-a90f-1c90f1303f31-0
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.740
I want to know the truth about ambition, technology, what is

850e7428-d7e0-4834-a90f-1c90f1303f31-1
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.520
the meaning of competition both for individuals and society.

8d2c1b61-421c-4d4e-82b8-5206941c11b8-0
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.400
But everyone of you, your life is precious, isn't it?

5d1286b9-c0a6-4909-abca-7e51203acbe4-0
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.860
This precious life.

f0fc16cf-bc50-469b-ac04-80d39e2733a8-0
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.180
Where are you going to invest it?

4f8a0993-a005-4a4d-9e80-bb5a887b90c7-0
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.862
What is it that will be worthwhile today and worthwhile

4f8a0993-a005-4a4d-9e80-bb5a887b90c7-1
00:18:30.862 --> 00:18:33.980
after 50 years for me to invest myself into you?

098d78e9-71ae-4c80-a95e-1294da2b1f4a-0
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.700
Invest your life into that?

ee204798-da6f-4568-ae7f-812ba320d7b2-0
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.700
This will be a life of fulfillment.

0b7c2722-cbc6-42d5-b7ab-299759b4a5a8-0
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.420
He has a difference, right?

f0080442-a913-4e08-a051-b04fc8c8e51b-0
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.300
He's kind of Buddha to us.

a4bb7b69-de3c-4778-91bb-f022c9bfcac9-0
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.140
Sadhguru has become this new friend of youth.

5c009c63-4438-48df-94bf-dd8c8124d7a1-0
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.072
We've engineered the outside world in so many ways, but we've

5c009c63-4438-48df-94bf-dd8c8124d7a1-1
00:18:53.072 --> 00:18:54.560
done nothing about this one.

b7f7063d-f1c2-4191-8251-114dde49dcae-0
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.360
If you want to know well-being in is the only way out.

6cd8c340-343a-49f5-a113-2aef2880ef33-0
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.840
This is what I want to teach you too.

e24d203f-b108-4f2b-afa8-b2abe4a1ae22-0
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.029
That is, you can be completely intoxicated without any drug,

e24d203f-b108-4f2b-afa8-b2abe4a1ae22-1
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.880
just on life.

d79fa4e2-02ad-4063-b266-632fe8686760-0
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.960
This is a shift from wine to divine.

b4961aea-469c-4ff9-826d-533aa6f9bd79-0
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.819
This is one thing we're trying to do, to build infrastructure

b4961aea-469c-4ff9-826d-533aa6f9bd79-1
00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:37.101
which is beyond religious divide, beyond any kind of

b4961aea-469c-4ff9-826d-533aa6f9bd79-2
00:19:37.101 --> 00:19:40.879
philosophy or belief system where every human being can seek

b4961aea-469c-4ff9-826d-533aa6f9bd79-3
00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:42.180
is in the well-being.

49af11c7-bfc4-4f74-9b98-e6a3d8358255-0
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.651
It's very important that we invest both physical

49af11c7-bfc4-4f74-9b98-e6a3d8358255-1
00:19:47.651 --> 00:19:51.761
infrastructure and human infrastructure, which focuses on

49af11c7-bfc4-4f74-9b98-e6a3d8358255-2
00:19:51.761 --> 00:19:54.170
the innermost core of who we are.

ef125a29-7dbb-4f93-86e9-a96bde3e068d-0
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.377
If you haven't described yourself in one word, would you

ef125a29-7dbb-4f93-86e9-a96bde3e068d-1
00:20:03.377 --> 00:20:06.810
consider wildlife as two words or one word?

d0050873-6826-4f3d-a39c-92b68e70f64e-0
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.130
Yes.

3c2bc392-a944-4f0d-9cf7-e1077ea2b966-0
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.522
In our lives, if we do not do what we cannot do, there is no

3c2bc392-a944-4f0d-9cf7-e1077ea2b966-1
00:20:28.522 --> 00:20:28.870
issue.

c3cbf2e9-0ca3-4196-9226-52748cec68bf-0
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.070
But if we do not do what we can do, we are a disastrous life.

efb55da5-ec97-47e5-a125-bf720c4f06ce-0
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.263
President Pranab Mukherjee soliciting Sadhguru for all his

efb55da5-ec97-47e5-a125-bf720c4f06ce-1
00:20:56.263 --> 00:20:57.430
spiritual contribution.

b52beda9-9ba7-4ff3-a8b5-53025646b945-0
00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:01.877
As a generation of people, we are empowered in a way that no

b52beda9-9ba7-4ff3-a8b5-53025646b945-1
00:21:01.877 --> 00:21:03.750
generation could ever imagine.

c1fa15b8-bb5c-4ae5-a61d-781b9e0c7197-0
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.550
If you want to raise human consciousness, this is the time.

85751a02-1ad3-45ec-bffc-3751a9172028-0
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:29.130
Did all of you complete the 1st
6 steps with Torah involvement?

36d1ee7b-c6bf-489d-949d-a28f8a0b98a2-0
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.090
Until now, you've been with Sadhguru.

ba78355b-f4b4-4253-8466-057bd7e2ea6a-0
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.410
You've explored A variety of aspects of life with Sadhguru.

7fcb875a-27e3-40f4-b6fd-22bbdc01d8a0-1
00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:47.039
a step deeper and receive the powerful tool of Shambhavi

7fcb875a-27e3-40f4-b6fd-22bbdc01d8a0-2
00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.130
Mahamud Rakriya.

defbcb7b-599b-4c74-a306-e129df545b9e-0
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.349
The significance of what is being offered here is to move

defbcb7b-599b-4c74-a306-e129df545b9e-1
00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:56.730
from intellectual understanding to inner experience.

91ddd458-57a9-47f2-a60b-8f7eb1f8657f-0
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.910
It is one thing to understand something logically and it is

91ddd458-57a9-47f2-a60b-8f7eb1f8657f-1
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.603
something totally different to turn it into a living

91ddd458-57a9-47f2-a60b-8f7eb1f8657f-2
00:22:05.603 --> 00:22:06.370
experience.

7fa69050-b770-4f36-adce-90bddeae23ed-0
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.338
So this is an opportunity for you to to transform your your

7fa69050-b770-4f36-adce-90bddeae23ed-1
00:22:12.338 --> 00:22:16.707
experience, to bring about a profound transformation to the

7fa69050-b770-4f36-adce-90bddeae23ed-2
00:22:16.707 --> 00:22:20.929
very way you perceive and experience life, and to receive

7fa69050-b770-4f36-adce-90bddeae23ed-3
00:22:20.929 --> 00:22:25.079
a powerful tool to create your life the way you want it.

efb8c928-dae6-4ec8-81eb-bcc67f6015ef-0
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.303
We're not here to propound a philosophy, not to teach you a

efb8c928-dae6-4ec8-81eb-bcc67f6015ef-1
00:22:30.303 --> 00:22:34.552
new ideology, not to convert you into a new religion, not even to

efb8c928-dae6-4ec8-81eb-bcc67f6015ef-2
00:22:34.552 --> 00:22:35.840
give you a teaching.

8d4b7655-e5bc-407d-a2bd-6c2165d7cdd2-0
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.480
This is transmission.

f65f3516-cc5d-4007-bbc8-6a7851b0e504-0
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.120
It is not something that can be communicated in words.

e8cd7a20-470d-4c0e-939e-e49963c64bcc-0
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.101
So if this transmission has to happen, you need to be in a

e8cd7a20-470d-4c0e-939e-e49963c64bcc-1
00:22:46.101 --> 00:22:49.120
certain state of receptivity and openness.

856c5eb5-9da7-42e1-bca9-ed27131998db-0
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.428
We'll be starting with a few perpetrary steps and practices

856c5eb5-9da7-42e1-bca9-ed27131998db-1
00:22:54.428 --> 00:22:58.917
which will be a support for you to become open and receptive to

856c5eb5-9da7-42e1-bca9-ed27131998db-2
00:22:58.917 --> 00:23:00.180
this transmission.

013d1057-0b47-4766-b838-7cef2dba8ed1-0
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.573
My life has been profoundly transformed and this practice

013d1057-0b47-4766-b838-7cef2dba8ed1-1
00:23:05.573 --> 00:23:08.420
has transformed the life of

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.932
That's why as a movement, Isha has impacted over a billion

8fb9986d-64e9-4e33-a281-fd48c9e19e92-1
00:23:12.932 --> 00:23:14.540
people around the world.

c2cffb25-8e29-4418-af9f-3167d807513f-0
00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.900
A movement which is non religious, non denominational.

095874e4-62aa-4f5e-949f-a1f6d8e363dc-0
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:24.405
It's not a ticket to heaven, but towards us taking responsibility

095874e4-62aa-4f5e-949f-a1f6d8e363dc-1
00:23:24.405 --> 00:23:28.593
of transforming ourselves into wonderful human beings and

095874e4-62aa-4f5e-949f-a1f6d8e363dc-2
00:23:28.593 --> 00:23:30.760
creating a wonderful humanity.

3b618184-e6ed-4932-a28a-b393187b60fc-0
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.768
Now whatever that we're going to do in this two days, we need a

3b618184-e6ed-4932-a28a-b393187b60fc-1
00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:40.600
certain atmosphere to make it happen.

08be68f6-818c-481a-8cd0-44913fe7b83d-0
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.080
So the next two days, there's no yoga here.

457e2539-04fa-4d72-9462-06e0e08c1c54-0
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.680
We're just going to play a game.

bea60410-80f4-4573-b4aa-7406e0968dd2-0
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.200
Is it OK?

5a450c98-a993-4fca-8110-5a495e264c70-0
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.760
Is it OK with you?

cc64d7a8-3cb6-4c0a-95df-383197465215-0
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.380
Some of you are not responding.

26c96941-a516-4220-bda4-9e9d37af1f65-0
00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.199
Those of you joining us from Vietnam, is it too early for

26c96941-a516-4220-bda4-9e9d37af1f65-1
00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:54.380
you?

3854786a-6328-419e-94e6-d6d325f488ac-0
00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:03.595
So if you want to play a game, the first and foremost thing

3854786a-6328-419e-94e6-d6d325f488ac-1
00:24:03.595 --> 00:24:06.580
that you need is participation.

2041930f-227c-46a2-a0a2-3f8d59ad0fb4-0
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.140
Your participation should be
100%.

8207414c-f03e-42a9-ba18-dc213b5b377a-0
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.620
You can go to your office half hour daily.

7a97c86c-602d-4a20-b4ae-474314785f6f-0
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.940
You can walk on the street half hour daily.

78aff685-6658-49e2-9e4e-84c20a8cb07a-0
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.350
You can go to a party half hourly.

7d19b1fe-0f68-4301-9f11-bbaac9a76d50-0
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.510
You can even get married half hourly.

3db2815a-65f9-4a21-83c1-ce2e62872bda-0
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.498
But if you want to play a game, you must throw yourself into it,

3db2815a-65f9-4a21-83c1-ce2e62872bda-1
00:24:28.498 --> 00:24:28.990
isn't it?

02d0c95c-3631-4ab4-aada-e72370b2dcab-0
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.470
Otherwise there is no game.

c926faa4-0fb0-44e2-820b-850dc69e69cf-0
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.790
Let's say tomorrow you want to play tennis with your friend.

b9750d93-493c-4f53-80ae-b31b6e070e07-0
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.606
Your friend is playing with total involvement and you're

b9750d93-493c-4f53-80ae-b31b6e070e07-1
00:24:41.606 --> 00:24:42.150
like this.

71571030-ddb2-4d86-b8ba-2f7b7da297ac-0
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.950
Whenever the ball comes, what will happen?

74df8755-2c66-44c1-9893-ece2faf792fb-0
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:48.960
What will happen?

9b9c4bc6-6396-4327-b9b3-474f84e301c7-0
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.960
Your friend's tennis record will be around your neck.

45102a49-6f32-4279-bd0c-ab425741d180-0
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.200
That's what will happen, isn't it?

ea66ba3d-9875-41c1-b3b6-b2b9b1a78119-0
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.776
If he's playing with total involvement every, and if you're

ea66ba3d-9875-41c1-b3b6-b2b9b1a78119-1
00:24:58.776 --> 00:25:02.406
doing this, then definitely he's going to bang it on your head

ea66ba3d-9875-41c1-b3b6-b2b9b1a78119-2
00:25:02.406 --> 00:25:03.039
and go yes.

7d30e25e-15f9-43ab-acba-5e0a08926656-0
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.520
So I'm playing this game with absolute involvement.

697debac-f572-4000-bf4c-171341948dfe-0
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.812
If you're doing this whenever I ask you a question, then I'm

697debac-f572-4000-bf4c-171341948dfe-1
00:25:14.812 --> 00:25:18.760
going to bang it on your head and go yes.

6511e2ac-135d-4bb4-8b24-6d7369eb7c23-0
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.640
So can we play this game with absolute involvement?

40b0c7cf-a0e3-4cb5-ba35-406b12267fa9-0
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:23.880
Can we?

9f71d715-4a23-4354-a845-b4d13635b49f-0
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.200
Because otherwise there is no game.

63690aa1-6727-493a-a2b0-40e0d5970f0d-0
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.120
You cannot play a game half heartedly.

0a2bbda4-3472-4401-a3ba-fd05c95b4fb4-0
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.640
The next thing about playing a game is you must have a desire.

d2e0cd39-ec53-4352-98af-98b793a8cf2c-0
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.040
I want to win.

473d5fa8-15ca-4bfe-bd72-a0458c872b7d-0
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.000
I want to lose this game.

6526a6db-5da9-4338-b32f-f963ecdc8ae8-0
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.120
Can you play a game?

019ea7bb-b191-4386-9780-6b8148d71434-0
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.200
I want to win, but if I lose it, it's OK with me.

fb0b9512-7a3b-41d2-9a71-dc39ac6c5c35-0
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.040
No, no, no, no.

e9431677-2a09-412f-ad32-b1671d215317-0
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.720
I cannot win.

c52cc213-0a5c-47b1-8783-b636fa0790cc-0
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.920
Only I must win.

b22a3396-e43d-4195-8085-352c81a21800-0
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.040
Can you play a game?

5ab2250d-fd9f-4c7c-ae2f-c22d2b8e8e88-0
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.520
I know, isn't it?

5fa59d40-0a37-4aa7-ac4c-7a80d81ba979-0
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.720
I really want to win, but if I lose, it is OK with me.

fcdd266b-a2e4-444e-9592-8b91a4e6b5f7-0
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.320
Only then you can play a game, isn't it?

a68d9878-38c9-4487-a03d-c74567f945a0-0
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.299
So this two days you're sitting here, if nothing happens, is it

a68d9878-38c9-4487-a03d-c74567f945a0-1
00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:02.520
OK?

673aeeef-1421-47fe-b565-fdc4d678a1b3-0
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.680
Suppose nothing happened?

38221bce-d7ef-414b-a964-d6501d7135bc-0
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.040
Is it OK with you?

3c208e0e-bf0c-4b2e-8768-cfcccd21102a-0
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.960
Some of you are not responding.

49bc54a4-757b-42d2-bee0-8ea6e14181cc-0
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.522
So why we're saying this is you should not be too preoccupied

49bc54a4-757b-42d2-bee0-8ea6e14181cc-1
00:26:18.522 --> 00:26:21.910
with what is going to happen in the end.

c3de9cf6-9871-49f7-a974-b2290a371890-0
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:27.140
In yoga, we say if you set one eye on the goal, you only have

c3de9cf6-9871-49f7-a974-b2290a371890-1
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.830
one eye to find your way.

34b5f55f-94a8-44d1-9ec7-aa8fd36368cb-0
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.030
This is not a good way to find your way.

aaa9531e-3cd7-4293-a90e-8e850e0e2a33-0
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.642
You use both your eyes to find your way and according to your

aaa9531e-3cd7-4293-a90e-8e850e0e2a33-1
00:26:34.642 --> 00:26:38.255
capabilities, you reach where you need to reach anyway, isn't

aaa9531e-3cd7-4293-a90e-8e850e0e2a33-2
00:26:38.255 --> 00:26:38.429
it?

192bca67-191b-4944-8da3-0f0bf33c8d75-0
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.230
So when you play a game-winning is not important.

efd2a0de-61e3-44be-9a40-edb17b6337c7-0
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.630
What is important is you play to your full capacity.

e2230e98-ae2b-4154-9c40-a197fc95dede-0
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.194
So if nothing happens in the end, in the next, in the end of

e2230e98-ae2b-4154-9c40-a197fc95dede-1
00:26:50.194 --> 00:26:51.450
these two days, is it OK?

5291a334-c5a1-42e6-9f18-0037b3c01970-0
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.250
Yes, we're getting there.

47f887d2-aa87-451d-b57d-c26d886f7063-0
00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:02.215
Now before we start this game, we thought we should get to know

47f887d2-aa87-451d-b57d-c26d886f7063-1
00:27:02.215 --> 00:27:03.090
each other.

4395aee8-538e-454d-b5ec-a5e0ba68e436-0
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.210
Now let's spend some time getting to know each other.

85a8f6fa-8a14-4888-b04b-5b48d11bb49a-0
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:15.095
So in this group we have around
580 people coming from all over

85a8f6fa-8a14-4888-b04b-5b48d11bb49a-1
00:27:15.095 --> 00:27:16.140
the world.

e02e9e40-343a-4afc-a97f-3a4f6cf3b159-0
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.513
I cannot mention all of the names right now, all of the the,

e02e9e40-343a-4afc-a97f-3a4f6cf3b159-1
00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:23.853
I cannot list all of the the countries because it's such a

e02e9e40-343a-4afc-a97f-3a4f6cf3b159-2
00:27:23.853 --> 00:27:24.420
long list.

21d7f83f-986b-4fa8-bdf0-9742d078749f-0
00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.735
But it's really wonderful to see so many of you joining us today

21d7f83f-986b-4fa8-bdf0-9742d078749f-1
00:27:28.735 --> 00:27:30.020
from around the world.

2e46af30-8b85-42a8-a396-2949baa9c729-0
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.779
And they're also in addition to all of you, they are also

2e46af30-8b85-42a8-a396-2949baa9c729-1
00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:37.027
volunteers who are supporting you during this session that is

2e46af30-8b85-42a8-a396-2949baa9c729-2
00:27:37.027 --> 00:27:39.700
also joining us from different parts of the world.

d9dedb2f-d375-4bd9-9b63-c09b853041fb-0
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.102
My name is Rusma and I'm a full time volunteer with Isha

d9dedb2f-d375-4bd9-9b63-c09b853041fb-1
00:27:45.102 --> 00:27:45.790
Foundation.

c2386a0f-5424-4732-9596-8fc1bdd700e8-0
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.570
Now if you want to play any game, what is the first thing

c2386a0f-5424-4732-9596-8fc1bdd700e8-1
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.910
that you should know?

6090ce0e-56fe-4314-81a8-1017d650667f-0
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.790
What is it?

b72945b6-79de-4054-b04b-194eb2f5fa59-0
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:57.590
Rules of the game?

39f8e29f-6b0c-4252-9c2d-57e81faa9148-0
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.670
Yes.

63e60038-7d2f-4eb3-8abd-d1048f167bb3-0
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.150
Oh, we thought, this is about liberation.

6b3273fc-de83-4307-ad61-b22ecb3863fa-0
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.630
Here also rules.

04ddca18-cd42-44bf-98df-581a3aa6bfbe-0
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.670
Is there any place in existence where there are no rules?

c48185d6-a57a-4587-9f01-ebb5b184aed1-0
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.550
There are rules everywhere, isn't it?

62b955fc-122c-4126-81c0-adb6ba43cca2-0
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.730
Some might be written down, some might not be written down.

c200aba8-9fa0-43e0-aa62-44943a517929-0
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.610
But there always are rules.

283d80b1-118a-403f-80fb-3375025c50cd-0
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.930
Let's say right now I want to sit here.

5ba55165-2ee4-42b1-bbda-46663170813b-0
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.393
If I say I've never met this Isaac Newton guy, I don't like

5ba55165-2ee4-42b1-bbda-46663170813b-1
00:28:22.393 --> 00:28:23.690
the rules of gravity.

efa39ff6-e580-481c-ae88-1e22bf773c87-0
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.530
I'm just going to walk off the terrace.

c4902239-536a-4c4b-80b2-9349b7fdd93d-0
00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.490
There's a price to pay, isn't it?

e85eed61-7fc0-4ea8-b6d1-a3db0ce987e6-0
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.574
So in every situations, whether the rules are main made or

e85eed61-7fc0-4ea8-b6d1-a3db0ce987e6-1
00:28:31.574 --> 00:28:35.457
otherwise, if you're not in tune with the rules of the game, you

e85eed61-7fc0-4ea8-b6d1-a3db0ce987e6-2
00:28:35.457 --> 00:28:37.250
cannot play that game as well.

afdbe57a-c15c-4361-bccc-cafce014add9-0
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.640
So shall we look at the rules of this game?

c87c5748-303a-41ef-852c-fe60e7664854-0
00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.398
Just a few things to make these things happen and if you have

c87c5748-303a-41ef-852c-fe60e7664854-1
00:28:46.398 --> 00:28:50.499
any problems with any of the rules, please raise your hands

c87c5748-303a-41ef-852c-fe60e7664854-2
00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:51.320
and said so.

792bdf69-9dcd-4a1a-a9ce-cd33e6b1b794-0
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.000
Don't just sit there like this, OK?

20aa799c-04f4-4731-8d67-ffb84ecc6275-0
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.973
The first rules is your participation in all the

20aa799c-04f4-4731-8d67-ffb84ecc6275-1
00:28:59.973 --> 00:29:02.840
sessions is required to complete the program.

47058a64-2df6-4606-9b1d-0b5d5f50f560-0
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.418
Because this is a step by step process, there's a total of

47058a64-2df6-4606-9b1d-0b5d5f50f560-1
00:29:07.418 --> 00:29:08.400
three sessions.

0decf019-ace6-4c44-89c2-b222c1dd0a57-0
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.365
If you miss a session, you will not be able to continue with the

0decf019-ace6-4c44-89c2-b222c1dd0a57-1
00:29:12.365 --> 00:29:12.760
program.

f5c3be66-7bae-4ed6-afe6-8f748c4599a6-0
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.398
So will you make sure that you participate in all the sessions

f5c3be66-7bae-4ed6-afe6-8f748c4599a6-1
00:29:18.398 --> 00:29:19.160
completely?

267fbb3a-7e37-43e9-8fea-7612023d7d0d-0
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.200
Yes.

e84e65c7-a189-4b1d-93bb-0eb57553704a-0
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.232
The next rule is whatever time that we announce for the

e84e65c7-a189-4b1d-93bb-0eb57553704a-1
00:29:28.232 --> 00:29:31.440
session, you're required to be here on time.

e9dd1beb-3fa9-412c-877e-0e25fc64dfa8-0
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.520
So can you make sure you do this?

013ac02b-326f-489a-bede-7a9ba8e2db01-0
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.880
That you'll join on time?

05e153f5-f0df-4095-a8ba-45c00e30f211-0
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.385
Because if even if you're a minute late, you could miss some

05e153f5-f0df-4095-a8ba-45c00e30f211-1
00:29:41.385 --> 00:29:43.050
important instructions.

1b71d269-c3fb-437f-9ef7-435b92135533-0
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.490
All of these practices are very subtle processes.

e7f28ae1-95d5-4877-827a-2cf2b6de46d7-0
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.700
If you attempt them without receiving all the all the

e7f28ae1-95d5-4877-827a-2cf2b6de46d7-1
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.570
necessary instructions, it will not work.

0691b4d9-f0d3-48b7-b991-5426c34b5fbb-0
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.807
And it could also cause damage to yourself by doing these

0691b4d9-f0d3-48b7-b991-5426c34b5fbb-1
00:29:57.807 --> 00:29:58.290
things.

21fd0546-6dcd-4027-b447-81564c359829-0
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.650
So if you're late, you may not be able to join the session.

606d29ab-5270-44aa-b583-63c11c1f6323-0
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.408
We notice that a few of you are late today, so from tomorrow

606d29ab-5270-44aa-b583-63c11c1f6323-1
00:30:08.408 --> 00:30:12.460
onwards the system will close itself at the announce time.

6077391e-6873-412a-b596-9ebea583d5cf-0
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.580
We are clarifying on this the importance of this so that you

6077391e-6873-412a-b596-9ebea583d5cf-1
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.060
can plan ahead and be here on time.

19edaccc-c423-48c0-afd1-8eaf3b8af608-0
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.002
The next aspect is all the practices that we offer here

19edaccc-c423-48c0-afd1-8eaf3b8af608-1
00:30:26.002 --> 00:30:28.420
have to be done on empty stomach.

a3438b26-86a8-478e-8fd5-c52008307e18-0
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.935
Empty stomach means if you have a full meal, there has to be a

a3438b26-86a8-478e-8fd5-c52008307e18-1
00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:33.820
four hours gap.

a2ffb895-0f4f-4e0d-8ebc-8365cfaee970-0
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:38.090
So there has to be a there has to be a four hours gap after you

a2ffb895-0f4f-4e0d-8ebc-8365cfaee970-1
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.588
have a full meal before you do the practice if you have a

a2ffb895-0f4f-4e0d-8ebc-8365cfaee970-2
00:30:41.588 --> 00:30:41.950
snack.

722ba450-2e05-4e46-bd49-fb044856383f-0
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:46.590
By snack I didn't mean 4
doughnuts or two bags of chips.

72c82b53-c0b3-4892-9110-e8c8680b131a-0
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.750
Snack means just a fruits or a few biscuits.

a32445cc-536e-4f00-a325-5fd09a260eb3-0
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.603
So after snacks, there has to be a 2 1/2 hour gaps before you do

a32445cc-536e-4f00-a325-5fd09a260eb3-1
00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:56.470
the practice.

58f22d15-2187-4398-98fd-f6fa2d95c69f-0
00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:03.339
If you consume a beverage like tea or coffee or milk, there has

58f22d15-2187-4398-98fd-f6fa2d95c69f-1
00:31:03.339 --> 00:31:05.360
to be a 1 1/2 hour gaps.

be711b69-82a0-4528-af8a-1d5cfa09770e-0
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.400
And if you smoke cigarettes, there has to be a 1 1/2 hours

be711b69-82a0-4528-af8a-1d5cfa09770e-1
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.640
gap if you drink any of the the alcoholic beverages.

190d279c-4698-4753-b6e1-12b726bc0e29-0
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.480
Minimum of eight hours gap before you do the practices

190d279c-4698-4753-b6e1-12b726bc0e29-1
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.520
after that.

804773eb-d88a-46d7-9c9e-6e2663231f13-0
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.200
So please do not drink anything else after that.

eeeae9e4-9d69-40a1-9803-b5a8a859f9af-0
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.796
Water with a squeeze of lime or lemon is fine, but don't drink

eeeae9e4-9d69-40a1-9803-b5a8a859f9af-1
00:31:31.796 --> 00:31:34.490
anything else that could sit in a stomach.

3a690d31-6a2e-4b4a-8655-fe88a49d0bda-0
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.427
Because if even you have tea or coffee or milk, there's a

3a690d31-6a2e-4b4a-8655-fe88a49d0bda-1
00:31:38.427 --> 00:31:42.588
possibility that you will sit in a stomach for 1 1/2 hours before

3a690d31-6a2e-4b4a-8655-fe88a49d0bda-2
00:31:42.588 --> 00:31:43.850
you do the practice.

46c8d58e-144a-45a2-bb58-c4a6c77f61c6-0
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:49.177
The stomach should be empty, everything should be out, and so

46c8d58e-144a-45a2-bb58-c4a6c77f61c6-1
00:31:49.177 --> 00:31:54.552
attempting to practice with any food in a stomach or with a full

46c8d58e-144a-45a2-bb58-c4a6c77f61c6-2
00:31:54.552 --> 00:31:57.860
stomach can cause damage to the system.

756c5ef4-ec94-46d9-87a3-40579fb41d21-0
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.771
So just make sure that you're always on empty stomach before

756c5ef4-ec94-46d9-87a3-40579fb41d21-1
00:32:01.771 --> 00:32:05.263
you do the practice tomorrow when you come for the session,

756c5ef4-ec94-46d9-87a3-40579fb41d21-2
00:32:05.263 --> 00:32:08.523
we'll be starting with the practices, so make sure that

756c5ef4-ec94-46d9-87a3-40579fb41d21-3
00:32:08.523 --> 00:32:11.259
you're on an empty stomach before the session.

166c2d66-c3cb-4517-b3f4-825700e7b257-0
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.567
If you feel very hungry, you can have half a glass of water

166c2d66-c3cb-4517-b3f4-825700e7b257-1
00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:20.260
before the session start or a mildly lace honey water.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.426
But do not drink so much water that you have to run out to use

a12d23c2-c49b-4f49-a59b-5561f933f2f8-1
00:32:24.426 --> 00:32:25.090
the restroom.

ea28975d-fc5c-44d5-af51-dc94e73c2d2a-0
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.930
It is best not to take a break in between the sessions so you

ea28975d-fc5c-44d5-af51-dc94e73c2d2a-1
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:31.850
consume only what is necessary.

7f97bb76-a005-4dc3-8f32-0d439ef37ed5-0
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:39.199
The next thing is in this program you'll be learning

7f97bb76-a005-4dc3-8f32-0d439ef37ed5-1
00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:41.490
Shambhavi Mahabudra Kriya.

7c342221-188d-43e9-a469-09ef56992f83-0
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:46.930
You'll be required to do the practices for the next 40 days.

a488eda7-10fb-4d91-8a86-81eee120b080-0
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.410
This practice must happen twice a day.

e6de17e5-116b-4f5e-8f58-5632ab4fbefe-0
00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.700
40 days is held as a Mandela.

8479480b-6979-4f26-9557-dd26091a4018-0
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.290
In 40 to 48 days, your system go through a certain physiological

8479480b-6979-4f26-9557-dd26091a4018-1
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.740
cycle, which is referred to as a Mandela.

7bcfef64-b17d-40f9-a5eb-86c5301db691-0
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.407
So if you introduce anything new to the system for it to take

7bcfef64-b17d-40f9-a5eb-86c5301db691-1
00:33:04.407 --> 00:33:07.340
roots into the system, it takes
40 to 48 days.

4cab34d4-0ef1-460a-82ad-bdbb8480f33e-0
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.346
So for a minimum of 40 days, you have to do these practices twice

4cab34d4-0ef1-460a-82ad-bdbb8480f33e-1
00:33:12.346 --> 00:33:12.740
a day.

d68817b0-5b37-46f0-8c02-d50d4162bf50-0
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.020
Can we start with this commitment?

41024b19-4681-41d4-92ab-ee239e2e8169-0
00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:16.820
Yes.

e9daafe5-f3af-4fc3-94c7-755dc574a2a5-0
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.622
Now, for the next six months, you have to do the practices at

e9daafe5-f3af-4fc3-94c7-755dc574a2a5-1
00:33:23.622 --> 00:33:24.690
least once a day.

28725eac-a87a-44e6-8355-221ceb1bee39-0
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:27.970
Not necessarily once a day, but at least once a day.

20312883-9356-44ff-bb86-9ae2748e41e1-0
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.330
Why six months?

788126d1-1a1c-4a29-b50e-615e5acb2ef9-0
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.450
Did all of you brush your teeth this morning?

b0950820-dcbe-4e9d-b8f3-848ca15b1e47-0
00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:41.402
Some of you are doing this, some of you are doing this, and some

b0950820-dcbe-4e9d-b8f3-848ca15b1e47-1
00:33:41.402 --> 00:33:43.410
of you are even doing this.

6df31f1e-1db0-4a76-8421-e1bfb07e7985-0
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.690
Did you brush your teeth this morning?

412fa067-3506-42f4-a16f-49bdaad1dbec-0
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:49.820
Yes.

54d95355-ac0c-4a8a-b9f3-8eec57055bc9-0
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.580
That is wonderful.

a1cd0774-c604-48e7-a97c-2a321deda373-0
00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:59.380
Did anybody, your husband, wife, parents has to ask you to do it?

d7504da0-6d26-449b-b3ab-8ab9c6c2391c-0
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.780
No, isn't it?

5ea819ed-8d02-4cc1-bc05-1e88fa45045f-0
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.420
That is very nice of you.

3d0a54e0-4908-4b16-8777-6b18228a7850-0
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.875
Or did you take an oath last night that tomorrow morning you

3d0a54e0-4908-4b16-8777-6b18228a7850-1
00:34:10.875 --> 00:34:12.540
will brush your teeth?

fdd7b791-8a62-4d11-bd63-ef2bf1ce5864-0
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.420
Did you do that?

30f613eb-23cc-4aa8-b02d-54f0e5779d53-0
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.180
No.

a8baa75a-de00-4bb0-b90c-fc0797baf7cd-0
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:15.540
Isn't it?

f16ec795-88e7-49c7-962d-167a69c12233-0
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.128
But you remember there was a time in your life when you're

f16ec795-88e7-49c7-962d-167a69c12233-1
00:34:20.128 --> 00:34:20.540
like this.

2b37cc12-b41a-4c8b-b68b-a17183078c55-0
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.380
Somebody have to tell you.

ac3bfd01-c98d-4b06-a281-1d9e0c36a53f-0
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.260
You must brush your teeth.

ca6d067e-a127-421c-9b87-eb4ea19796ee-0
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.820
No brushing, no breakfast.

e4c37c61-d3ba-48ea-b0dd-368ee8488ff7-0
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.140
They told you this isn't it?

4ed35f54-afec-4f98-a23f-b0f1ab4dadc4-0
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:30.860
For how long?

884c99c4-43b8-46c0-91ea-94ae1b70a95e-0
00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.980
Maybe for six months or a year?

06240e1d-f37d-4d20-a268-7252bdb750b9-0
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.180
They put a pressure on you.

0b01e65e-c1fc-4ec7-b10b-1d5cd476616e-0
00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.060
And after that you continue brushing on your own.

07b5148c-9a9e-4de6-84af-6d09645aefe5-0
00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.346
And you've been brushing your teeth for so many years on your

07b5148c-9a9e-4de6-84af-6d09645aefe5-1
00:34:44.346 --> 00:34:44.540
own.

0f320451-09b2-4561-a1bb-af80f569ddcb-0
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:46.700
Why?

5b1366f3-2ad0-4a9a-a676-85ff5d4c7ed1-0
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.920
Because you understood the significance of brushing your

5b1366f3-2ad0-4a9a-a676-85ff5d4c7ed1-1
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.710
teeth, isn't it?

34b8ebc6-e171-4600-bec4-ccb2c84f2f5e-0
00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:57.628
Suppose now your mother who taught you how to brush your

34b8ebc6-e171-4600-bec4-ccb2c84f2f5e-1
00:34:57.628 --> 00:34:59.190
teeth many years ago.

3cafd8bc-411b-4db1-af70-6db261b0b3e9-0
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:04.110
If she came and told you forget this brushing business.

58c5c0d8-05fe-46b9-ac87-72ec0386dcc3-0
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.230
It is no good.

0963b49f-0270-4495-8f32-90e99c7cde13-0
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.150
I've given it.

cf8d1a93-1d6c-4127-9903-431b296bbc9d-0
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.110
I've given it up.

f5e18875-4fd8-40c0-b469-898ed7858801-0
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.790
You should also give it up.

78e0c5ce-f53e-4746-b886-ca9496d59af3-0
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.950
Will you give it up?

e9427124-c35a-47e9-84d0-e5355d6f861d-0
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.830
Will you?

d7504f9a-4be6-40fe-a8cb-75b6bcca964b-0
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:13.110
No.

e123185a-cf08-4e96-9f43-adf082660e59-0
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:13.550
Isn't it?

f7ffdfc6-f34d-46d0-8839-3b3a7d29364f-0
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.482
Because you know the significance of brushing your

f7ffdfc6-f34d-46d0-8839-3b3a7d29364f-1
00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:20.000
teeth experiencingly, you know it's important.

9e509b28-1c18-4789-8edb-baf9b7381be2-0
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.852
If somebody takes away your toothbrush or toothpaste, you

9e509b28-1c18-4789-8edb-baf9b7381be2-1
00:35:23.852 --> 00:35:27.400
will still somehow find a way to brush your teeth, isn't it?

c8af4ced-ba7f-42d9-90c4-b885a00acfe1-0
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.320
So you know the importance of brushing your teeth.

f0af5901-4fa9-458f-8bf6-0ed6510d16f2-0
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.800
Similarly with this creas.

fad25c1f-f841-482f-9b1b-4b243c071098-0
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.319
So until you know the significance, until you

fad25c1f-f841-482f-9b1b-4b243c071098-1
00:35:39.319 --> 00:35:43.415
experience the significance, somebody has to set the rule for

fad25c1f-f841-482f-9b1b-4b243c071098-2
00:35:43.415 --> 00:35:43.680
you.

e50af971-6332-4617-82e8-1cfdc83cb3d8-0
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.280
So you have to do it for six months.

05db4be4-d4e5-4ec7-ba36-9247c614ecb5-0
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.378
If you do this then after six months you will anyway realise

05db4be4-d4e5-4ec7-ba36-9247c614ecb5-1
00:35:50.378 --> 00:35:53.470
the significance of it and you will keep it up anyway.

7b4bef13-fb6f-43a8-aa46-9c780aebd0f3-0
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.573
So this Korea, it's like an internal pansing or internal

7b4bef13-fb6f-43a8-aa46-9c780aebd0f3-1
00:35:58.573 --> 00:35:58.870
bath.

de75d412-213a-4bf7-a76a-25183484e1d7-0
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.030
You say all of you are saying that you have a bath everyday,

de75d412-213a-4bf7-a76a-25183484e1d7-1
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.968
but it is not true because you're only washing the very

de75d412-213a-4bf7-a76a-25183484e1d7-2
00:36:05.968 --> 00:36:07.070
surface of your skin.

2f42f77b-40bf-4d40-b1c7-3ef675c00bc7-0
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.335
If you wash the very surface of your skin once or twice a day,

2f42f77b-40bf-4d40-b1c7-3ef675c00bc7-1
00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:13.350
there isn't much dirt on the skin.

f37a5873-8e38-4d95-861f-86f2047d7327-0
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:18.074
In spite of that, if you don't have a bath for two days, how do

f37a5873-8e38-4d95-861f-86f2047d7327-1
00:36:18.074 --> 00:36:18.660
you feel?

e0a24319-0b73-447c-916e-1657de5bdfb3-0
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.660
Even if I don't eat first, I must have a bath, isn't it?

19a8536c-fc93-46d4-9527-74544e750322-0
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.747
Wouldn't it feel like this because you're having a bath

19a8536c-fc93-46d4-9527-74544e750322-1
00:36:27.747 --> 00:36:28.420
every day?

a3e3990c-666b-4301-b234-58f3e561580c-0
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.620
One day, if you missed it, you know the difference.

6d2dc56a-449e-4f6d-8ffb-8c515b143801-0
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.904
Somebody would have never had a bath in their life, will not

6d2dc56a-449e-4f6d-8ffb-8c515b143801-1
00:36:35.904 --> 00:36:37.060
know the difference.

61108bd4-18d3-414e-b368-a076deffb698-0
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.136
The same with this practices, with this career because you

61108bd4-18d3-414e-b368-a076deffb698-1
00:36:41.136 --> 00:36:42.580
have never done it before.

06d563ca-bffc-4fcc-945c-051ad9b3dcfa-0
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.980
You don't know the difference.

a3fa1e6f-6a87-4929-87f4-e8c4b0d8efac-0
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.540
So this is an internal cleansing that you have to do to realize

a3fa1e6f-6a87-4929-87f4-e8c4b0d8efac-1
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.250
the significance of what it is.

257acc0c-9357-4cf6-9eb8-5955359d5be4-0
00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.370
It will take a certain period of time.

4d16e134-0e9d-4228-9882-440ac30122e6-0
00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:58.256
So let's say after two years of time if I come back and tell you

4d16e134-0e9d-4228-9882-440ac30122e6-1
00:36:58.256 --> 00:37:00.810
forget this Shamba V, it is no good.

ddb28a22-110a-46db-b9db-362d144fbfb7-0
00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:02.450
It was a mistake that I told you.

fed78816-4790-40e5-ab5c-11ceb486b87f-0
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.909
If I that I told you this, you will not give it up because by

fed78816-4790-40e5-ab5c-11ceb486b87f-1
00:37:05.909 --> 00:37:08.690
then you know how significance it is in your life.

44326377-2055-42f5-8efb-2692c0382ac7-0
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.234
But before realizing the significance of it, very easily

44326377-2055-42f5-8efb-2692c0382ac7-1
00:37:13.234 --> 00:37:14.330
you can drop it.

eaf1dd5d-f631-4d85-a11c-d23e0d5cca2b-0
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:20.770
So can we commit with this that you'll do this for six months?

ec0ad9f5-3e71-4eb5-b906-2092cd559678-0
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:22.370
Yes.

de92e656-bd5b-42c9-831b-0e68d3ee6d8f-0
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.450
The next thing is there is no notes taking here.

22e1a6d5-1678-4966-9e22-0944a660f761-0
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.410
This is experiential.

ecec6b33-c448-4d43-b7ec-e1c0b4d372bd-0
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.850
If you convert it into knowledge, it will not work.

4e421c8b-ae01-4d87-8ca9-048b1357b131-0
00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.934
It is not to be understood, it has to be perceived and received

4e421c8b-ae01-4d87-8ca9-048b1357b131-1
00:37:37.934 --> 00:37:41.650
in a certain way because it is a subjective dimension.

bc590e4b-f8c3-4902-8ca4-06e626196888-0
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.400
So you just have to be here and be alert.

d83f462e-843e-400e-abeb-ca34ddb13698-0
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.040
Writing down is not needed.

b6f12615-a382-4c37-b225-0fe298efb7cf-0
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.469
So don't worry about the instructions, just be here and

b6f12615-a382-4c37-b225-0fe298efb7cf-1
00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:54.880
be with the process.

e2d0f536-efaa-4655-b250-574955bd9610-0
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.179
We'll be reviewing the instructions sufficiently so the

e2d0f536-efaa-4655-b250-574955bd9610-1
00:37:59.179 --> 00:38:03.475
practices will be clear for you and there will be also support

e2d0f536-efaa-4655-b250-574955bd9610-2
00:38:03.475 --> 00:38:07.840
at every stage of the process so that you'll get the practices.

b79415cc-526c-4ba8-8ffd-ee2de15b1a6e-0
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:08.880
Is it OK?

1b44d90c-8918-44aa-af33-e410ecbd6c03-0
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.247
And please do not record any aspects of the program or share

1b44d90c-8918-44aa-af33-e410ecbd6c03-1
00:38:15.247 --> 00:38:17.980
the content of the program with anyone.

6efc1705-a0b6-4986-b04b-508dd677821a-0
00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.734
It is important that a process of this death has to be received

6efc1705-a0b6-4986-b04b-508dd677821a-1
00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.300
from the right source.

8cd09b4d-46e1-445f-b72a-1dc0c8524c3b-0
00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.887
Anyone who wishes to receive Shambhavi Mahamudra should

8cd09b4d-46e1-445f-b72a-1dc0c8524c3b-1
00:38:28.887 --> 00:38:29.940
receive it properly.

92649552-b13b-40d0-8195-d1cd4bc3718c-0
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.332
If you share a video or the content, then you could have

92649552-b13b-40d0-8195-d1cd4bc3718c-1
00:38:35.332 --> 00:38:37.980
destroyed the possibility for them.

48551156-a875-44af-8ac2-996757e082b6-0
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.740
So can we take care of this now?

978223f2-7a28-4f0a-98b0-f5a428264289-0
00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.300
These are the rules.

26161ad2-5790-4f24-a72a-29f1fb896cb6-0
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.140
Do you agree to go by these rules?

facd794d-5729-4e2f-b825-d47196aca78b-0
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:49.860
Do you?

8651ee23-aeb4-4221-82ab-ccc24c61b414-0
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.140
Once you agree to go by these rules, whose role are these?

a4733aa9-aba8-4306-98c4-4e1fcaff281e-0
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.108
Some of you might be thinking this is the program's rules, the

a4733aa9-aba8-4306-98c4-4e1fcaff281e-1
00:39:02.108 --> 00:39:04.780
teacher's rules, or is Satguru's rules.

953e8d3e-d228-473f-8210-d11ab16e8063-0
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.220
It's our rules.

a7998154-6560-41de-a41f-e128aa405260-0
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.220
These are the different possibilities for the rules.

4a750eaa-1c7d-48e3-9c92-4d8bb936b654-0
00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:18.040
Now once you agree to play a game, if you think the rules of

4a750eaa-1c7d-48e3-9c92-4d8bb936b654-1
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.740
the game is not yours, can you play that game with total

4a750eaa-1c7d-48e3-9c92-4d8bb936b654-2
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.940
involvement?

462f59e1-79aa-445d-b3c3-85ac0095fa4f-0
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.140
Can you?

40452787-06e1-4838-9c29-4ec1326e4b6a-0
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.819
Let's say tomorrow morning you want to get up, In the morning,

40452787-06e1-4838-9c29-4ec1326e4b6a-1
00:39:55.819 --> 00:39:58.550
You want to get up at 6:00 and take a walk.

dc15a331-890a-49ea-be04-11a26cc28411-0
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.990
It is your rules.

bbacc26f-0c99-4679-8c4a-a68fccd55f84-0
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:04.228
If it is your rules, then waking up in the morning and taking a

bbacc26f-0c99-4679-8c4a-a68fccd55f84-1
00:40:04.228 --> 00:40:06.950
walk can be a very exhilarating experience.

f531f64e-8481-42a8-bd53-6871de275aa2-0
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:12.991
But if it is your mother in law's rule 6:00, you have to get

f531f64e-8481-42a8-bd53-6871de275aa2-1
00:40:12.991 --> 00:40:13.630
up now.

c32964d2-97da-4caf-98f5-41012bd3d2c1-0
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:18.070
The moment the clock strikes 6, you get a headache, isn't it?

18b6487b-7a11-4f96-b80d-dedef2639176-0
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:26.710
So let's say your friends comes and say let's go for a picnic.

0b353623-bbb1-4bd0-997c-026345bb30b3-0
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.430
Be ready by 5, you're up by 4, isn't it?

463b8f1a-980b-455d-be7b-ae7e0c4eb9ab-0
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.270
So this is not about waking up, this is not about sleeping.

0b9d5516-32c3-430e-815f-895f64fab914-0
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.153
It's just that if it is somebody else's rule, it's very

0b9d5516-32c3-430e-815f-895f64fab914-1
00:40:37.153 --> 00:40:37.830
burdensome.

f11a6703-ae6f-4023-99fa-ae7c0b55b3ad-0
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:42.310
But if it's your rules, then it is different, isn't it?

e9862da8-6b53-461e-9a10-81a4b1e57a0d-0
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.110
So the rules of the games, whose rules are this?

52c58dfa-4ace-463d-a5d7-a2ec4e718785-0
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.160
Whose rules?

01e0da68-652f-46ae-9a6b-b470b5b8c8f2-0
00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.880
Our rules.

4daa5956-62c9-4744-9d77-f88ab2ac3a2d-0
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.731
Our rules means if everybody come on time tomorrow, only then

4daa5956-62c9-4744-9d77-f88ab2ac3a2d-1
00:40:56.731 --> 00:40:58.000
you'll come on time.

03d2d851-8030-4329-93da-002b1bc0d7ed-0
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.470
So what I'm asking you is nobody's going to be here on

03d2d851-8030-4329-93da-002b1bc0d7ed-1
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.160
time tomorrow.

8c1a129e-8513-4047-9cc0-cbc0f1bb4fa3-0
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.160
Will you be here?

cf95a63e-f0a9-4e18-bee5-c783e33e5c9e-0
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:04.800
Will you?

89d465a7-7621-49dd-9dfb-efdb42499d4d-0
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.160
So whose rules are this?

c1ba2503-5d5e-4c1e-81a8-3a3daf73479c-0
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.480
My rules?

5bfe6fac-217c-4eb1-b53d-da4425ca89b7-0
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.080
Yes.

37958223-cf9a-4fcb-a552-81b2288d87e9-0
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.846
If you experience your your rules as mine, then it's always

37958223-cf9a-4fcb-a552-81b2288d87e9-1
00:41:16.846 --> 00:41:19.210
a joy in fulfilling it.

4e70ba56-f94d-4e0a-9965-e57d289f9c3f-0
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:24.370
But if you think it is somebody else's, it is always a pain.

7bb28d75-c481-4438-98b4-189dbf6ed66e-0
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.603
If you see the rules are mine, then being here will be a

7bb28d75-c481-4438-98b4-189dbf6ed66e-1
00:41:29.603 --> 00:41:31.090
wonderful experience.

788369bd-d9d6-4efd-889a-36a28de48fea-0
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:35.124
But if you think this is the teacher's rules or Sadhguru's

788369bd-d9d6-4efd-889a-36a28de48fea-1
00:41:35.124 --> 00:41:38.210
rules, then you might just give yourself a headache.

af070493-33f1-44cf-87f5-73fe9a4f8499-0
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.970
Now we'll be starting with to learn the practices.

9699e2e8-0eb1-45dc-9dc4-8a6d19dc40f2-0
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.550
First, we'll be hearing from Sadhguru.

8ef7e3d2-5b1f-4028-9ca7-c3311f945f3b-0
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.714
So you can sit in adesitasana with your palms facing upwards

8ef7e3d2-5b1f-4028-9ca7-c3311f945f3b-1
00:41:51.714 --> 00:41:53.510
and keep your eyes open.

df7f7baa-08f8-47f2-93ca-9d648ceefbac-0
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:08.060
In the evolutionary scheme of things, life moving from

df7f7baa-08f8-47f2-93ca-9d648ceefbac-1
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:18.290
invertebrate to vertebrate is a very significant step.

c7905209-6232-48ed-b8ef-7948dad44523-0
00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:28.324
Why so is what a vertebrate means is you have far more

c7905209-6232-48ed-b8ef-7948dad44523-1
00:42:28.324 --> 00:42:34.210
developed and organized neurological system.

3c39dc0f-1970-49e3-ad8f-9172bf09565b-0
00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:42.467
That means the more complex the neurological system is, more

3c39dc0f-1970-49e3-ad8f-9172bf09565b-1
00:42:42.467 --> 00:42:48.183
capable you are of higher level of experience or more

3c39dc0f-1970-49e3-ad8f-9172bf09565b-2
00:42:48.183 --> 00:42:52.100
sophisticated nuances of experience.

eb37db02-7d73-434e-93a5-fd0652fbd817-0
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.603
So from invertebrate to vertebrate was one significant

eb37db02-7d73-434e-93a5-fd0652fbd817-1
00:42:59.603 --> 00:42:59.900
step.

9b14143a-98fa-4f25-a154-ab3ea2517e1e-0
00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:05.387
The next significant step in the evolutionary scheme was from a

9b14143a-98fa-4f25-a154-ab3ea2517e1e-1
00:43:05.387 --> 00:43:08.100
horizontal spine to a vertical spine.

fe776dce-e670-451e-81d4-ae0e9f6def76-0
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.707
It is only after the spine became vertical, the brain, the

fe776dce-e670-451e-81d4-ae0e9f6def76-1
00:43:14.707 --> 00:43:18.700
cerebral cortex, developed the way it has today.

d460ea25-e877-45a5-b3c5-3012d5d87530-0
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:30.629
An erect spine is an important part of how your intelligence

d460ea25-e877-45a5-b3c5-3012d5d87530-1
00:43:30.629 --> 00:43:33.420
and perception functions.

c4ac50a4-4d58-4c2d-bce6-f331457b77e5-0
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:40.580
In yoga, tremendous importance is laid upon your spine.

72be0642-9ee1-4fda-b8bb-951c2f37e2ca-0
00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.390
Spine is known as the Merudhanda.

6f154cbf-3ed2-4b00-8341-11e54122f93a-0
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.710
Merudhanda means the axis of the universe.

ba3dd986-1ba3-4fb6-893d-1a4ed710b3c4-0
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.270
Chathguru Already my spine is.

78fd9314-f445-46bd-9274-ec07660f1d57-0
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.590
My spine is in pain.

3f5d55c0-9f77-47ea-b68f-0bf4a45280be-0
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.750
If it becomes the axis of the universe, what will happen?

4723e803-1c1a-4eef-ba15-4658a8697d5d-0
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.550
Why is it the axis of the universe?

6e9511c6-043d-46cd-8646-4e4a18cf9631-0
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.870
Or why is it being referred to this way?

7a9c2e42-2420-470f-a9e1-b544f9ea59ae-0
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:17.400
Is universe exists for you the way it exists for you?

1dffd058-cc09-49d7-81c8-b4017a85ae19-0
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:22.676
Only because of the way you experience it, the way it's

1dffd058-cc09-49d7-81c8-b4017a85ae19-1
00:44:22.676 --> 00:44:25.160
projected in your perception.

816e196a-0d44-4587-aaf8-bc336558144a-0
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.920
That is how you know it.

8137c47b-888e-4d2a-9b89-0e1752b3c097-0
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.360
You do not know how a bird is experiencing the universe.

f4a0a3da-b32e-40f4-ad1f-c0d9aaa2b8ff-0
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.360
You do not know how an insect is experiencing the universe.

26d095a0-254b-4031-83a6-8f4048dd52ef-0
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.440
You do not know how an earthworm is experiencing the universe.

d4372126-76f8-4ea9-94ae-c814f8bc1ec9-0
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.860
You only know it the way it's projected within you.

b617a287-17e8-480b-aa28-54a1be07d30d-0
00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:50.300
And this experience is mainly conducted through your spine.

f75c901f-a174-470c-a921-5d578df03074-0
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.953
If we cut one wire passing through your spine, you will

f75c901f-a174-470c-a921-5d578df03074-1
00:44:55.953 --> 00:44:58.420
have no experience of even the body.

c2a618e0-4dd4-4a93-b373-a717bf7a5584-0
00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:04.697
Forget about the universe because spine is conducting the

c2a618e0-4dd4-4a93-b373-a717bf7a5584-1
00:45:04.697 --> 00:45:10.974
whole experience of life, and universe exists for us only

c2a618e0-4dd4-4a93-b373-a717bf7a5584-2
00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:16.170
because of what is happening through the spine.

bcf10f0a-7d3d-41fe-98dd-8cb4bc9f76ce-0
00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.713
This is known as the axis of the universe because this is the

bcf10f0a-7d3d-41fe-98dd-8cb4bc9f76ce-1
00:45:23.713 --> 00:45:25.530
basis of your experience.

ea875ad2-2e6b-42bb-969e-5b17a9181373-0
00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.450
Axis also means the center.

d557d571-537c-4a07-9bc9-bdaaffd071a7-0
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.970
How can my spine be the center of the universe?

8c110911-154d-43ac-a286-1a69f3e9be3f-0
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:42.322
See if we are debating about which is the center of this

8c110911-154d-43ac-a286-1a69f3e9be3f-1
00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:42.690
hall.

4ba1e64d-f5f6-4db7-a900-e09dce9cc82c-0
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.041
Someone can say it's there, someone can say it's here,

4ba1e64d-f5f6-4db7-a900-e09dce9cc82c-1
00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:49.970
someone can say it is somewhere else.

e0b8bc5f-0a32-4392-a1dd-f8a63c226c01-0
00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:58.419
We can debate about this because we know the boundary of the

e0b8bc5f-0a32-4392-a1dd-f8a63c226c01-1
00:45:58.419 --> 00:45:58.850
hall.

91d1c488-c856-493b-9e03-633d657eabf1-0
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:05.890
Because there is a boundary, we could arrive at a center.

ed088437-4e4b-4f3d-9546-1ea530aecc4e-0
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.210
Suppose there is no boundary.

9fb891fe-538c-4ca8-8ff4-b0722de31b83-0
00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:17.142
As far as you're concerned, there is no boundary to the

9fb891fe-538c-4ca8-8ff4-b0722de31b83-1
00:46:17.142 --> 00:46:20.850
universe where there is no boundary.

35e154bf-81be-4a67-9537-b990dc63685d-0
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.538
Wherever you create a certain intensity of experience, that is

35e154bf-81be-4a67-9537-b990dc63685d-1
00:46:25.538 --> 00:46:26.210
the center.

2798c3c6-c25b-42cb-9e50-5b14e7ad8c8f-0
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:36.152
When there is no boundary to the universe, if you wish, if you

2798c3c6-c25b-42cb-9e50-5b14e7ad8c8f-1
00:46:36.152 --> 00:46:42.410
make very effervescent spine, if you create a very intensely

2798c3c6-c25b-42cb-9e50-5b14e7ad8c8f-2
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:48.770
active, perceptive spine, you are the center of the universe.

7418925d-fca7-40a1-9daa-9791fcfc7326-0
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:54.773
So keeping the spine in a good condition, when I say good

7418925d-fca7-40a1-9daa-9791fcfc7326-1
00:46:54.773 --> 00:46:59.447
condition, not only physically well but energetically active

7418925d-fca7-40a1-9daa-9791fcfc7326-2
00:46:59.447 --> 00:47:04.426
and alive, is an important part of enhancing one's experience of

7418925d-fca7-40a1-9daa-9791fcfc7326-3
00:47:04.426 --> 00:47:04.810
life.

caf582cc-eac5-4f9f-a56f-132feb0e7f83-0
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:15.631
The most significant aspect of distinction between the other

caf582cc-eac5-4f9f-a56f-132feb0e7f83-1
00:47:15.631 --> 00:47:21.436
creatures who live on this planet and yourself is there is

caf582cc-eac5-4f9f-a56f-132feb0e7f83-2
00:47:21.436 --> 00:47:27.831
a cerebral cortex which is able to think and project and imagine

caf582cc-eac5-4f9f-a56f-132feb0e7f83-3
00:47:27.831 --> 00:47:29.110
and remember.

3878e4f3-8c60-4dbc-beb6-b045683b2ef9-0
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:34.740
In a certain way, Sadhguru, memory is already there.

16cda2f7-36c6-47b0-9572-31740de76ffb-0
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:41.733
But the ability to take this memory out and use it the way we

16cda2f7-36c6-47b0-9572-31740de76ffb-1
00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:47.487
want it, no other creature on this planet has that ability as

16cda2f7-36c6-47b0-9572-31740de76ffb-2
00:47:47.487 --> 00:47:49.900
good as a human being has.

f98b946d-152e-426f-bc0d-f985b6518a7f-0
00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:55.303
Mainly because this part of the brain, which is a new happening

f98b946d-152e-426f-bc0d-f985b6518a7f-1
00:47:55.303 --> 00:47:59.990
on this planet, one of the most recent developments in the

f98b946d-152e-426f-bc0d-f985b6518a7f-2
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:04.200
evolutionary scale of things is the cerebral cortex.

d175f518-4f39-4059-a066-54eae7e4da33-0
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.385
Even within you, your brain, there is something called as a

d175f518-4f39-4059-a066-54eae7e4da33-1
00:48:09.385 --> 00:48:10.480
reptilian brain.

728f308b-e7ec-4aca-bfe3-930d51a912c3-0
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.320
You know this, hmm.

5a9cae0a-c11c-49e5-a8f5-a231cd8f3d34-0
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.240
There's a brain which is the size of a crocodile's brain.

46a0dfbf-9ebb-4279-ad1d-47dc7359930c-0
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.515
So you know how many times you feel like biting somebody's head

46a0dfbf-9ebb-4279-ad1d-47dc7359930c-1
00:48:21.515 --> 00:48:21.760
off?

cea72cd7-3f52-468a-8907-dbd4bb4d8412-0
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:29.370
TCH, that instinct is coming from there, sadhguru.

2c72537e-d342-4abe-a14f-eeea0f425187-0
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:33.740
Now it is this cerebral cortex which sets you apart as a human

2c72537e-d342-4abe-a14f-eeea0f425187-1
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:37.210
being, distinctly different from other creatures.

c7c72d4f-aa7c-451f-804a-f81cb88e7c4c-0
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:44.412
For this brain to flower, the most important thing was the

c7c72d4f-aa7c-451f-804a-f81cb88e7c4c-1
00:48:44.412 --> 00:48:45.890
spine became vertical.

a574c02a-00b0-405b-aff1-9479070cd2c1-0
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.210
That is why it flowered like this.

104be064-c063-41d3-83c6-50f70e5e3511-0
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:55.780
If you want flowers in your garden, you don't go and

104be064-c063-41d3-83c6-50f70e5e3511-1
00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:00.930
fertilize the flower, You only nurture the root.

28566f26-14a6-4d99-82ed-a601c018055c-0
00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.250
If you nurture the root, flower and fruit will happen.

9b5cab30-1ad1-43a2-88b6-68a6251679e5-0
00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:10.187
So there's a whole system of yoga about nurturing the root of

9b5cab30-1ad1-43a2-88b6-68a6251679e5-1
00:49:10.187 --> 00:49:10.810
the spine.

118744a6-369f-47d0-b74c-9c7dcf728c45-0
00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:16.708
We will do a couple of simple processes which all of you will

118744a6-369f-47d0-b74c-9c7dcf728c45-1
00:49:16.708 --> 00:49:20.530
be able to do to activate the base of your spine.

e4691caf-d6d9-4a9a-9af6-e57c4bc36925-0
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:27.130
Sadhguru.

eea25f56-ca24-4674-a340-f13a6a3854fa-0
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.770
The first proper asana they will learn is called Patangasana.

abb29cf5-ffac-4604-9a10-4a52d0ba3c26-0
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.490
Patanga means butterfly.

f755939e-1002-4cfa-8cd9-c416963e01d1-0
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:37.843
If you do this asana, the very base of your spine will be

f755939e-1002-4cfa-8cd9-c416963e01d1-1
00:49:37.843 --> 00:49:39.410
cultivated and activated.

54d42f9e-3e56-47bc-8206-c3697922b410-0
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.821
If you activate the very base of your spine, the development and

54d42f9e-3e56-47bc-8206-c3697922b410-1
00:49:43.821 --> 00:49:47.610
the activity of the brain can be greatly controlled and enhanced.

61163964-25be-4c60-bfce-b7450300ff55-0
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:52.236
As we go through this process, one aspect of what we're doing

61163964-25be-4c60-bfce-b7450300ff55-1
00:49:52.236 --> 00:49:55.130
is to activate the lower part of your spine.

7ed8dbd6-d26c-4cef-861c-ab583326272a-0
00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:00.165
Another aspect is to loosen up your limbs in such a way that

7ed8dbd6-d26c-4cef-861c-ab583326272a-1
00:50:00.165 --> 00:50:03.740
you can sit comfortably on a cross legged posture.

74416c1b-7520-4e31-9035-748ae58d89aa-0
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.940
So now we'll look at the instruction for Patangasana.

a30193e1-4f6b-4c93-95a8-3d303379af35-0
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.260
We'll see the demonstration first.

241ebf46-0b2b-4f53-898a-3dcd50a965cf-0
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.540
So please, just observe.

6b8f7b3c-e042-423e-986b-033824ae5254-0
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.340
Don't do it yet.

4ab451c3-c775-442d-a1e2-db572b828944-0
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.260
Just observe.

621a08e3-2b9a-4907-87b6-1654b0d25d67-0
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.716
So how you do this is put the soles of your feet together,

621a08e3-2b9a-4907-87b6-1654b0d25d67-1
00:51:16.716 --> 00:51:19.220
clasp your hands over your toes.

6f2afdf1-d35e-4618-ad01-f968ffb7bdfd-0
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:20.980
close your eyes.

7b1da512-aa4e-4427-ad8e-cc31eb2a3816-0
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.735
Pull your heels as close to you as possible, and a little more

7b1da512-aa4e-4427-ad8e-cc31eb2a3816-1
00:51:26.735 --> 00:51:27.740
and wing it.

17b760f1-2124-4a81-8a7d-00ece318af5b-0
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.940
Keep your spine erect.

27eb83d3-5d16-45b1-b534-1c9319887b2b-0
00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.100
Get maximum movement.

ff9a24fa-12c8-4ea2-8f25-3b78b69c1036-0
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.100
The breathing is slightly deeper than normal.

1abfcd53-b459-4c13-b63d-3bc74e296876-0
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:41.975
You do this for two minutes and you should notice the maximum

1abfcd53-b459-4c13-b63d-3bc74e296876-1
00:51:41.975 --> 00:51:44.840
pressure at the base of the spine.

014c2cce-1fba-495a-9aad-08cc032c5530-0
00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.480
Then relax.

4eff2729-2ed6-4f14-96f8-3c1cd84b1f14-0
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:03.024
Now we'll do this together with along with the instructions, so

4eff2729-2ed6-4f14-96f8-3c1cd84b1f14-1
00:52:03.024 --> 00:52:07.469
please make sure that you are on an empty stomach before you

4eff2729-2ed6-4f14-96f8-3c1cd84b1f14-2
00:52:07.469 --> 00:52:09.000
attempt the practice.

8c948c77-e4b9-4a55-a65f-861a81f006ac-0
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.749
You have any injury which prevent you from doing the

8c948c77-e4b9-4a55-a65f-861a81f006ac-1
00:52:13.749 --> 00:52:17.826
practice or if you are not on an empty stomach condition right

8c948c77-e4b9-4a55-a65f-861a81f006ac-2
00:52:17.826 --> 00:52:21.449
now, you can sit with your eyes closed for during this.

d9f1d54a-5fb2-44bf-a111-1c8f10a9f113-0
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:26.600
And we'll guide you on what are the alternative for this towards

d9f1d54a-5fb2-44bf-a111-1c8f10a9f113-1
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.210
the end of the sessions for ladies.

948cbc1d-9b7c-45f8-bdbb-882af2e63b64-0
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.491
And for ladies, during pregnancy or menstrual cycles, you still

948cbc1d-9b7c-45f8-bdbb-882af2e63b64-1
00:52:33.491 --> 00:52:37.474
can do this practice to whatever extent that you can, there's no

948cbc1d-9b7c-45f8-bdbb-882af2e63b64-2
00:52:37.474 --> 00:52:38.209
restriction.

23adbc1f-81e5-4111-945e-a2e56573f1ff-0
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:44.320
And in case you're unsure if you can do this practice, you can

23adbc1f-81e5-4111-945e-a2e56573f1ff-1
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.396
check with the doctor before doing so and discontinue if you

23adbc1f-81e5-4111-945e-a2e56573f1ff-2
00:52:48.396 --> 00:52:51.070
experience a severe discomfort or pain.

e99583d0-028c-44cb-a822-abc996d2082a-0
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:56.320
You can adjust your position right now so you're fully

e99583d0-028c-44cb-a822-abc996d2082a-1
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.710

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:32.751
The Pranamaya Kosha are the energy body comprises of 72,000

6ceace92-e413-433d-86d8-e7c9915b856d-1
01:12:32.751 --> 01:12:33.260
nadis.

7e2a322d-fc97-40be-94e0-17d1ae8fdc12-0
01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:38.161
These 72,000 nadis are fundamentally springing from 2

7e2a322d-fc97-40be-94e0-17d1ae8fdc12-1
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:39.100
basic nadis.

d5963699-c508-499c-800b-1d264ae39b5d-0
01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:44.525
The right is called Pingala, the left is called EDA from EDA from

d5963699-c508-499c-800b-1d264ae39b5d-1
01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:46.460
Pingala, 36,000 from EDA.

50338ff9-4da3-46c0-b1cb-c06f08dea59a-0
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:51.260
As there is a physical body, there is an energy body.

e05b3185-72c9-4f22-b149-a4b3288b0f7b-0
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:58.450
Annamaya Kosha, Anomaya Kosha, Pranamaya Kosha.

dc87b0e9-f5f6-426b-8abb-589f46b5b65c-0
01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:03.660
The Pranamaya Kosha are the energy body comprises of 72,000

dc87b0e9-f5f6-426b-8abb-589f46b5b65c-1
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:04.170
Nadis.

1bb59541-5364-49b2-8bee-b0fdf2b7479a-0
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:09.111
These 72,000 Nadis are fundamentally springing from 2

1bb59541-5364-49b2-8bee-b0fdf2b7479a-1
01:13:09.111 --> 01:13:10.050
basic Nadis.

f306a3af-fb5b-4522-80b4-6f63ccf3c634-0
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:11.970
The right is called Pingala.

8248b9ba-58af-4001-9590-e57debfb1538-0
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:18.027
The left is called EDA from EDA from Pingala 36,000 from EDA

8248b9ba-58af-4001-9590-e57debfb1538-1
01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:19.250
36,000 Nadis.

a3ea9142-2d0a-45e0-b049-bf45310ef733-0
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:22.770
When I say a Nadi, we are not talking about nerves.

a6b720e3-26ea-4e23-b9cb-7ee323f9df67-0
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:26.130
These are the channels or pathways prana.

f89e022e-ad39-40ef-aede-672fe69b0a40-0
01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:30.730
If you cut this body and look you will not find any nadis.

d68ab072-1c8c-4442-bf0e-f4f0305500d6-0
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:35.418
But if you close your eyes and experience this you will see

d68ab072-1c8c-4442-bf0e-f4f0305500d6-1
01:13:35.418 --> 01:13:37.770
energy is never moving randomly.

0bf26bdc-8340-40f2-8910-15a3a00b20ae-0
01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:40.770
It is always moving in established pathways.

4b77b896-6032-4b13-8ce3-f165a9262d87-0
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:41.490
Always.

b2e46a13-49d6-467e-8596-c0f83a5ed072-0
01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:45.610
So there are 72,000 ways in which it is moving.

063b4b31-cd9e-48fe-b627-e6414a9968f3-0
01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:52.119
This 72,000 is a manifestation which has happened from 2 basic

063b4b31-cd9e-48fe-b627-e6414a9968f3-1
01:13:52.119 --> 01:13:55.020
Nadis, Pingala and EDA Sadhguru.

be859da1-7e47-4da3-b307-9730ee250614-0
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.060
This Eida and Pingala are also symbolized as Sun and moon.

2b22ec2f-16de-4a8b-8d3e-92e6ba546552-0
01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.900
The word Hata.

0e54f9f0-6d4c-4475-b06a-21ee74aa8ac9-0
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.260
You've heard of Hata Yoga?

11751809-0f77-4b8c-89e9-1e70d8ec004e-0
01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.340
Hmm not hot Yoga.

285afc99-5857-4573-92b9-b0d0f0ef621f-0
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.220
Hata Yoga.

07539364-dc27-40d3-bfac-1152b9e565bf-0
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:16.340
So this Eida and Pingala are two dimensions of your energy which

07539364-dc27-40d3-bfac-1152b9e565bf-1
01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.180
is called ha and TA Ha.

2794d99a-5710-477c-80bd-5430180f7754-0
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.220
TA means Sun and moon.

ecf76caf-c93d-4d2d-a177-42f9d7014fc6-0
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.940
Hata Yoga means to bring a balance between sun and moon.

97da645c-e932-4233-9b4b-924c9501816e-0
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:26.770
Why is sun and moon within me?

bf799165-5d60-4a03-afd0-4465736ca9b2-0
01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:31.966
You must understand your body is just a product of this solar

bf799165-5d60-4a03-afd0-4465736ca9b2-1
01:14:31.966 --> 01:14:32.490
system.

ce27ad15-6c58-4c92-a786-8f7442d77c8d-0
01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:38.140
Solar system is functioning like a Potter's wheel to churn up

ce27ad15-6c58-4c92-a786-8f7442d77c8d-1
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:38.890
this body.

5a02ac52-0381-4695-87be-3fefc639854a-0
01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:43.823
If the solar system function differently, your body will take

5a02ac52-0381-4695-87be-3fefc639854a-1
01:14:43.823 --> 01:14:45.650
on a different form altogether.

e3f39b08-529e-4d00-87d6-e29ea4f9c08f-0
01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:51.464
So this is a part which just evolved like this because the

e3f39b08-529e-4d00-87d6-e29ea4f9c08f-1
01:14:51.464 --> 01:14:54.720
solar system is functioning in a certain way.

79549fdc-234a-468c-b64b-3e3d5b1cdce3-0
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.222
Modern science today is just touching a few rudimentary

79549fdc-234a-468c-b64b-3e3d5b1cdce3-1
01:14:59.222 --> 01:15:00.200
aspects of this.

329fc494-0966-4c1e-935c-91366a72a9d4-0
01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.560
Over 15,000 years ago, Adiyogi spoke about this.

8cd2d26b-db57-4b7e-8b09-40b02397d1e7-0
01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:08.326
Adiyogi means the first Yogi spoke about this in great

8cd2d26b-db57-4b7e-8b09-40b02397d1e7-1
01:15:08.326 --> 01:15:08.760
detail.

adb0398e-9b46-4dc8-b23b-9d6f34478452-0
01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.154
It's very uncanny that today people are asking the same

adb0398e-9b46-4dc8-b23b-9d6f34478452-1
01:15:13.154 --> 01:15:15.280
questions and similar answers are coming.

bf4ec973-212b-40c1-b696-1f6b93cb4ed8-0
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.911
In the last 6-7 years, much research has gone into

bf4ec973-212b-40c1-b696-1f6b93cb4ed8-1
01:15:20.911 --> 01:15:25.759
neurological aspect of the human being, particularly about

bf4ec973-212b-40c1-b696-1f6b93cb4ed8-2
01:15:25.759 --> 01:15:29.539
mapping the human brain and things like that.

d8f22601-df3c-4d89-b71e-abcc996b3a01-0
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.571
So one of the questions always is people are asking can't we

d8f22601-df3c-4d89-b71e-abcc996b3a01-1
01:15:35.571 --> 01:15:39.340
grow a little bigger brain so that we could do more things.

5614e773-6ba3-42e1-ad87-c2fc2deec9cf-0
01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:45.262
How many times you felt the need with people around you, yes or

5614e773-6ba3-42e1-ad87-c2fc2deec9cf-1
01:15:45.262 --> 01:15:45.540
no?

e9049786-de99-42d9-961a-5b0d9c3e55c9-0
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.340
You only wish they had little more brain.

8e3b2c15-c977-41dc-a8a7-b3db9758191e-0
01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.220
So people ask these questions.

2d3d21a3-c433-4d7a-997f-fdc04fb6ba7d-0
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.833
So what the neurologists have come up with is because of the

2d3d21a3-c433-4d7a-997f-fdc04fb6ba7d-1
01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:59.740
physical loss, not because of neurological principles.

d1a9b24c-d770-4a73-b6a5-ece0449a5cb1-0
01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.328
Because of the physical loss, you cannot grow any bigger brain

d1a9b24c-d770-4a73-b6a5-ece0449a5cb1-1
01:16:04.328 --> 01:16:08.774
than the way you have right now, because the only way to enhance

d1a9b24c-d770-4a73-b6a5-ece0449a5cb1-2
01:16:08.774 --> 01:16:13.220
the capacity of the brain is you must pack more neurons into it.

6d2bd56e-61e3-4d3a-bd0e-acc93a2f53b4-0
01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:17.180
If you pack more neurons into it, clarity will go away.

ae4ca621-8a46-4e38-bb95-bee4d1bc5e58-0
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:19.390
Many children come with this problem.

c0086649-c78c-4e71-8b20-a5d40375b45c-0
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:21.986
They're very intelligent, but they're hopping all over the

c0086649-c78c-4e71-8b20-a5d40375b45c-1
01:16:21.986 --> 01:16:22.230
place.

c4e5cc46-260f-440b-842f-162e0b422804-0
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:23.350
No clarity.

6f984b90-1607-4630-b83a-566302496f8c-0
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:24.910
Slowly life will.

942c1f1e-cfd6-465b-b987-771465625413-0
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:28.542
If you put them through natural processes, you will see it's

942c1f1e-cfd6-465b-b987-771465625413-1
01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:30.150
being labeled as a disease.

d19d605b-f99f-49ff-8ef7-32c2d9ee7b47-0
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:34.620
It is not a disease, a small manufacturing excess, you know

d19d605b-f99f-49ff-8ef7-32c2d9ee7b47-1
01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:38.676
it's a little excess if you if you just put them through

d19d605b-f99f-49ff-8ef7-32c2d9ee7b47-2
01:16:38.676 --> 01:16:41.310
certain paces they will settle down.

5cf25fc6-3f63-409e-9d54-5c310f93e804-0
01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.429
But instead of that they're giving them medicines and

5cf25fc6-3f63-409e-9d54-5c310f93e804-1
01:16:45.429 --> 01:16:49.446
treatment and a whole industry is growing around that so-called

5cf25fc6-3f63-409e-9d54-5c310f93e804-2
01:16:49.446 --> 01:16:53.087
ADH and whatever this happened in our school, we had just

5cf25fc6-3f63-409e-9d54-5c310f93e804-3
01:16:53.087 --> 01:16:56.978
started the school at that time a few years ago and one day I

5cf25fc6-3f63-409e-9d54-5c310f93e804-4
01:16:56.978 --> 01:17:01.058
went to the morning assembly to see these kids, all 6-7 year old

5cf25fc6-3f63-409e-9d54-5c310f93e804-5
01:17:01.058 --> 01:17:05.075
kids, they're all sitting like this, like this, like this, like

5cf25fc6-3f63-409e-9d54-5c310f93e804-6
01:17:05.075 --> 01:17:06.080
this, like this.

ec01e355-ba26-43ab-8182-ed54782722dd-0
01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.120
I said why are these children like broken tops?

42d7cb0c-6cff-40af-a0ab-ad5df4ef85bb-0
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.120
Why are the leave this so unsteady?

9abe1c6f-ed0c-47a6-b474-5dbcb68ecff8-0
01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.440
We came up with a simple thing I just said.

af56ce3c-710c-4a4d-a10e-25dc090f81b9-0
01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.708
Just do the seven notes Sarigama padhanisa in a certain way, 10

af56ce3c-710c-4a4d-a10e-25dc090f81b9-1
01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:22.800
to 15 minutes.

e9ea2092-339a-4215-94bf-d024ae0dd643-0
01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.760
You won't believe in a matter of four to six weeks.

19cd0243-2988-4283-90be-3d702c0abc56-0
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.560
Everybody like this today you will come and see.

0b1df911-6eb7-4515-82f2-b91b02bee12c-0
01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.560
We have another dimension of school called Samskriti.

30a6c27e-c706-4341-bcba-c96c3d811c96-0
01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.080
6 year old children.

6d4ca99a-34f6-4644-927d-e1043324ccb6-0
01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.156
They will sit like this, unmoving, 2 hours, 3 hours at a

6d4ca99a-34f6-4644-927d-e1043324ccb6-1
01:17:39.156 --> 01:17:39.560
stretch.

f59f1b1c-b58c-48e4-9c3a-2327525a3a5b-0
01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:46.946
Unmoving because above all for a human being, if he wants to use

f59f1b1c-b58c-48e4-9c3a-2327525a3a5b-1
01:17:46.946 --> 01:17:51.500
his faculties well above all balance, isn't it?

12c00125-a4c1-4b86-9650-cc2d0b6548bb-0
01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.420
If there is no balance, everything will go waste.

b5d0a556-f46a-4c5d-854c-d69ce5610158-0
01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.512
Your intelligence, your talent, your competence, everything will

b5d0a556-f46a-4c5d-854c-d69ce5610158-1
01:17:59.512 --> 01:18:02.180
go waste because there is no balance in you.

685249ce-f20a-4832-9586-7ca2d9b70fe5-0
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.089
Have you seen this happening every day to people around you

685249ce-f20a-4832-9586-7ca2d9b70fe5-1
01:18:05.089 --> 01:18:05.780
and to yourself?

5266a6a9-fc37-46de-a1ff-3b5106f8de45-0
01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.720
To bring that balance is ha ha between the sun and the moon.

6dc76779-75a4-4681-aff2-9a2ebbf36155-0
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.510
And when the neurologists looked at this, they said if you pack

6dc76779-75a4-4681-aff2-9a2ebbf36155-1
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:18.680
too many neurons, clarity will go away.

1ea7c7e0-3f83-473c-b8aa-46491a577a75-0
01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.275
The only other way to do it is to increase the size of the

1ea7c7e0-3f83-473c-b8aa-46491a577a75-1
01:18:22.275 --> 01:18:22.640
neuron.

b8ae90d9-5cf6-4285-8976-c72921d27ec4-0
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.494
If you increase the size of the neuron, the volume of energy

b8ae90d9-5cf6-4285-8976-c72921d27ec4-1
01:18:27.494 --> 01:18:29.600
that it will consume will be too high.

e38fa27f-8443-4f00-a362-3335ba0ff26f-0
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.965
Right now, as you sit here in a restful state, 20% of your

e38fa27f-8443-4f00-a362-3335ba0ff26f-1
01:18:34.965 --> 01:18:36.280
energy is right.

04d1e285-bda1-4444-9291-46917a1ca2fb-0
01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.500
Now being consumed by your brain is only this much so much body.

672cc05d-842f-4314-b239-4f44e115d0e1-0
01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:46.060
But brain is consuming 20% of your energy right now.

b4379593-c491-4302-9f08-11402ef35892-0
01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.140
It's a very high energy consuming part of your body.

da0f2517-e6ff-45fe-ac00-2dd0b6e050ca-0
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:55.128
If you increase the size of neurons, this body will be

da0f2517-e6ff-45fe-ac00-2dd0b6e050ca-1
01:18:55.128 --> 01:18:59.922
incapable of providing the necessary energy for that extra

da0f2517-e6ff-45fe-ac00-2dd0b6e050ca-2
01:18:59.922 --> 01:19:01.060
sized neurons.

f8f39791-2ec3-4e92-a76d-fd16f6dae2e7-0
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.135
So sadhguru, neurologists today say because of physical loss,

f8f39791-2ec3-4e92-a76d-fd16f6dae2e7-1
01:19:05.135 --> 01:19:08.692
not because of neurological principles, you cannot increase

f8f39791-2ec3-4e92-a76d-fd16f6dae2e7-2
01:19:08.692 --> 01:19:12.190
the size of the brain, but you can learn to use it better.

6489032d-cb0a-470c-b0fb-4f7e1d850991-0
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:17.604
This adiyogi spoke 15,000 years ago and he said when people ask

6489032d-cb0a-470c-b0fb-4f7e1d850991-1
01:19:17.604 --> 01:19:21.430
similar questions, can't we produce better human beings?

5f3a67ef-89f5-4e54-b11e-ac7fff2fc0f7-0
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:23.830
Because you need to understand this.

c73a7fa0-ab54-4df9-9c2c-436bfc869476-0
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:29.110
150 years ago Charles Darwin spoke about evolutionary theory.

cff46839-d47f-48d7-8782-e84718fe85df-0
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:32.930
Sadhguru Adiyogi spoke about this 15,000 years ago.

a4a01586-89c1-4ca3-84b7-bffd41c7b74d-0
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:39.269
So Adiyogi said you are just a product of this solar system and

a4a01586-89c1-4ca3-84b7-bffd41c7b74d-1
01:19:39.269 --> 01:19:43.050
you have your physical evolution is complete.

efa52bf3-8c8e-4b94-a1e2-3c7851d10f85-0
01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:48.123
If you want to physically evolve into other states, either you

efa52bf3-8c8e-4b94-a1e2-3c7851d10f85-1
01:19:48.123 --> 01:19:52.249
must move away from the solar system or some dramatic changes

efa52bf3-8c8e-4b94-a1e2-3c7851d10f85-2
01:19:52.249 --> 01:19:56.110
must happen in the questioner solar system at some point.

00ab2101-87c9-4d45-ba06-e8295572d3f2-0
01:19:56.310 --> 01:20:00.764
If some dramatic change happens in the solar system, then your

00ab2101-87c9-4d45-ba06-e8295572d3f2-1
01:20:00.764 --> 01:20:03.310
physical evolution will go further.

d634e27d-cd64-4af1-838f-ed75e7b9f01d-0
01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:07.148
Otherwise your physical evolution is complete but you

d634e27d-cd64-4af1-838f-ed75e7b9f01d-1
01:20:07.148 --> 01:20:09.950
can evolve in ways which are not physical.

1f1903f2-20c0-4ef7-a0db-6b0fc0e1f5a4-0
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.543
You can evolve in your consciousness and achieve

1f1903f2-20c0-4ef7-a0db-6b0fc0e1f5a4-1
01:20:12.543 --> 01:20:14.430
everything that you are aspiring for.

685a0236-4562-48a7-b08c-bd6d6fcbb8c0-0
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.430
There is no need for you to change the shape of your body.

9116f814-502f-40fa-9ab9-abe89ae2ced1-0
01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:19.470
You dropped your tail.

852ffd42-86b7-4e00-aa2f-3b770a1bb681-0
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:20.750
You don't have to grow a horn.

d15adbcf-e10f-43d4-963a-32e9ba0c4518-0
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:22.530
It is not necessary.

792172ca-a079-4ffc-bbd0-efa095f0b405-0
01:20:22.690 --> 01:20:24.650
You can evolve consciously.

851e7249-50f9-4c99-a187-10b6b9b2d844-0
01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:32.213
Now this body is a product of the solar system, so the Earth

851e7249-50f9-4c99-a187-10b6b9b2d844-1
01:20:32.213 --> 01:20:37.050
very much there, the sun and the moon very much there.

22e0cee4-4305-41ab-b945-b7b24e7bea75-0
01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:41.199
The cycles of the sun and the cycles of the moon are

22e0cee4-4305-41ab-b945-b7b24e7bea75-1
01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:43.370
determining everything about our life.

bd321f84-3756-4fa5-a38f-3f585aa4f50a-0
01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:47.750
In fact, we are born here only because our mothers bodies were

bd321f84-3756-4fa5-a38f-3f585aa4f50a-1
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:50.690
In Sync with the cycles of the moon, isn't it?

93c383da-9013-4d16-97df-3dc0c07cc6a1-0
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:56.577
28 days of a woman's cycle and the 28 days of the moon cycle

93c383da-9013-4d16-97df-3dc0c07cc6a1-1
01:20:56.577 --> 01:20:58.230
are 100% connected.

739799da-e716-4577-a995-f22fac14c3d9-0
01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:01.150
The cycles of the moon are 28
days.

cc1b28ad-69fd-4836-a734-130ea74d31f0-0
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:04.150
The cycles of the sun are 12 and a quarter years.

92763c67-a2d2-455b-b2e8-be18c1e4f014-0
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:09.001
Both of them have very distinct manifestations because you 28

92763c67-a2d2-455b-b2e8-be18c1e4f014-1
01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:13.390
days is within the arithmetic capability of lot of people.

81e4238a-61c7-4732-970c-6eaaee82e1bf-0
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:17.310
12, 1/4 years, they don't notice anything.

733fa560-4bba-4e87-a1b0-99b3cfaaf5e1-0
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:21.107
But if you observe every 12 and a quarter years, there are

733fa560-4bba-4e87-a1b0-99b3cfaaf5e1-1
01:21:21.107 --> 01:21:25.086
significant cycles in your life, significant changes happening in

733fa560-4bba-4e87-a1b0-99b3cfaaf5e1-2
01:21:25.086 --> 01:21:25.750
one's life.

e71a01a0-70f1-4dbc-b9cd-adf9eccf322e-0
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:29.970
Most people do not notice it physiologically, psychologically

e71a01a0-70f1-4dbc-b9cd-adf9eccf322e-1
01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:33.619
in terms of life situations, every 12 and a quarter years

e71a01a0-70f1-4dbc-b9cd-adf9eccf322e-2
01:21:33.619 --> 01:21:37.456
there are things happening in everybody's life but people do

e71a01a0-70f1-4dbc-b9cd-adf9eccf322e-3
01:21:37.456 --> 01:21:39.909
not pay enough attention to know this.

844530d7-1e10-4462-b74c-aea806ae4182-0
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.750
So bringing a balance between these two is important.

c1808119-99d9-4af6-9815-23fb6f19f5e3-0
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:47.342
These two sides, EDA and Pingala, are functioning very

c1808119-99d9-4af6-9815-23fb6f19f5e3-1
01:21:47.342 --> 01:21:49.150
differently within the system.

fa0c0d2b-879c-4073-8c86-23d4ca1acd62-0
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:52.670
That is why the alternation is happening right now.

86ea0a08-aaeb-4e3f-a563-b20691ecb980-0
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:57.135
Just take your forefinger, place it under your nostrils, and

86ea0a08-aaeb-4e3f-a563-b20691ecb980-1
01:21:57.135 --> 01:22:01.045
Justice gently exhale and find out in which nostril the breath

86ea0a08-aaeb-4e3f-a563-b20691ecb980-2
01:22:01.045 --> 01:22:01.790
is dominant.

9ef3acae-b6f5-4859-a174-1818717bd69d-0
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.830
Hmm.

9821097e-24d0-4dec-8edd-3740769299a8-0
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:16.680
Amne, if you're right, sadhguru, OK, it's either right or left.

3fc226e9-59bd-42cd-baf0-a1ef90faa00b-0
01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.960
You don't have 12 barrels, only two, so it's easy.

b7ca0ad4-af09-44e9-927b-bf50bdf9965e-0
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:28.281
So if you observe yourself through the day, you will notice

b7ca0ad4-af09-44e9-927b-bf50bdf9965e-1
01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:32.235
every 40 minutes, 40 to 48
minutes, the dominance of the

b7ca0ad4-af09-44e9-927b-bf50bdf9965e-2
01:22:32.235 --> 01:22:36.120
breath will shift from right to left and left to right.

bf063d5a-438a-4ec0-8fb2-481585121696-0
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.872
Have you ever noticed this or you've been paying enormous

bf063d5a-438a-4ec0-8fb2-481585121696-1
01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.360
attention to your life?

dc358ee1-df44-4b2b-95ae-c24e002dab83-0
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:47.390
Every 40 to 48 minutes it's shifting.

aaf7fe08-aac2-4bdc-9741-350d295977c2-0
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:50.990
If you're in perfect health, everything perfect.

3a231296-9653-4f48-8764-521e5232a0f8-0
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:53.510
With you, 40 minutes it shifts.

82794f24-c9e8-4ea6-92ec-ea7fc937f377-0
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:57.710
Otherwise it drags somewhere into this 8 minutes.

5ec8d0b5-63ea-467c-bc41-ed9b52155ada-0
01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:01.350
If it's anywhere within 4344
minutes, it's fine.

ef36f7ae-5681-4d44-95da-515bb5f5f174-0
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:05.042
How quickly or how slowly it is shifting says many, many things

ef36f7ae-5681-4d44-95da-515bb5f5f174-1
01:23:05.042 --> 01:23:08.441
about you, including how long you will live, what you will do,

ef36f7ae-5681-4d44-95da-515bb5f5f174-2
01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:09.790
and what you will not do.

078ec1d1-8bbd-4ea2-8b76-8fe5f16ac8b9-0
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.934
If we read your breath closely enough, we know your past,

078ec1d1-8bbd-4ea2-8b76-8fe5f16ac8b9-1
01:23:13.934 --> 01:23:15.040
present and future.

64fc7e76-7dd0-4b9f-ba31-17c3d4e0c1e7-0
01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.945
Because breath is such an important and vital part of your

64fc7e76-7dd0-4b9f-ba31-17c3d4e0c1e7-1
01:23:20.945 --> 01:23:25.628
life, and it is subtle, it needs a certain amount of attention to

64fc7e76-7dd0-4b9f-ba31-17c3d4e0c1e7-2
01:23:25.628 --> 01:23:29.885
know what it is saying, what it is saying right now to know

64fc7e76-7dd0-4b9f-ba31-17c3d4e0c1e7-3
01:23:29.885 --> 01:23:30.239
this.

03ac4eaf-fbb5-4147-80bb-561387008474-0
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.600
Have you noticed this?

5cfed707-e812-408f-9c2c-a913fa4b06d9-0
01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.940
If you're angry, you breathe one way, you appear happy, you

5cfed707-e812-408f-9c2c-a913fa4b06d9-1
01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:35.960
breathe another way.

a5268d10-f2ea-47e5-9c39-82cd60863d0a-0
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.240
Have you noticed this?

a0778cc1-4929-4f3c-84ea-602d97892dd6-0
01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:37.760
At least?

fc98f7a7-2985-4b67-bc19-c2e384996025-0
01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.320
If you're fearful, you breathe another way.

5f9478fa-a4e0-45fb-a1b1-471b56057e48-0
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.080
Yes?

b37291e6-414b-4f7e-a127-972868045dd8-0
01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.248
So the very nature of your mind, your body, your unconsciousness,

b37291e6-414b-4f7e-a127-972868045dd8-1
01:23:47.248 --> 01:23:50.560
everything is finding expression through your breath.

8b7a262f-1e2c-4ae8-b0eb-a4567cfcce8a-0
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.920
Some things may be drastic and you notice them.

c79464d7-a3e3-4bad-8723-b751513ca4f9-0
01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.920
Other things are very subtle.

348298d3-8fee-4631-8598-0633019192cb-0
01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.320
They need much, much more attention.

2e45182c-900d-4d98-ad69-7ccd1bf1a03b-0
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.065
Going further with this, the right and the left, the EDA and

2e45182c-900d-4d98-ad69-7ccd1bf1a03b-1
01:24:03.065 --> 01:24:06.805
the Pingala, or the Pingala and the EDA also represent two

2e45182c-900d-4d98-ad69-7ccd1bf1a03b-2
01:24:06.805 --> 01:24:08.960
different aspects of who you are.

1d542de2-dedc-41ed-add4-295aacbd31b7-0
01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:14.380
The Pingala is the logical dimension of who you are.

7523e3f6-b942-4de1-b220-28e9f3383726-0
01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:17.860
The EDA is the intuitive dimension of who you are.

a499138d-b0cd-401e-a1c4-81f1c3d3901f-0
01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:23.069
When I say intuition, because of the nature of modern education,

a499138d-b0cd-401e-a1c4-81f1c3d3901f-1
01:24:23.069 --> 01:24:25.900
intuition has been beaten out of human life.

06740281-9f05-4aaa-bef1-9f22849c0f42-0
01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.180
There's no room for intuition.

eb6eca63-6c7c-4391-874d-aef1ee459148-0
01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.580
Intuition is seen as mumbo jumbo.

86549a36-ac7a-4e5d-9e01-639b78f340a5-0
01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.300
No room for it.

9f56596a-1920-4704-9d62-41fe8e22565c-0
01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:35.900
Everything is logical.

7fdb1ebc-d153-42a7-a1d2-11c158d8e46e-0
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:40.283
One of the reasons why human beings are going through so much

7fdb1ebc-d153-42a7-a1d2-11c158d8e46e-1
01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:43.955
stress in their day-to-day life is they are trying to figure

7fdb1ebc-d153-42a7-a1d2-11c158d8e46e-2
01:24:43.955 --> 01:24:47.628
everything logically what your grandmother would have simply

7fdb1ebc-d153-42a7-a1d2-11c158d8e46e-3
01:24:47.628 --> 01:24:47.990
known.

5051dc49-b1de-4b3f-b21c-dc159e3e3c55-0
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:51.470
Today a billion dollar research is going on about it.

c8a7c8b6-1af3-457e-baab-b909d48fda57-0
01:24:53.190 --> 01:24:53.630
Yes or no.

4bfa7bfc-4a70-499c-a992-c5b996b47f9c-0
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:59.030
Sometimes it is stretched to ridiculous limits.

ae64d4e7-2ac1-499a-82fb-ce8a4d288d93-0
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:07.180
I happen to be browsing through a bookstore in United States.

65a14dd6-742a-4bba-82a6-c13d5e31bf69-0
01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.620
I don't read any books.

120241b5-a89a-484a-9ed7-60f4fe1a0b4c-0
01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.954
I only browse because if I read
2 pages, I know the mind of the

120241b5-a89a-484a-9ed7-60f4fe1a0b4c-1
01:25:14.954 --> 01:25:15.420
writer.

13082e40-e90f-414a-9265-1c5ae5a1a7f6-0
01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:19.820
After that, there's no need to read unless it's literature.

745d3160-46cc-43bb-bdde-67c78d8e7e26-0
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:23.380
So I'm just browsing.

9164c07d-cb88-4648-a056-30b5db81f8ea-0
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:26.747
I spend a whole day in the bookstore just browsing 2-2

9164c07d-cb88-4648-a056-30b5db81f8ea-1
01:25:26.747 --> 01:25:29.870
pages of every book, and suddenly I find this book

9164c07d-cb88-4648-a056-30b5db81f8ea-2
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:31.340
written for new mothers.

17ba0121-45d5-4419-9fdb-adc98d3ca716-0
01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.460
I'm interested.

4db21ec0-56e7-4d16-8eb5-8944261cbf55-0
01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.680
I was not pregnant or something.

c92aa34c-ecf0-49bc-a83a-f9b1137d98b0-0
01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.255
I'm interested because being a mother is not just about

c92aa34c-ecf0-49bc-a83a-f9b1137d98b0-1
01:25:41.255 --> 01:25:42.280
reproduction.

186eaa00-27d4-42cf-ab01-83c96003e895-0
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.080
It is you're manufacturing the next generation of people.

4cefe3aa-da20-4702-a5bc-dc09df14cf18-0
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.950
What kind of a world we will have tomorrow is determined by

4cefe3aa-da20-4702-a5bc-dc09df14cf18-1
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:51.840
what kind of mothers we have today.

5613959e-53a3-4015-a5ba-d648d4c01757-0
01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.840
Isn't it yes or no?

270c0ff9-3d11-4c8b-a2ba-60da099f4501-0
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.844
In many ways it is so because the influence of the mother on

270c0ff9-3d11-4c8b-a2ba-60da099f4501-1
01:25:58.844 --> 01:26:00.040
the child is so big.

4e65f91a-c78e-4153-93b2-0fc250e2bd7a-0
01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.540
I want to see what they're telling the new mothers.

85e895b0-1363-41ff-82c7-e57b725d7655-0
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.480
So this book is written by some doctor, many, many PhDs and

85e895b0-1363-41ff-82c7-e57b725d7655-1
01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.100
everything.

52d0c642-3a3f-4bba-8748-953a6a077aae-0
01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:11.700
As I flipped through one stupid thing after another.

5e4e67d8-a053-449a-83a5-4b61fa34e9ca-0
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.580
And then one significant thing that I noticed was this person

5e4e67d8-a053-449a-83a5-4b61fa34e9ca-1
01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.220
is trying to explain how when the child was in the mother's

5e4e67d8-a053-449a-83a5-4b61fa34e9ca-2
01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:24.859
womb, but in such close physical proximity with the mother.

cf8746f7-044a-41a5-93bb-22bbe8e0b8da-0
01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.580
Now the child has come out.

423265c5-377d-4084-92a2-99304da1a4b4-0
01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.660
It's still longing for that proximity.

a174d28f-186b-402f-9b81-b9f757940d54-0
01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:32.010
What the mother should do first three months.

28ef5f8a-a84d-4bd9-8db3-fa3c13c59986-0
01:26:32.010 --> 01:26:33.810
What she should do second three months.

7bfe8f09-e8f1-48d2-85c2-9576761b4250-0
01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:36.970
What she should do like this charts first three months.

1e66f75a-79b1-4cbb-a929-e56c42522afd-0
01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:40.050
She must kiss the child 124
times per day.

3d45bddc-9353-4473-b073-da9aac38f74f-0
01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:43.850
Suppose you are busy in the morning.

6e075d6c-abfd-417f-8dbf-4c5238682e18-0
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:46.650
You can deliver all the 124 in the evening.

401bf71c-8779-402a-a8c8-5da3128d760c-0
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:48.890
You are already sick in your head.

c7018a7d-0e8c-408d-8c9d-db1b8eb2a70f-0
01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:51.170
Child will also become sick.

c3430313-766a-4881-b3c0-73951a11c5ca-0
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:54.970
A dog or a cat or a pig.

79614575-6533-4d65-808a-884ee4b9d1a4-0
01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.750
Everyone of them know when to reach out to their offspring and

79614575-6533-4d65-808a-884ee4b9d1a4-1
01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:59.920
when not to, isn't it?

63f54fc0-8566-4609-993c-9ee2395f9142-0
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.669
Why won't a human mother not know this unless you mess her

63f54fc0-8566-4609-993c-9ee2395f9142-1
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.840
up?

9a079c76-04f1-4473-98f6-1b514f2090d6-0
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.556
She would also know you're not the first generation bearing

9a079c76-04f1-4473-98f6-1b514f2090d6-1
01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:09.000
children.

05bc2e9e-734f-4cef-b4c6-9cdddfebaa80-0
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.680
They've done it for millions of years.

6798c23c-2ad2-45db-ba57-4f169701473b-0
01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:16.920
Yes or no, because we are becoming all logical.

f5a74f83-52b4-427c-8486-d6b23f418144-0
01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.400
No intuitiveness, things that you could simply know.

a3ebda13-10f2-4db5-a76a-4878e838cb50-0
01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:23.290
Now you have to calculate everything.

c17df75f-44ce-4180-b057-a5508744ebcc-0
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:24.970
Everything has become stressful.

1cce6f92-aa7a-4a11-99a5-17111a4d75c6-0
01:27:25.210 --> 01:27:28.170
If you want to eat your food, you have to look at the package.

9d9ea81e-e322-44b6-9e94-320384979df0-0
01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:34.210
There are all that micro print
0.02 milligrams of magnesium.

895f2815-7262-46c2-9c38-53344b9473a8-0
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.090
Oh, that's too much.

88bdfd84-fa2e-461c-8525-bb3173a7ab4b-0
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:38.130
My doctor said magnesium is too much in my body.

cea35c30-1a6a-4684-9105-cbaeaf0f5822-0
01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:45.410
You'll go nuts if you throw some food at your dog.

4202e21e-37fe-4b6e-b0a9-f0e0be79cb18-0
01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:48.450
He knows whether to eat or not.

9850f765-0c38-4190-a50c-47c06ab5eae6-0
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.610
Yes or no.

6a5cd856-c338-4fd0-8598-ce8905883814-0
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:52.830
Just he knows.

14744047-4917-4ba3-bba1-7f5d5b6558f5-0
01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:54.070
Why won't you know?

d84e2d7e-0101-4c31-8693-c531c1d7cbb5-0
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:56.430
You would also know if you kept yourself sensitive.

1e8ac85f-e730-46af-9eb3-76b3127d32aa-0
01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:00.757
If anything comes in front of you, if you just as much as look

1e8ac85f-e730-46af-9eb3-76b3127d32aa-1
01:28:00.757 --> 01:28:03.670
at it or touch it, you must know whether to eat this or not.

3ca57efa-e246-46e3-ab82-1739c5d8e1cf-0
01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:08.272
But today it's become so ridiculous because our education

3ca57efa-e246-46e3-ab82-1739c5d8e1cf-1
01:28:08.272 --> 01:28:11.270
systems have stamped out intuitive nature.

88feb921-f0f2-41a0-a1ac-df1574b44c14-0
01:28:11.710 --> 01:28:15.030
Intuition is not another dimension of perception.

054de636-d7de-449a-ab56-2a25e693975d-0
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:19.116
Intuition is essentially a different dimension of

054de636-d7de-449a-ab56-2a25e693975d-1
01:28:19.116 --> 01:28:19.830
computing.

1e9d57ef-f263-494d-b10c-9a969365b974-0
01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:24.896
If let us say there are 10 steps to something, intuition means

1e9d57ef-f263-494d-b10c-9a969365b974-1
01:28:24.896 --> 01:28:28.740
you just jump those 10 steps and arrive at the same answer.

18a03006-913f-4ec1-9bbc-afa2077091c1-0
01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:30.420
It is like your calculator.

9f5a7f63-600a-4c5b-b82e-97e705e0914b-0
01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:32.980
It's a dumb calculator that you created.

c4208eb9-04ba-42d9-8aa9-70f5b32ae659-0
01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:39.100
But 13,334 into 16,754?

f8098fde-1191-4a57-97f6-6eff7b3864a4-0
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.500
How much You don't know.

d4d8c71b-825f-4442-8c18-d64dc3d578f4-0
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:45.466
You do, do, do If you do on this computer, it just tells you what

d4d8c71b-825f-4442-8c18-d64dc3d578f4-1
01:28:45.466 --> 01:28:45.980
isn't it.

449e0d1a-7fee-4eac-880e-deffb4f8bb11-0
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.829
So this doesn't mean it's smarter than you, it is just

449e0d1a-7fee-4eac-880e-deffb4f8bb11-1
01:28:51.829 --> 01:28:56.461
that it is jumping all those steps and arriving at this

449e0d1a-7fee-4eac-880e-deffb4f8bb11-2
01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:57.040
answer.

617a3415-60dd-4283-9cac-a4348b8e7854-0
01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:08.813
Similarly, there is a mechanism within the human intelligence

617a3415-60dd-4283-9cac-a4348b8e7854-1
01:29:08.813 --> 01:29:20.905
that with a certain before we do anything significant to enhance

617a3415-60dd-4283-9cac-a4348b8e7854-2
01:29:20.905 --> 01:29:31.694
the moment of energy in the system, so we will do certain

617a3415-60dd-4283-9cac-a4348b8e7854-3
01:29:31.694 --> 01:29:42.670
simple processes to bring balance between EDA and Pingada.

bd47a8f0-f6d4-4058-857e-0a7d9db74feb-0
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:45.830
For this we will do a simple process.

2c12bb47-4adc-4980-931a-9c3aea6bb3d7-0
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:47.630
Right now we will do a series of them.

28e51f10-c4e8-410e-910e-90df198047fa-0
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:51.101
Right now we will do a very simple process called nadi

28e51f10-c4e8-410e-910e-90df198047fa-1
01:29:51.101 --> 01:29:51.630
vibhajan.

56691e42-0591-407b-881e-0ad960b44eee-0
01:29:52.190 --> 01:29:59.665
Nadi Vibhajan means you must tell me what dividing the Nadis

56691e42-0591-407b-881e-0ad960b44eee-1
01:29:59.665 --> 01:30:06.160
distinctly experiencing pingala and Eida separately.

d91470d7-79aa-4cc3-b0bc-5456f6970b63-0
01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:10.064
This experience doesn't come to you unless you pay a certain

d91470d7-79aa-4cc3-b0bc-5456f6970b63-1
01:30:10.064 --> 01:30:11.200
amount of attention.

ddf59789-6820-4ceb-9036-f5cb8155a25b-0
01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:16.649
It's the keenness, keenness of attention which will give you a

ddf59789-6820-4ceb-9036-f5cb8155a25b-1
01:30:16.649 --> 01:30:18.800
clear distinct experience.

c90f1890-6291-4115-a82a-2b66feafa03f-0
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:22.378
How the right and the left of your body are distinctly

c90f1890-6291-4115-a82a-2b66feafa03f-1
01:30:22.378 --> 01:30:23.000
different.

a756ac54-4564-4a48-95e6-860945ab23c9-0
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:27.096
Only if both this masculine and feminine evolve within you to

a756ac54-4564-4a48-95e6-860945ab23c9-1
01:30:27.096 --> 01:30:28.000
its full scale.

fa91ca2b-5343-4102-a78e-639909f9120a-0
01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.920
You are a full-fledged human being.

1e253a1b-09a9-40db-b60d-261edbd73f68-0
01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.720
Otherwise you're a distorted human being.

6b037078-e864-4849-bf59-cc12e8884a9e-0
01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.960
You're too much of a man.

b6e081a6-af26-4f2b-99c4-261f66a47441-0
01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.280
You're too much of a woman means you're a distorted human being.

07e4094b-a132-45f7-a925-f9a113d77893-0
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:41.163
If both these dimensions are there within you, both masculine

07e4094b-a132-45f7-a925-f9a113d77893-1
01:30:41.163 --> 01:30:44.160
and feminine, this Pingala and EDA represent this.

2c758b53-8bb4-42d1-ab0a-91cfb3f54852-0
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.640
Pingala is masculine, symbolized as sun.

40bdcbaa-0881-4574-bcca-5582aa85c1e7-0
01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:51.800
EDA is feminine, symbolized as the moon.

f47194ac-9f45-4797-878e-03cef233f377-0
01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:56.280
When I say masculine and feminine do not understand this.

b4bcc067-196c-44e6-98d9-662bbf068f07-0
01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:00.822
Just as male and female, different dimensions in nature

b4bcc067-196c-44e6-98d9-662bbf068f07-1
01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:04.230
are identified as masculine and feminine.

6276f135-a71e-4b1e-9d00-5e2cb201df65-0
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:09.710
As you sit here, both masculine and feminine exist within you.

c7be9c0c-56f2-4d99-baa2-2cb3335d1267-0
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:15.870
Because masculine was more your body ended up as a male.

cb2aaeaa-ec27-4e47-8c12-ca9a7a759b45-0
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:21.590
Because feminine was more, your body ended up as a female.

16119207-f8b0-47c6-8da2-0af5e771fea8-0
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:24.990
But essentially, both of them very much exist within you.

48c2618d-4fd1-4fb8-abdb-9a7374f38e47-0
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:28.721
So if you're born out of your mother's womb, Sadhguru, how did

48c2618d-4fd1-4fb8-abdb-9a7374f38e47-1
01:31:28.721 --> 01:31:29.960
you come into existence?

0324b985-13f6-44b6-b7c6-c221c980990e-0
01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.760
Because a man and woman came together?

a3750dce-2210-44b4-a1bf-cede77a97c96-0
01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.480
You share.

597d2228-00cf-4a0c-982e-bee87635204c-0
01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.837
Just because you turned out to be a man, does it mean to say

597d2228-00cf-4a0c-982e-bee87635204c-1
01:31:37.837 --> 01:31:40.520
your mother has made no contribution for you?

41498b1f-a878-4c32-a595-01446717b605-0
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.040
Does she exist within you?

0ae1221f-f342-47d8-9fc0-91b82727b544-0
01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.109
Does she exist within you very much just because you turned out

0ae1221f-f342-47d8-9fc0-91b82727b544-1
01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:48.000
to be a woman?

8a2deb51-e861-48e9-a815-4857d3ed8398-0
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.680
Does it mean to say your father doesn't exist within you?

6daadf6b-067e-48e0-ac42-e174a9b72aff-0
01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.880
Hmm, very much there.

8a37dc4b-a8bc-419f-8091-6369f4a429f1-0
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:58.579
It is just that because of socially you become too much of

8a37dc4b-a8bc-419f-8091-6369f4a429f1-1
01:31:58.579 --> 01:32:00.890
a woman or too much of a man.

2ea64b9f-bc33-4b3b-856b-65d7f9c03c41-0
01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:04.410
Otherwise both these things are very much there within you.

25b02ea2-37ad-4a3d-b8da-9fc6b7c01522-0
01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:08.816
Unless both these dimensions grow in you, full-fledged, that

25b02ea2-37ad-4a3d-b8da-9fc6b7c01522-1
01:32:08.816 --> 01:32:13.021
you're as much a man as you're a woman, you're as much a woman as

25b02ea2-37ad-4a3d-b8da-9fc6b7c01522-2
01:32:13.021 --> 01:32:13.850
you're a man.

235dc246-b0bb-47e6-810c-5b202c61dd90-0
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:17.748
If this is not there within you and you're not able to keep

235dc246-b0bb-47e6-810c-5b202c61dd90-1
01:32:17.748 --> 01:32:21.590
these two things separately and exercise them separately as it

235dc246-b0bb-47e6-810c-5b202c61dd90-2
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:25.432
is necessary in your life, you will be a distorted life, not a

235dc246-b0bb-47e6-810c-5b202c61dd90-3
01:32:25.432 --> 01:32:26.530
full-fledged life.

b357690a-1421-4ca6-b8a9-3e274bd062e3-0
01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:31.399
If both of them existed within you and you can you can exercise

b357690a-1421-4ca6-b8a9-3e274bd062e3-1
01:32:31.399 --> 01:32:35.562
these two dimensions by will, by choice, you would see life is a

b357690a-1421-4ca6-b8a9-3e274bd062e3-2
01:32:35.562 --> 01:32:38.059
very complete and rounded off process.

e883bf9a-e61f-49f6-8c3d-50429efba61f-0
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:44.300
Otherwise, it's a very, you know, a divided process.

48240dff-6bc6-4268-9611-d4acac34685d-0
01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:46.460
It's not really a complete process.

0cba1da7-9700-406d-9e50-a273a374554b-0
01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.900
For this purpose we will do nadi vibhajan.

87e78611-58a3-418a-bc62-97bad596dc38-0
01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:53.997
That means dividing the Nadis and experiencing Pingala and

87e78611-58a3-418a-bc62-97bad596dc38-1
01:32:53.997 --> 01:32:55.380
Eida separately.

e89961f2-99c1-4358-a108-c1b7ae08d793-0
01:32:56.030 --> 01:33:00.310
It's a very simple process, but it needs enormous attention.

1d993dd9-d776-47e0-9cc0-ae865946f9e8-0
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:05.310
Everything that you have should be involved in this.

70d81585-6bc5-4ccd-aa25-1d3434c6d28a-0
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:10.009
I want you to pay absolute, absolute attention using your

70d81585-6bc5-4ccd-aa25-1d3434c6d28a-1
01:33:10.009 --> 01:33:14.741
body and your mind and your awareness to whatever extent you

70d81585-6bc5-4ccd-aa25-1d3434c6d28a-2
01:33:14.741 --> 01:33:15.749
can exercise.

cadb09dd-273c-4499-b1ec-bef6e864b6ba-0
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:18.270
But fully, it should not be divided.

2eb69cfa-2552-4062-a21a-a4c125614c90-0
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:23.070
You you cannot pronounce nadi, bejan, TCH Nah.

0ba3cbd2-9e17-400d-ba75-6f8f793594b5-0
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:24.110
You can call it cat.

4e993895-3ddb-42d5-b628-caa63a6de5f2-0
01:33:31.770 --> 01:33:35.588
Now we'll learn the last proper asanas for shambhavima, mudra,

4e993895-3ddb-42d5-b628-caa63a6de5f2-1
01:33:35.588 --> 01:33:37.650
Nadivi bachan or the cat stretch.

09708e51-0df9-4b26-86f2-b97a2ad94353-0
01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:42.219
If you do this asana on a daily basis, it will bring a sudden

09708e51-0df9-4b26-86f2-b97a2ad94353-1
01:33:42.219 --> 01:33:46.176
balance between the EDA and Pingala and also supponeness in

09708e51-0df9-4b26-86f2-b97a2ad94353-2
01:33:46.176 --> 01:33:46.770
the body.

2e01c928-1b35-46c7-a0c6-f2832c1b46e1-0
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:50.530
Nadivi bachan is a series of 10
steps.

0c9a2e46-8c91-4a9c-aaa6-1130ef8be35b-0
01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:52.850
We'll look at the demonstration right now.

Please don't do it yet.

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.100

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:20.718
All the four legs of the table are parallel to each other and

perpendicular to the ground.

01:50:50.865 --> 01:50:55.821
perfectly, or if the instructions are not clear for

237f8a75-6c71-4e80-b650-6cbb43bd7716-2
01:50:55.821 --> 01:50:58.300

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:29.802

01:51:29.802 --> 01:51:32.420
