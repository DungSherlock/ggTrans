Every hour, give yourself a crash course in Inner Engineering.
Before Shambhavi, you give yourself a two-minute crash course.
Just remind yourself of a few things.
Just remind yourself, it takes two minutes, consciously, not just as thoughts, consciously.
You do that and say it will work wonderfully.
Remind yourself.
All the rules are my rules.
I am responsible for everything.
What is there right now is all there is.
It cannot be any other way.
I am not this body, I am not this mind.
And I am a mother to the world.
