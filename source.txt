Namaskaram Sadhguru, I feel like I'm in a limbo between illusion and truth.
How do I know if I'm going forward towards truth or falling back into the illusion that
I always thought was real?
Now, the most important thing about spirituality is
you work incessantly with such intensity like you're out to get somewhere, your intensity
and the way you apply yourself, anybody who sees you, they should be thinking you're really
a busy man wanting to get somewhere, but you don't really care where you're going.
This is the most basic quality, just maintaining the intensity, just maintaining the necessary
awareness where you have to go will happen.
How can you choose where to go?
If you choose where to go, you are not a seeker, you already concluded you want to go
to heaven, isn't it?
Heaven may be a horrible place, how do you know?
Because your religions have always been telling you, God's have been visiting the planet too
often, it must be a bad place that they want to take a holiday and planet Earth.
So why do you fix your destination?
When you say I am a seeker, that means you're genuinely seeking, you don't know what's the
other end.
No, no, no, God, it doesn't matter whether the other end is God or devil.
Your thing is you want to seek as to what is true, that's all.
That's what a seeker means.
The other end may not be light, the other end may be absolute darkness, the other end
may not be God, it may be just the devil himself, but that's not the point.
A seeker means he's seeking, whatever is true, he's seeking.
He's not made a conclusion as to what he should get in the end, he's simply seeking.
The moment you make a conclusion as to what should be at the other end, you're no more
a seeker, you're a vested interest.
It is just that you're still working for the agents of your religion in a devious way.
You want to find God at the end, then you're still the agent of your religion, whichever
religion you come from.
Because what kind of God do you expect?
As culturally you've been trained, that's the kind of God you will expect.
Another kind of God comes, you won't like him.
You come from a culture where God must be a old man, you cannot accept an young man
as God.
He must be white, bearded, long-robed.
If you're from India, he must have minimum forehands.
Two hand God, we will not accept.
We are not going to accept two hand Gods.
At least two extra hands he needs, isn't it?
Otherwise what can you do, better than me, that much sense we got.
So, if you're aware that you have been in an illusion, that's good.
But if you become aware, you are still in another illusion, that's better.
If illusions have to go, you must stop creating, isn't it?
You must stop creating God's devils, heavens, hells everything.
If you stop creating, you move from illusion to reality.
If you start creating, you will go deeper and deeper into illusions.
So stop creating as to what is reality.
You don't know what's reality.
Just make yourself more and more aware.
Become more and more steady on your awareness.
Just bring little more quietness into you so that you can feel life a little deeper within
you.
Don't try to feel the sky, don't try to feel something else, no.
It's throbbing inside you.
This is the easiest place to feel it.
The moment you look up at the sky, imagine it should be flying.
The moment you think about God, imagination will fly.
The moment you talk about heavens, imagination will fly.
Here it's throbbing inside you, life.
Life in its most essential form is happening within you.
Anything you want to know about it, any truth that you want to discover about life, you
must look here because it's happening right here within you.
If you look somewhere else, definitely you will go into more and more illusions.
So don't try to fight your illusions because if you fight with your illusion, you must
be a real fool, isn't it?
When you know it's an illusion, what is there to fight with?
If you're aware that something is an illusion, why do you go and fight it?
And because you think it's reality, you fight it, isn't it?
If you see or if you're aware that this is illusion, it just falls aside.
It simply falls there.
It's got nothing to do with you.
So if you're genuinely a seeker of truth, you don't worry about illusion, you don't
worry about reality, you don't try to split hair, you just move into higher and higher
levels of awareness.
What you see, you see, what you don't see, you don't see.
Never said this is it, that's all.
Don't say this is it.
Give the privilege to me that someday I can tell you this is it.
I want to say that to somebody I'm waiting.
So you don't say this is it.
You constantly heighten your awareness.
Whatever you see, you see, that's how.
Whatever you don't see, you don't see, that's how.
It is just that the problem with people or the problem with the mind is, if it doesn't
have a goal, it doesn't know how to be intense.
Just to sit here and be absolutely intense, knowing that there is no tomorrow still to
be intense and involved in today is the fundamental quality of spiritual life.
Because I'm going to die tomorrow morning, if I have to be here, I will be the same way
with that most involvement, with that most intensity.
Tomorrow morning, I may know what's tomorrow morning, but still that's not going to influence
my today, my this moment.
So tomorrow morning, you may touch heaven, it doesn't matter.
Tomorrow morning may be hell, it doesn't matter.
That doesn't mean we are not prepared for tomorrow.
It is just that just maintaining that intensity, not being concerned about where you will go,
is very, very essential quality if a person wants to evolve spiritually.
The moment he sets a goal, then he has destroyed the seeking.
To seek means, you can only seek that which you do not know.
You seeking that you think you already know is just senseless, isn't it?
When you say, I'm seeking, it means, I do not know, that's why I'm seeking.
If I already know what is there to seek, the moment you make a conclusion about anything
as what could be that, then you'll destroy it, you're seeking.
You may spend a lifetime believing you're seeking, but not seeking, just trying to make life
agree with your conclusions.
This is the foolish effort that everybody is doing in the world.
They want life to agree to their conclusions in their mind.
That's their struggle.
They're trying to readjust life in a million ways so that it agrees with their conclusions
of what it should be.
So don't fall into the same trap.
If you're aware you have been in an illusion, it's good.
Now you should become aware that you're still in another kind of illusion, that's better.
Tomorrow when you step into the most beautiful place within yourself, you still know you're
an illusion, that's great.
When all illusions fall away, what do I do?
What is that to do?
Like to put it very simply, to put it in almost childlike way.
I think somebody's very famous, whoever said this.
Some Zen person said this.
Somebody asked, how was it?
You're enlightened now, how does it feel?
He looked up at him and said, what?
Before enlightenment, it was chopping the wood, washing the dishes, carrying water.
After enlightenment, chopping the wood, washing the dishes, carrying the water, that's all.
Then why get enlightened?
Without it, without it, you will always be hankering.
Now the hankering has stopped.
There is no need to hanker for anything, it's so complete.
The same act of chopping the wood, washing the dishes and carrying the water is not same
anymore.
Everything has changed.
Everything has changed so dramatically within you, that there's no need to change anything
outside.
There's absolutely no need to make any changes outside because the inside has changed so
dramatically, it's gone through an absolute revolution.
Nothing of the old is left within.
So outside, what does it matter?
Little chopped the wood, washed the dishes, carried the water.
