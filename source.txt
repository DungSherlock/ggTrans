The.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.380
The.

d1179442-a021-4bfe-9d82-61ec0eecfcbb-0
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.060
The.

9e728cfa-7ab5-4e6c-865b-963c661cc4ec-0

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:49.050
The None.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.470
Say this after me.

ccdfefb0-2655-49c3-894f-6d8ece9c3666-0
00:05:24.850 --> 00:06:03.030
Shanti Shanti shanti Hamaskaram.

9c50f96a-3dc8-4be2-8d4c-65d7682b8f53-0
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:14.770
What Sutoma Sadhgamaya means is, to put it very simply, there are

9c50f96a-3dc8-4be2-8d4c-65d7682b8f53-1
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.710
many dimensions to it.

4d3c9ce7-3bf4-4c59-932e-c5e3e3830a58-0
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.545
But to put it very simply, it means to move from something

4d3c9ce7-3bf4-4c59-932e-c5e3e3830a58-1
00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:27.570
that does not work to something that works.

de5c4425-a524-4169-b4eb-031dc2361945-0
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.810
You interested?

428d06f8-1f5b-44d7-9de8-4961e7de9bc9-0
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.360
OK, what does it mean by something that does not work?

27b6e33d-b937-46ae-bc64-f0cc55f8d6a5-0
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.761
Suppose we had this vessel upside down and poured water

27b6e33d-b937-46ae-bc64-f0cc55f8d6a5-1
00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:02.520
into it and then try to drink from it.

79e31100-271c-4301-bebe-0e2f1859eeb0-0
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.240
Will it work?

9d08f321-d352-4b93-ba22-b028ba43af20-0
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.000
Hello.

2b41ff6f-994f-4292-8368-ab96d0921ffc-0
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.943
If you hold it upside down and fill it with water when you want

2b41ff6f-994f-4292-8368-ab96d0921ffc-1
00:07:11.943 --> 00:07:14.080
to drink, there is nothing.

0e7f89ae-3674-4a67-acd7-894b52461f38-0
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.840
This is all that's happening with life.

4da53505-332f-4573-a658-d6b1799a27d5-0
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.410
Very simple sadhguru.

93c3d0d1-8990-4707-8edc-138373ef1980-0
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.250
What needs to happen happen from within.

a9d7730a-42aa-4ff1-966a-bc41b21d7934-0
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.690
You're trying to create it outside.

d08ba41f-dcb5-42c9-bdce-c0f4732ea546-0
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.730
This is all it is.

1b2e19d7-bf44-4654-860f-a31ff7011956-0
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.570
Your idea of happiness, Your idea of joy.

03690d6b-3387-4756-b499-acec15732bfb-0
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.970
Your idea of love.

138b7d3f-367e-4acf-888c-5b455e4f7b98-0
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.330
Your idea of well-being.

22b1de69-655a-4eb6-bd26-5fe2dbdb120f-0
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.890
You're trying to fix the world.

2e26b10e-3316-451e-99a7-645bd2aa591b-0
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.170
No, no.

f78b7c08-0222-49a1-a116-7c7f394bebea-0
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.930
Joy and misery originates from within.

2b1c473d-51ca-4177-a383-b915e742328e-0
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.290
Pain and pleasure happens from within.

898e943a-d373-4dfc-95ef-00e0aa79f13e-0
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.650
Agony and ecstasy.

1f60116d-5839-42ad-98a5-507298f1f5cc-0
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.910
Sadhguru happens from within.

7d303507-d6fe-48f7-9519-688a39ea10c0-0
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.230
Tranquility and torment also happens from within.

24ad0c95-1b69-4c6c-886e-a47cb4b72f33-0
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.945
So what should happen from within if you try to create it

24ad0c95-1b69-4c6c-886e-a47cb4b72f33-1
00:08:00.945 --> 00:08:01.430
outside?

1b65053c-3072-4e97-a1a6-627ef1c2b429-0
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.312
This is like holding the vessel upside down and trying to drink

1b65053c-3072-4e97-a1a6-627ef1c2b429-1
00:08:05.312 --> 00:08:05.590
water.

29090baa-4f1d-4068-a84c-79253df6a9aa-0
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.850
Maybe there is some dampness once in a way it touched your

29090baa-4f1d-4068-a84c-79253df6a9aa-1
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.670
lips and you think you've got water.

012fedf9-5850-4ca6-908e-b541074a18e5-0
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.550
This how life is happening in 24
hours.

d9161e40-761b-4ccf-b49e-f85f338c8026-0
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.590
How many moments of joy do you know?

6310fa50-9e1e-4e6e-82f3-3617774a8130-0
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.690
If you ask people, they will think of how many times were

6310fa50-9e1e-4e6e-82f3-3617774a8130-1
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.730
they tickled by life around me in the day?

640908f7-4c69-4f41-b376-270340f421e0-0
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.050
Oh, my friend came.

ddd0cce4-4256-48dc-8f63-301fc864c5ca-0
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.810
I was happy.

b351b010-d68a-4750-ba6a-5c0c76e0f888-0
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.410
I saw this.

12edab94-d627-484e-9964-0f1057905f3e-0
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.050
I was happy.

e21c4104-20e7-4188-9db8-c13422b13121-0
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.570
I ate this.

bc39eb20-64a5-4579-9bca-e2815e70011b-0
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.290
I was happy.

230d0144-e975-4946-b551-916f95dd18d1-0
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.170
No, that's not how it's supposed to be.

3cec4d02-ce47-4739-b1ab-c9fe27e74fa3-0
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.970
We're alive, so it must be exuberantly joyful.

e9aeb0bc-e52d-49e9-bbee-38a5a9666d85-0
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.786
Because that is the most important thing is happening to

e9aeb0bc-e52d-49e9-bbee-38a5a9666d85-1
00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:41.410
you, isn't it?

4ea40637-662f-4d31-b009-3310bf07e3b7-0
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:48.625
Hello is the most important thing in your life is being

4ea40637-662f-4d31-b009-3310bf07e3b7-1
00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:49.330
alive.

dad932e7-2151-42cb-8bb2-6a843e38fe82-0
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.620
That is the most important thing.

60e30264-b3ca-4985-914e-105f93626e18-0
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.500
Everything else is secondary.

1145d5bb-85cb-483c-ad00-42b64d2ab614-0
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.000
Well, in those many accessories we have created, some things are

1145d5bb-85cb-483c-ad00-42b64d2ab614-1
00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.660
working well.

9f9c2057-33ec-4ad8-b4fe-2c850d1a0be0-0
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.300
Some things are not working well.

4f33c164-359f-40af-b136-d924efb8a007-0
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.460
If the husband is good.

a0d5a806-39d6-48fe-b0a0-4ee5e3293ae2-0
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.860
mother-in-law is little trouble.

dd085bd2-cd26-4517-be68-47369f4628e6-0
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.020
mother-in-law is very nice.

077ff92f-1e57-4f5b-8374-e41481e99fb1-0
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.420
Husband is giving you trouble.

81cdd31b-22d7-4d7a-b4db-e17f922d413b-0
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.700
Wife is wonderful.

ea9796ca-f3e9-44f5-99d3-a691458aeea9-0
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.100
Children are giving you trouble.

90dafd28-5129-44ca-9f5c-45c0c1c36632-0
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.540
Hello.

800203ad-81b3-4308-a460-e7f0202cdd5a-0
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.020
All that is wonderful.

ec893d32-dd54-41ed-aa19-522b210a0e43-0
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.100
You don't have a job.

d8ae7980-7b2c-43b0-82a9-872af7cb663b-0
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.500
Something, Sadhguru.

8d0526b5-d07d-4a9d-a80d-c66a542410c3-0
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.312
Among the many arrangements that we make, some things are

8d0526b5-d07d-4a9d-a80d-c66a542410c3-1
00:09:20.312 --> 00:09:20.700
working.

7f450030-6f48-4f01-be72-f9e9adba8a7e-0
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.060
Some things are not working.

cba5df75-ef27-42e6-960b-0650b136fff5-0
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.660
Yes, but the most important thing is on You're alive.

dcc9eade-c57d-4dfb-acd5-8d23080642dc-0
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.893
As I said earlier, if you don't get this once again, let me

dcc9eade-c57d-4dfb-acd5-8d23080642dc-1
00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:33.580
repeat this.

9957caad-c612-4edb-88c6-6042df81ee41-0
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.140
We'll give you everything.

0454026d-7b92-43bf-8553-8b86d1e53995-0
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.340
I'll build a palace for you.

79ad174b-6381-44a8-8526-7d4975cafedf-0
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:36.940
I will build.

1351c61b-09a7-42fc-b362-89a0ad6aee49-0
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.420
I'll buy a Rolls Royce for you.

e2217744-a78d-4b9d-8550-6f8a0350d5de-0
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.580
I will write the whole cosmos in your name.

faf4c98e-d10c-428f-8f4e-72c752ed2429-0
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.860
I'll make a document for you.

45539c98-ece6-4dd3-b686-52d1cfc6cb9d-0
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.740
All right, sadhguru.

09d607fd-ca82-4d4c-9dc2-ecf3256386fa-0
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.180
Because anyway, the cosmos belongs to me.

6372db68-b1fd-4348-a55b-0e1eb28e5481-0
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.604
I will write a will in your name, but we'll take the lifeout

6372db68-b1fd-4348-a55b-0e1eb28e5481-1
00:09:51.604 --> 00:09:52.620
of you, right?

2835a1a4-e7bc-4274-bcab-4c7187b7e681-0
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.580
Is it a deal?

a32eadba-49f6-4c85-ba9a-6fdcf19f6198-0
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.220
I'm asking.

cac5b98b-7d13-403b-803b-71b4ec82c7c5-0
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.700
No deal.

c2d70421-359c-4e08-a3f3-d3eea59758b6-0
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.620
Oh, you're sensible people.

d4bb598d-f5c2-4d3b-a5cb-0dd0101d69e7-0
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.180
There's something working still.

93eada93-addb-4e8c-8f8b-6bc783ad2376-0
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.180
So now I'm telling you what should happen from within.

e46017d3-e583-4aa9-8575-158c7e05eae9-0
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.923
If you try to make it happen from there, it's not going to

e46017d3-e583-4aa9-8575-158c7e05eae9-1
00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:10.220
help.

159dbcd7-553f-481b-ae95-58178bd842c3-0
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.820
A mango tree has come up.

886c84be-d8ff-40ca-9f04-d7be427f579d-0
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.430
Somebody told you this tree has lot of mangoes hidden in it.

485fb076-9c78-4987-8453-10ed3c5e6995-0
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.590
It is not giving out.

8cc59e59-5768-48cd-9247-7dbbe3d24063-0
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.070
So you started digging the roots.

a11b0dcb-be10-4e2a-91c2-4eaedef372f3-0
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.150
It must be somewhere there.

9342fa84-866f-41ae-8a7a-26b45aa30171-0
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.310
No, it's not going to come like that.

679b6f7b-c323-47c8-aab0-80942656001c-0
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:31.630
If you nurture this well, mangoes will come, TCH.

9eb307d9-3590-4fe7-b9db-3347592e6cc3-0
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.310
Anyway it'll happen.

915318dd-059c-4bfd-9e6f-8262ec3b33f7-0
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.870
Being joyful is because this life is exuberant and wonderful.

4d970cf1-f187-4801-8dd7-f561410815fa-0
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.252
It's not happening because you got a job, because you got

4d970cf1-f187-4801-8dd7-f561410815fa-1
00:10:39.252 --> 00:10:41.870
money, because you got wealth, because you got a palace.

09bfcd4d-d5f7-4b0d-9edf-c85bedc70eb7-0
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.720
It's not happening because of that.

3bc3067f-786a-47a7-a3b4-04d2ec51821a-0
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.680
It's happening because right now your life is exuberantly alive.

548a0d42-87a4-4bc4-ad73-3d2e52290baf-0
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.840
That is why.

7c9d0d4f-67c7-4ad5-8617-935a2c4c81a5-0
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.990
So your business is just this, how to keep it always gassed up

7c9d0d4f-67c7-4ad5-8617-935a2c4c81a5-1
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.600
and well outside situations.

063ec25d-40e8-453e-985e-8fa337ce4d0f-0
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.479
They will not happen always the way you want it because there

063ec25d-40e8-453e-985e-8fa337ce4d0f-1
00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:02.600
are other people also.

e1c9f177-d614-48f3-813f-4545b9cfa364-0
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.131
They also have their own ideas as to how it should happen,

e1c9f177-d614-48f3-813f-4545b9cfa364-1
00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:06.560
isn't it?

19d32dc3-75ad-41d8-813e-8348925ce3a2-0
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.532
If everything happened your way,
I don't like it because where

19d32dc3-75ad-41d8-813e-8348925ce3a2-1
00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:11.080
will I go?

544ec9c5-2b69-494f-ad0a-7074b840281e-0
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.216
Little bit your way, Little bit my way, Little bit somebody

544ec9c5-2b69-494f-ad0a-7074b840281e-1
00:11:16.216 --> 00:11:16.780
else's way.

f85f8ff6-a7b0-4d3e-83f0-7922a9526027-0
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.940
It's all right.

fd209222-ee49-4a3d-930f-fdc05ed01ad8-0
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.620
But this one must happen 100% my way.

7d7f7574-61ea-4eed-b3bc-03539d10a226-0
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.140
So we will go into Shambhavi.

6e2dd0b0-0e5c-49de-bf51-27094b24b73e-0
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.340
TCH, what is Shambhavi?

9e83238c-d635-4a63-96ee-702387f92b2b-0
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.020
Do you know what is the word sham mean?

447fad56-ad53-4652-a8ce-f407aa27b26d-0
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.380
What does the word sham mean?

544e6ec5-39d4-4661-b307-64c428447241-0
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.100
Sham.

dc821315-649c-4e78-97a1-442a4046f4a7-0
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.760
It means twilight.

adafd3c2-89e6-4f9c-a6c8-6c630f8ad3ac-0
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.564
Well, generally we are using it in terms of evening, but

adafd3c2-89e6-4f9c-a6c8-6c630f8ad3ac-1
00:11:42.564 --> 00:11:44.040
essentially it means twilight.

396219b7-a9dc-48f3-904e-8944541ed7ff-0
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.920
What is twilight?

a3611b18-71e7-4769-81d4-03785eb4c5fd-0
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.936
Twilight means it is day, but you're beginning to experience

a3611b18-71e7-4769-81d4-03785eb4c5fd-1
00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:51.680
the night.

af1f3bbe-966b-4e60-b83c-4378c3e27729-0
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.074
This is twilight, or it is night, but you're beginning to

af1f3bbe-966b-4e60-b83c-4378c3e27729-1
00:11:57.074 --> 00:12:00.720
experience the day that is also twilight.

8f5b1ba7-cdc6-4334-b1aa-42b7a6248c86-0
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.305
So twilight means you're here
Sadhguru, the other has begun to

8f5b1ba7-cdc6-4334-b1aa-42b7a6248c86-1
00:12:07.305 --> 00:12:08.200
happen to you.

41158b60-0a08-4dda-8917-ab5bbfb48843-0
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.280
This is twilight zone.

c0d18e29-21d3-4e8d-bbc1-e4645a70019a-0
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.647
This is a whole phenomenon on the planet at which times there

c0d18e29-21d3-4e8d-bbc1-e4645a70019a-1
00:12:15.647 --> 00:12:18.720
are special energies which people try to make use of.

67345430-15fd-4d80-803d-c9e0a5327a60-0
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.079
This is why generally all prayers, everything here in the

67345430-15fd-4d80-803d-c9e0a5327a60-1
00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:25.612
four sandhya kalas that happen which are considered twilight

67345430-15fd-4d80-803d-c9e0a5327a60-2
00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:25.960
zones.

e86d271b-9306-4c57-8a7d-e331e379577b-0
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.320
The significance of Twilight is why Shambhavi.

034d3418-9825-42f1-b2d0-bd07cb224e56-0
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.860
Why should I tease the Beyond?

8de62948-c0d6-48e9-8340-845a70410e58-0
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.980
Because that's a fundamental longing in your life.

f6625166-cea3-4b8c-a66d-5c18cbda1d91-0
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.180
Whoever you are, you want to be something more.

5bfa80b4-94c7-4e34-894b-afa51af40946-0
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.580
If that happens, you want to be something more that happens.

495a2daa-4009-4f79-a151-a001dfa1b5f1-0
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.660
You want to be something more.

82b6790d-2f99-4d25-9da4-9d8f5e50fad7-0
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.898
Something within you is longing to touch something which is not

82b6790d-2f99-4d25-9da4-9d8f5e50fad7-1
00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:54.460
in your limits right now.

8fa7fefe-6a88-4c66-bde6-89817153f4e3-0
00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:01.211
Isn't it all the time whether a little child is jumping to touch

8fa7fefe-6a88-4c66-bde6-89817153f4e3-1
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:07.396
the sky or a ISRO or a NASA is planning to go into the empty

8fa7fefe-6a88-4c66-bde6-89817153f4e3-2
00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:12.670
space, or you're closing your eyes to do Shambhavi?

62e9bc1f-d587-44c1-9f0a-c1c1d6c5b9a0-0
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.710
They're all fundamentally the same longing.

758eb1e2-0088-427b-8d38-d9676169d081-0
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.030
You want to touch the beyond.

745e8f80-03cd-4527-92cb-a38ff66ea4cf-0
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.030
Somebody may think a child is jumping to touch the sky.

f413b363-aeb9-403d-8306-09b060022fe5-0
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.590
It's foolish.

dd2d8ecc-5365-480c-b13b-8be885c5d756-0
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:24.390
No, no.

ecf3b808-b209-4e38-b109-9b5583a25266-0
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.847
It's that longing which has built the spaceships of the

ecf3b808-b209-4e38-b109-9b5583a25266-1
00:13:27.847 --> 00:13:28.790
world, isn't it?

f9cd71c8-d381-4142-a4ef-57310150195e-0
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.270
If that longing was not there, who would bother to do all that

f9cd71c8-d381-4142-a4ef-57310150195e-1
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:33.590
stuff?

dfaeda57-92c6-4cc3-a488-f547dfad9ce7-0
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.790
It is that same longing.

a4bc08d9-91f7-4ba8-af00-bd9e1d513875-0
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.150
Doesn't matter whether you're little child or you're grown up.

5e047151-3a3a-4aa2-9f79-d3130db295bd-0
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.756
You're the king, You're the queen, You're something else,

5e047151-3a3a-4aa2-9f79-d3130db295bd-1
00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:42.430
something else.

b6940fdd-a58f-4833-bd62-e543814e1402-0
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.412
Whoever you are, you still want to touch something beyond where

b6940fdd-a58f-4833-bd62-e543814e1402-1
00:13:46.412 --> 00:13:46.910
you are.

1fb69450-1d14-44c8-9ca6-4ad70d3644e4-0
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.925
So This is why I said it is finding the longing for the

1fb69450-1d14-44c8-9ca6-4ad70d3644e4-1
00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:55.470
infinite is finding expression in installments.

428c1f58-6284-464b-bf5d-8c1888528ccd-0
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.430
This is your problem.

87f333a5-fbd5-4965-baa6-9b6c77be1181-0
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:04.050
You cannot approach the infinite in installments because you can

87f333a5-fbd5-4965-baa6-9b6c77be1181-1
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.330
never count 12345 and one day, say Infinity.

a36c4e13-d5f4-4e21-856e-42b99fce3e37-0
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.050
This is it.

22f986a5-5ad6-4bb6-b121-041e61c4a32c-0
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.210
Such a thing is not going to happen.

1e1105e7-a56d-4531-b344-4ba59688d6cd-0
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.717
All that will happen is if you keep on counting, you will

1e1105e7-a56d-4531-b344-4ba59688d6cd-1
00:14:14.717 --> 00:14:15.970
become endless counting.

d01b7e23-43a6-4667-885b-f5cc475bdf68-0
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.537
If you count for a million years, you think you will touch

d01b7e23-43a6-4667-885b-f5cc475bdf68-1
00:14:22.537 --> 00:14:23.130
Infinity?

5e408651-e38a-471b-9fe8-058bf0911e79-0
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.010
No, you will only become endless counting.

cc80c203-b530-48a4-8b89-a6a8e93f5144-0
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.140
So This is why life is happening the way it's happening.

02626849-fa56-4224-91ce-ee3211183218-0
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.311
Because you think more, more, more, more will become all, no,

02626849-fa56-4224-91ce-ee3211183218-1
00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:39.410
no, no More, more, more will not become all you will get buried

02626849-fa56-4224-91ce-ee3211183218-2
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.460
in the more all will not happen.

35643293-6501-481c-acfa-c8c9a7db0a97-0
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.271
If all has to happen in some way, you have to cross the

35643293-6501-481c-acfa-c8c9a7db0a97-1
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:48.780
dimensions of your physicality.

9e9c4d5d-091a-41c9-b6e1-41b5d91a285e-0
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.620
Physicality means right now, this body.

1bca4b56-0dda-4cb9-b16c-6b8033f940e8-0
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.820
This body by itself is nothing.

ca125519-987a-40fc-8ee0-f3c7aebf6525-0
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.742
So there is a mind, there's an emotion, there's an energy

ca125519-987a-40fc-8ee0-f3c7aebf6525-1
00:14:57.742 --> 00:14:58.190
structure.

db5df75b-43cc-4990-94b3-93669489c37d-0
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.030
All this is your physicality.

651f232d-ea31-4214-b6d8-868b818f5747-0
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.378
If you increase this physicality, will everything be

651f232d-ea31-4214-b6d8-868b818f5747-1
00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:06.830
fixed?

c80cb5f8-dc87-48a3-93a4-06885105a2a8-0
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.190
No.

87a5a6fe-5e01-4910-9232-ee851b5a395e-0
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.150
Something beyond the physical touches you.

503bac2e-8527-48d8-909b-ccf9d4b871ac-0
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.310
Suddenly you're infinite, isn't it?

99218a17-436e-4887-a072-355574d2ffea-0
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:18.854
That which is not physical means that which has no form, no size,

99218a17-436e-4887-a072-355574d2ffea-1
00:15:18.854 --> 00:15:19.670
no shape.

267f78cd-931a-407c-9a57-33d5ac817498-0
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.950
Obviously it's infinite, isn't it?

9f4dffac-5bd9-470d-b66e-8096740c22a7-0
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.150
It's boundless.

b5d04d87-48b1-4119-a8ed-574b4ffde882-0
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.910
It is unlimited because there is no physical establishment to it.

e7a52c46-3eb2-4e9c-8e9c-861c58c9900a-0
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.190
There's no definition to it.

27e2e1dc-5a7b-4750-89e1-482f579914da-0
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.910
So today, what we are looking at is to carefully craft a key

27e2e1dc-5a7b-4750-89e1-482f579914da-1
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:44.734
which will open up the doors of our physicality in such a way,

27e2e1dc-5a7b-4750-89e1-482f579914da-2
00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:50.190
something beyond the physical becomes a living experience.

3ff1681b-963e-4f98-8786-35002d95c04b-0
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.083
That is, if you sit here, sadhguru, your body is here,

3ff1681b-963e-4f98-8786-35002d95c04b-1
00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:56.980
your mind is out there.

efc1c5cb-cd44-49a6-a76a-6c6044a3cb55-0
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.180
What is you is little away from this.

49ad0769-8230-47de-b9d0-e4fb33d5ed52-0
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.597
Well, in the very first practice, one may touch this

49ad0769-8230-47de-b9d0-e4fb33d5ed52-1
00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:06.220
dimension.

6a9a4b58-91b5-4901-9c11-2e6361e2c528-0
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.660
That's not important for me.

7067f623-afb0-447d-baf3-b455c8536e88-0
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.176
The important thing for me today is that you build a device that

7067f623-afb0-447d-baf3-b455c8536e88-1
00:16:13.176 --> 00:16:14.180
works every day.

785e833a-7269-4834-b47b-fd62cdf487ba-0
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.860
Today you had a blown out experience.

e4911215-04d4-487b-8527-dec648976ea2-0
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.330
That is not important.

cc6a089d-063c-4507-b91d-504f7a8b8648-0
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.490
It's fine, but that's not important.

6f1b9977-dc4b-43f7-92a3-eb858baa3c1b-0
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.559
The important thing is you have a device that you can work every

6f1b9977-dc4b-43f7-92a3-eb858baa3c1b-1
00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:25.810
day.

0f47c6e9-b18b-4c29-a247-7b8377a3052c-0
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.326
You must understand this between other creatures and human

0f47c6e9-b18b-4c29-a247-7b8377a3052c-1
00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:30.810
beings.

2cbb1e49-03e1-45d9-89a1-40f81e0f01d6-0
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.398
Why human beings have gotten to dominate this planet is not

2cbb1e49-03e1-45d9-89a1-40f81e0f01d6-1
00:16:35.398 --> 00:16:39.250
because we are stronger than the elephants or the buffaloes.

618f613e-4491-42ad-8ed8-b73372e7053a-0
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.010
You cannot even say you're more intelligent.

32b720b7-83cf-4599-af68-ccb6c2540c2d-0
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.120
But we have the ability to use tools.

f67502b1-8a1b-41e8-9af2-95fafbd7b6cc-0
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.760
That's our dominance, isn't it?

aa428189-9c4e-428e-899d-d915102720a7-0
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.600
They just have to work with what they have.

08cee569-32a8-4132-bbc9-3c6b918eda8a-0
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.520
We can create things which will work for us.

f88e9e94-7738-4183-a29e-b2e74fed6fef-0
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.399
We can build machines, we can build tools which will do

f88e9e94-7738-4183-a29e-b2e74fed6fef-1
00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.720
tremendous things for us.

5d16af30-61c8-45b0-bfbc-5b968f9fb8bb-0
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.240
This is our ability.

1ab0d916-efe1-4850-b486-a7f5a62a4ab8-0
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.171
So what we are looking at as sambhavi is another tool,

1ab0d916-efe1-4850-b486-a7f5a62a4ab8-1
00:17:09.171 --> 00:17:12.120
another device which can do things for us.

4f08c42f-be8d-41be-98bd-99dbb58991b4-0
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:18.598
An energetic tool, subjective tool that only you can use, but

4f08c42f-be8d-41be-98bd-99dbb58991b4-1
00:17:18.598 --> 00:17:24.212
it must be crafted well and how to use it must be very clear to

4f08c42f-be8d-41be-98bd-99dbb58991b4-2
00:17:24.212 --> 00:17:25.090
you today.

5ff63d62-a46b-4cad-86bf-c4d0de7a6f3a-0
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.250
We will craft this in the next few days.

543a1c42-3b2a-4dc4-ac08-e4d5790dade5-0
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.901
We will support you to understand how to use it, when

543a1c42-3b2a-4dc4-ac08-e4d5790dade5-1
00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:32.930
to use it, what to do with it.

fc454470-de09-4b45-91cf-a93ad0ac4ac6-0
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:33.930
All this.

e51cc148-cbd2-454e-8b5c-26787611b5e9-0
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.672
This is important because if you have been, let us say for all

e51cc148-cbd2-454e-8b5c-26787611b5e9-1
00:17:37.672 --> 00:17:41.271
your life you were imprisoned in one room, you lived there only

e51cc148-cbd2-454e-8b5c-26787611b5e9-2
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:43.970
from the birth till whatever you are right now.

8dee1a3e-cc61-4af8-86d2-e6e9b55b625b-0
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.750
And a key dropped.

1a3ec357-171e-48e0-95cf-13ef7d263945-0
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:52.310
TCH, you know the the key dropped.

6a595a91-ec52-4b23-9c41-b4a2418d3116-0
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.150
You don't know what it is.

981789b0-5bf7-4c4a-b66b-202332cac4a8-0
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.190
You picked it up, this piece of metal.

68585a9e-c00b-43f1-b368-32c7bf8aef40-0
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.830
What to do?

4ee4b36c-f602-440a-bb19-5561f6b73d8b-0
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.430
You try to pick your nose.

5bd62c88-61b6-4f2e-bf30-0dfc4392c817-0
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.950
You pick your ears with it.

1bdad116-e1dd-42a6-9ae0-d494fd412dcb-0
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.590
Maybe you tighten your screws.

fbb638aa-ddf0-474e-b4cb-9e7a8b027956-0
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.470
All this?

aeee6cc8-85b9-4a28-b980-9967c473e510-0
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.990
No good.

91190203-819f-406f-a882-4d49007fd963-0
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.479
Only when you find that little hole in the door, learn to

91190203-819f-406f-a882-4d49007fd963-1
00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:16.940
insert it properly.

89e3061e-8524-47eb-8864-145b6dce8a51-0
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.740
Turn it the right way.

c4a757ca-b35a-404b-83ed-b4892a7e2fcc-0
00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.100
Ah, it opened up a whole new world, isn't it?

ac58270f-7d60-47c0-93f8-66e2c1b57d17-0
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.660
So a key is a possibility.

550986c0-932a-4f97-aef5-edc31c15371a-0
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.620
A possibility.

e9b359b5-c8e8-42d5-a8a9-bc108c673c12-0
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.460
You must learn how to use the possibility.

594440a5-0e77-41d8-bb9d-2e84f9005874-0
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.239
See, because you have a body now you can sit here and let's say

594440a5-0e77-41d8-bb9d-2e84f9005874-1
00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:23.530
you're in love with somebody,
TCH.

62ee5a9f-e2f4-4fec-a3cd-23e591b03d28-0
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.263
For that love to happen, you need the platform of this body,

62ee5a9f-e2f4-4fec-a3cd-23e591b03d28-1
00:20:28.263 --> 00:20:28.690
isn't it?

ce3cd850-6340-4517-9e6b-8fc293d483fb-0
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.242
Love may not be a physical thing, but for you to feel that

ce3cd850-6340-4517-9e6b-8fc293d483fb-1
00:20:34.242 --> 00:20:38.677
you need a body without this platform, all this complex

ce3cd850-6340-4517-9e6b-8fc293d483fb-2
00:20:38.677 --> 00:20:41.369
activity of life will not happen.

000bb0dd-7db1-45e8-bb84-0aaee896ca21-0
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.590
So even for Shambhavi, we need this platform.

32539a97-d512-4ccf-88e8-7378e3d416a7-0
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.727
Keeping the platform well, keeping it in a conducive

32539a97-d512-4ccf-88e8-7378e3d416a7-1
00:20:50.727 --> 00:20:53.630
atmosphere and learning to use the device.

ccf8b5d6-fea2-4cd3-9852-8615ab04f303-0
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.670
That's what we are going to look at today.

84d56bbb-5641-4009-bd70-cd2116fd5d50-0
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.485
Sadhguru, we came here because you, we thought you were going

84d56bbb-5641-4009-bd70-cd2116fd5d50-1
00:20:59.485 --> 00:21:00.150
to do something.

f18970b3-c14a-4ffe-8394-8e4d01de0fac-0
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.950
I don't know where I got this reputation.

aadf7542-eb8d-4820-ae98-e271166c6c51-0
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.750
No, no, nothing's OK.

ca459072-0720-4e7c-b254-ce116a7c45bb-0
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:24.286
It is just that if you put things right, if you put pieces

ca459072-0720-4e7c-b254-ce116a7c45bb-1
00:21:24.286 --> 00:21:26.970
right, it'll roar.

282f9233-98d5-499a-ae73-25de5d688fa5-0
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:33.563
I must tell you this, there was a time when I crisscrossed India

282f9233-98d5-499a-ae73-25de5d688fa5-1
00:21:33.563 --> 00:21:34.890
on my motorcycle.

3ec4c72d-59f8-465d-9b51-c264fd4b0282-0
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.688
Well, today I'm riding motorcycles, which are a

3ec4c72d-59f8-465d-9b51-c264fd4b0282-1
00:21:40.688 --> 00:21:42.930
completely different world altogether.

b0858856-262f-43d7-b0aa-bf1064e2b62f-0
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.090
Technologically.

a8424bc9-4dab-4cb2-acc8-bf3999602a70-0
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.120
Another another world altogether.

7ca851a2-e559-4d19-a02c-a0172e011e03-0
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.889
That time I'm riding a 250CC
Czechoslovakian motorcycle,

7ca851a2-e559-4d19-a02c-a0172e011e03-1
00:21:53.889 --> 00:22:00.178
single cylinder, 250CC two stroke, and the way I ride it

7ca851a2-e559-4d19-a02c-a0172e011e03-2
00:22:00.178 --> 00:22:04.040
most of the time at full throttle.

23da6d1b-ef9d-4965-a675-7d28ae1c548a-0
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.280
Every six months I have to reboot the engine.

171ebc41-73dd-4da6-a633-c7de844b964f-0
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.920
Every 25,000 kilometers I reboot the engine.

f86ea138-0621-4262-8746-afb414492af4-0
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.040
Otherwise it loses power.

1057d6a3-cc64-49ff-8147-3fbabe5d2ef9-0
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.044
Sadhguru, when it's so often you can't always go to a mechanic

1057d6a3-cc64-49ff-8147-3fbabe5d2ef9-1
00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:18.310
because many times my trips are more than that.

f8e18465-b4d6-4d8f-b0fc-a1fb2eb7ec5f-0
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.030
So I do my own engine.

2497d677-f602-4ad7-830c-3107173ff62f-0
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.790
So I'm planning one of my big trips.

0b8a4521-e4a2-4cd0-85a0-7f2c9ebd66d7-0
00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.310
So I dismantle the engine.

f2060266-0847-4c0e-9e0b-0bdf0a089a4a-0
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.938
That 2 stroke engine, if you dismantle about 20 to 23 pieces,

f2060266-0847-4c0e-9e0b-0bdf0a089a4a-1
00:22:31.938 --> 00:22:33.510
it'll become of metal.

09f73739-aae2-41b3-afb5-1b1d76bd37db-0
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.550
So I work on this.

5213221f-946d-462a-a860-07580c45aa0e-0
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.630
I machine it well.

11908f20-e56c-4619-a9bd-f8cf896d8859-0
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:43.240
I look at everything and my engine needs the best treatment.

34473431-6106-4f71-840f-4fce108aef84-0
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.631
So the softest sari in my mother's wardrobe, I just take

34473431-6106-4f71-840f-4fce108aef84-1
00:22:48.631 --> 00:22:51.560
only a small piece above this punch.

4c3790e7-2372-4a55-ac62-b072dc03c1fd-0
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.240
She didn't mind because she never found out till I'm gone.

b8bef951-5509-4115-8faa-3245bbf71cba-0
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.000
Once I'm gone, she didn't care about the sari.

ccf3b223-5b7e-45e0-8522-2555138d73a3-0
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.928
If she found out when I'm still there, then of course she would

ccf3b223-5b7e-45e0-8522-2555138d73a3-1
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:08.640
blow a little bit.

764c6bb3-0d84-450f-a58f-e1d32f3d51cb-0
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.800
So I give my engine the best treatment possible.

94d0e1e3-7540-407d-9187-75cb075f8d01-0
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.824
So one day I work like this for a few hours and get everything

94d0e1e3-7540-407d-9187-75cb075f8d01-1
00:23:18.824 --> 00:23:22.770
ready and put it all in one place because then I'm supposed

94d0e1e3-7540-407d-9187-75cb075f8d01-2
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.560
to assemble.

d943249a-acd8-4c0f-80b3-8aad27f7b55f-0
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.381
So I thought I'll shower, have lunch and come back and work on

d943249a-acd8-4c0f-80b3-8aad27f7b55f-1
00:23:30.381 --> 00:23:30.640
it.

b3863e74-de94-4ebc-82c6-2763ed8d82ed-0
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.840
So I went away for maybe a couple of hours.

ad740148-7f20-47e3-9e7b-007db1dcb2fd-0
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.490
When I came back, I saw my engine is gone without me.

6d07218d-157c-4ce6-bf65-3c6c043543ee-0
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.090
So where's my engine?

a857ee87-95ea-4eff-9de4-ae2d3b4ebff4-0
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.090
What happened was the maid came to clean the place.

ea563c77-42c3-476d-b3ce-e25a9e04861a-0
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.690
She looked at this.

f0dd38d8-080e-4587-955c-4a46241a8506-0
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.490
In her eyes this looked like metal junk.

e81c7a3a-ec54-47a6-8c78-49a4984bb33f-0
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.450
She put everything in one gunny sack and put it on the tick.

65c84aee-72df-4ffe-955b-619eae29a535-0
00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.170
Why are all these pieces lying around here?

d73c0fa1-b0b3-480f-973a-1c5727a793f3-0
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:06.170
She's doing her job, wanting to keep the house clean for me.

0389398a-a1d9-42f2-998e-69f01a56effb-0
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.170
My engine is gone.

89bf8a55-839a-4277-b76f-b52ac9f8a052-0
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.402
She doesn't understand,
Sadhguru, that if I put these

89bf8a55-839a-4277-b76f-b52ac9f8a052-1
00:24:10.402 --> 00:24:13.934
things together properly and touch it, boom, it'll come to

89bf8a55-839a-4277-b76f-b52ac9f8a052-2
00:24:13.934 --> 00:24:15.970
life and then it takes me places.

59f2f5da-c013-4dde-83d2-ee2e6ceb38c7-0
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.017
She doesn't know that I'm hitting the bodies of this

59f2f5da-c013-4dde-83d2-ee2e6ceb38c7-1
00:24:20.017 --> 00:24:22.650
country on that little pieces of metal.

2a180c2d-f9d5-4b67-9695-8c6d7210edaf-0
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.290
All right, She doesn't know.

f172f20b-82f8-41e7-a3b8-d5b4438ed421-0
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.595
This pieces of metal has enriched my life, taking me

f172f20b-82f8-41e7-a3b8-d5b4438ed421-1
00:24:29.595 --> 00:24:34.475
across the country, seeing the nation as very few people would

f172f20b-82f8-41e7-a3b8-d5b4438ed421-2
00:24:34.475 --> 00:24:35.250
have seen.

49eae5c1-6971-42d1-a5ab-c84c3a43b1bd-0
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.730
She thinks it's just metal junk.

51b68906-8dae-4b2b-9eca-b649dc7b33ef-0
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.990
So right now you have kind of gone through pieces of

51b68906-8dae-4b2b-9eca-b649dc7b33ef-1
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.930
Shambhavi.

ee9ef58f-c306-44a4-9045-d820da617765-0
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:53.352
The parts now, it's very important how we put it together

ee9ef58f-c306-44a4-9045-d820da617765-1
00:24:53.352 --> 00:24:55.050
and how we hold it.

1d5ada35-1ba2-4b64-a036-bac11f991155-0
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:56.530
Very important.

97d20680-dc09-4247-9431-cdca9e9dbaff-0
00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.610
Otherwise they will just remain pieces.

3db1cc0f-dd99-4f26-a50d-406100addd21-0
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:06.148
Pieces of metal by themselves are significant if you're

3db1cc0f-dd99-4f26-a50d-406100addd21-1
00:25:06.148 --> 00:25:10.464
running a junk shop, but if you put it together, it becomes a

3db1cc0f-dd99-4f26-a50d-406100addd21-2
00:25:10.464 --> 00:25:13.109
living engine which takes you places.

4c064600-3963-473d-9a67-63777e9641d9-0
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.110
So this is what we want to do.

08e1e2a4-be18-4f64-b1bb-37e952f11667-0
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:21.210
So I want you to pay absolute attention to what we are going

08e1e2a4-be18-4f64-b1bb-37e952f11667-1
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.590
to do now because this is a certain process.

c3d9dcad-f7dd-4034-9953-93d011a13bb9-0
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:31.005
Why I'm stressing on this is people do not know how to pay

c3d9dcad-f7dd-4034-9953-93d011a13bb9-1
00:25:31.005 --> 00:25:35.310
attention to things that they think is not so important.

16ec56b9-0537-4023-957d-51f3e1da9383-0
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.510
That's their whole problem.

0ddc3326-457e-40a3-ba9a-3808adec3e19-0
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.854
They have to think it's very important, otherwise they won't

0ddc3326-457e-40a3-ba9a-3808adec3e19-1
00:25:40.854 --> 00:25:41.400
pay attention.

49b38a77-4cff-4691-8de6-c34e4f5b00cb-0
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.469
If they're just walking on the street, they won't pay attention

49b38a77-4cff-4691-8de6-c34e4f5b00cb-1
00:25:45.469 --> 00:25:46.960
to how the dog is sitting.

23b4e499-bee4-4b33-9fa9-967cf24b5ddb-0
00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.240
Why is it sitting like that?

9389d4e4-339c-4558-be40-62b87d49468b-0
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.120
Very few people look at this.

ca2e1df3-8a1b-4dcf-9cd1-bc1191db1e6e-0
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.640
Why is a tree twisted out like this?

738b3c30-7049-4038-a95c-5b2bd388f0b4-0
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.800
Very few people, they don't look at everything.

c9c37ec8-e4d3-4269-a38f-efed788c4460-0
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.680
Only thing is, if you tell them this is their property, tongue

c9c37ec8-e4d3-4269-a38f-efed788c4460-1
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.960
will hang out.

a3268f8b-991a-4ffc-9c17-cc53b0a2ac6a-0
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.837
Something that they think is important only to that they pay

a3268f8b-991a-4ffc-9c17-cc53b0a2ac6a-1
00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:13.480
attention.

8368a0a7-02cc-46e8-a487-d30c6864ca8f-0
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.880
This is why human mind has become so constricted.

e5cc1427-227e-49ef-9539-0eaeeecf1b93-0
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.280
Human experience has become so miserable.

ecb6157f-8291-4bcd-80ea-93aca95e058a-0
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.200
Tell me one thing that is not important in this existence.

1cb7fed9-cd57-476f-81d0-d41081f0129a-0
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.320
Hello.

cac3c0da-0c69-4cb5-8ade-2ca8aa168fae-0
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.080
You think a grasshopper is not important?

ea5dbcb9-a739-4d31-bb40-43fab5f1d3c3-0
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.080
I'm asking you.

f04a3078-b428-48e1-84fd-b023b7ecaf8f-0
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.400
Or maybe you've not seen one.

db278296-56bc-4fca-8218-08624efc6cf1-0
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.660
You never saw a grasshopper.

697e0593-67b3-4621-8ee5-17543f470bcd-0
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.060
What is that grass, Sadhguru?

045db980-02b8-44e5-8a94-aae8226e48e3-0
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.500
Is it the thing we smoke?

b0fa63a3-ffb3-4da5-9824-e4741c5ff381-0
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.020
Lot of young people on the online program Grass.

044f326c-d49c-4b7d-919d-066b30ac25f8-0
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.660
Oh sadhguru, that one.

c28d7f83-5c99-4a67-86cb-596d4ef99b34-0
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.500
No, no.

40387eb3-d737-4bfc-8658-9191bbb8ad1b-0
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.344
There is something called as grass, which every other animal

40387eb3-d737-4bfc-8658-9191bbb8ad1b-1
00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:52.660
eats.

f038c041-2e37-4269-811d-a7936ac3fa73-0
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.148
And there are some things hopping around there that I'm

f038c041-2e37-4269-811d-a7936ac3fa73-1
00:26:56.148 --> 00:26:57.020
talking about.

a6ab488c-43b6-4e2f-bdfe-0b04f79f033b-0
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.420
And there are varieties of them.

e9b29f4f-6370-4d1c-9be3-1456738cb314-0
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.780
Hundreds of varieties of grasshoppers.

689ba2cc-8984-4c1d-8482-59450aac04d0-0
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.563
Whoever, whatever the hell created this planet, must have a

689ba2cc-8984-4c1d-8482-59450aac04d0-1
00:27:07.563 --> 00:27:11.030
reason and a purpose for all of them, isn't it?

a114e861-0c35-486a-badb-49297b72300b-0
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.910
When we did not realize this, we started cutting our own lifeout.

bb96889b-4be8-42b8-ac2a-c1728cafa8a8-0
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.590
Today we're talking about ecological disaster.

648d3731-0cb6-4df3-b6b1-506883d4c781-0
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.710
What do you think it is?

df7fe20b-5863-4768-9b39-387e8f30161c-0
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.110
Oh, we must save the tiger.

adceeb19-a72f-411d-80cd-92d7a5a086ff-0
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.950
Isn't no sadhguru.

a092ea20-2ec8-4aa6-87fe-a81dcc538222-0
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.390
Yes, we definitely should save the tiger.

1f5c27a7-8e19-460f-b19c-b6cb3fd36391-0
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.270
You can be.

77c32b18-0271-4cee-becd-b96a91e77548-0
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.430
It's breakfast today.

7a5f3da0-d6a4-4f87-8df1-8a10bdabd8e7-0
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.060
You wish.

fd9c019b-ee4b-43dc-8b9d-17a3f7528d20-0
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.809
You know, if you want to save the tiger, feed the tiger, Isn't

fd9c019b-ee4b-43dc-8b9d-17a3f7528d20-1
00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:35.940
it?

58b99010-1443-4e14-953b-1e94c2fd85d8-0
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.380
There's no better thing to do than to feed it with yourself.

97a8ac06-4ec5-4026-b793-d49d8e99d914-0
00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.260
Tiger is a spectacular animal.

4e157987-04a5-4d2e-929b-6327526a3854-0
00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.620
Definitely we should see it is saved.

91fec62a-b82e-499d-8d73-3abdbfe5d393-0
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.860
But I want you to understand.

86488298-2aa6-4b8d-828a-96f28285ce04-0
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.220
Suppose such a thing should never happen.

86b09cef-0a8d-4211-a37d-c7864f7a5115-0
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.060
But suppose it happened.

ce2af4d7-fbbe-4d71-8211-63f9c9fcd9ae-0
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.340
The tiger disappeared.

85dfa9a3-ea02-4649-93ca-d451be6dad78-0
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.120
Many imbalances will happen.

30c52ac8-4000-42e4-b5a8-9eef8148138e-0
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.360
There will be too many deer.

a69c33c9-d750-41e4-bbfd-716ecf377c5b-0
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.560
There will be too many buffaloes.

4602c9ab-07ce-4e46-8d9e-8c80f184b0c0-0
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.040
There will be too many, so many things.

e3f9a67c-35f3-4e45-959d-7b8664d0d9b6-0
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.520
Ah, we will learn to handle it somehow.

3fce5d7f-1946-47c2-9ac1-0a66ac1b553b-0
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.840
But if the insects and the worms disappear, your life will end.

bc08a44f-8ffd-4bee-a98f-34c8a75d3e5d-0
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.040
You must know this.

ef0dc4b2-0172-45c4-8517-d20bced8f919-0
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.720
So what you thought is not so important.

3f0d67b3-1c89-48ff-8994-b61516650808-0
00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.920
Is playing a very significant role in your life, isn't it?

c3d097bd-29a3-48ce-b15a-9ff05b7ce6d4-0
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.285
If all the worms in the soil disappeared, Believe me, in one

c3d097bd-29a3-48ce-b15a-9ff05b7ce6d4-1
00:28:25.285 --> 00:28:27.850
and half year's time, the world will end.

00650df2-97e3-4796-a179-4001fd900185-0
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:32.469
In terms of life, your life, my life, every other life will end

00650df2-97e3-4796-a179-4001fd900185-1
00:28:32.469 --> 00:28:34.490
just if the worms disappear.

8b9b57d0-fb00-42af-9c82-513f99af0362-0
00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:40.160
When you thought somebody is useless, worthless, no good you

8b9b57d0-fb00-42af-9c82-513f99af0362-1
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.410
did you call somebody a worm in your life?

d08df84e-964a-4f3e-9017-628d805d5266-0
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.370
You didn't know?

804c6da3-42f8-484d-a467-34361949b650-0
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.170
Because that's a great compliment.

9c06d7cd-d84f-41fe-84b8-b59bae3f547b-0
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:47.770
You're a worm.

51afb697-4d6b-4c9a-a75b-8ad2f6b67e5b-0
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.457
Means you're the most important creature in this supporting the

51afb697-4d6b-4c9a-a75b-8ad2f6b67e5b-1
00:28:51.457 --> 00:28:52.610
life on this planet.

85bbd5b1-5d57-4c92-b994-898d38bb772a-0
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.172
I know you didn't say it with that emotion, but I'm saying

85bbd5b1-5d57-4c92-b994-898d38bb772a-1
00:28:56.172 --> 00:28:56.830
that's the fact.

b7d4f4e8-9eb7-47a3-9c06-b424d696b9d7-0
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.350
So when you walk into this path, you must stop.

a1ff1bbc-1313-4c9f-b1d9-c460248e657b-0
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.684
What is important, what is not important, what is important,

a1ff1bbc-1313-4c9f-b1d9-c460248e657b-1
00:29:09.684 --> 00:29:13.076
what is not important is essentially determined by what

a1ff1bbc-1313-4c9f-b1d9-c460248e657b-2
00:29:13.076 --> 00:29:14.470
you're identified with.

50fa20b4-6d5d-49d3-b35f-8a09d8c944fc-0
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.190
Ohio, this person is very important for me.

ee84fc54-22c8-4a60-ba74-cef7629fb1e7-0
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.630
Why?

709152e5-59f4-41e7-b5c2-cadcd4623087-0
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.310
Oh, because he's my uncle.

b94ea487-fd0e-40a7-8017-b9586dc450da-0
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.770
This was an see.

ca004ae4-50fc-4972-a4d7-524faddb2cf0-0
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.370
No good.

d5f0ce35-495d-4ea4-8184-a91c062d5d9d-0
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:25.490
Why?

f662dcf9-7dca-4b17-a312-366d2353d36f-0
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.930
I don't know who the hell she is.

eca86f83-863c-4d0c-b16b-3026ca3023b1-0
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.530
This must go in you.

f4945435-afaa-4f82-9958-f40d50ff5416-0
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:36.663
This is why I want you for the next 40 minutes to sit here like

f4945435-afaa-4f82-9958-f40d50ff5416-1
00:29:36.663 --> 00:29:38.290
a mother to the world.

e07b25ad-6c9e-4eb3-a24a-620195cfe716-0
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:38.530
Hmm.

b4e1d2e0-07b7-4241-8336-efa9189e477e-0
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:40.290
Hello.

18cd0318-3372-4808-ac39-4228ce882568-0
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.050
This means everything is just the same to you.

61aab69f-fa65-4f81-926b-29b5b91fda91-0
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.250
Equally involved with everything, See?

f5fe0817-653e-48cc-be1a-dc8eee9f3a8f-0
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:54.196
Being involved with everything and transacting with everything

f5fe0817-653e-48cc-be1a-dc8eee9f3a8f-1
00:29:54.196 --> 00:29:56.160
are two different things.

737869a9-ea69-4a07-ac7e-a4de03540396-0
00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.080
With so many things, we have no conscious transaction.

44371ff3-d9ee-4a27-870c-0b25af1e3d05-0
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.280
We don't go and transact with the worms consciously.

212ca6ce-0ff7-4c2a-ad07-9e1b8c699033-0
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.800
But transaction is happening, isn't it?

83a48dcf-c91b-42e9-92bf-0ea6edb218dd-0
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.000
Hello.

0ed081fd-d891-4af1-8501-fc065c969349-0
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.680
We are not transacting with the trees outside.

ddf2d7ec-ea8c-4de2-90bb-09633d18c134-0
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.080
Consciously maybe, but transaction is happening.

90fc6cd9-8480-452f-adb5-06f23cf67594-0
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.720
What they exhale, we are inhaling.

0ef5bec4-19d8-4272-9575-9e877a741699-0
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.080
What we exhale they're inhaling happening or no.

30c7d50b-2a57-4a36-89d9-a4b780605105-0
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.030
So this is important.

ff568b0b-b516-41b3-b340-188cff2f77ac-0
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.893
When you say I want to walk the spiritual path this is important

ff568b0b-b516-41b3-b340-188cff2f77ac-1
00:30:29.893 --> 00:30:34.532
that you don't decide what is important what is not important

ff568b0b-b516-41b3-b340-188cff2f77ac-2
00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:35.430
Ah sadhguru.

2c35dc6b-4e50-4484-8291-69983ba6261e-0
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:41.587
I've heard all the all your video YouTube video sadhguru

2c35dc6b-4e50-4484-8291-69983ba6261e-1
00:30:41.587 --> 00:30:48.717
this and all I know I know world is one that's a news channel you

2c35dc6b-4e50-4484-8291-69983ba6261e-2
00:30:48.717 --> 00:30:52.930
it is not something that you fix here.

714044a0-0f5a-4c49-846d-6c7b20a91db0-0
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.613
It is something that you bring into your attention that you if

714044a0-0f5a-4c49-846d-6c7b20a91db0-1
00:30:56.613 --> 00:31:00.096
you look at two people this may be your child that may be your

714044a0-0f5a-4c49-846d-6c7b20a91db0-2
00:31:00.096 --> 00:31:01.810
father that may be your mother.

dcab7004-b453-4c73-ae96-95c1ea47b7f9-0
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.890
That may be your wife that may be your husband.

dcbb6b20-4653-4e5c-ba60-7f5cf8f33c13-0
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.530
That may be your somebody grandmother.

588f1a26-4f89-43d2-a9f1-26daef9a3079-0
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.290
I'm sorry.

681be33b-8adf-4703-8ab7-a1c32eb92b90-0
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.250
I didn't mean that I OK.

7bbc3c87-23d7-4977-8027-de29a39ee933-0
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.970
It's OK.

52d931e1-a727-43c4-b7d6-7081b1744c89-0
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.490
I'm pointing at the gaps not you.

b5259d36-7d14-43da-8ae0-32cfe0d41422-0
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:12.970
OK.

996120c1-011d-4d83-936a-9fc46176c642-0
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:20.659
It doesn't matter if you can look at everything the same

996120c1-011d-4d83-936a-9fc46176c642-1
00:31:20.659 --> 00:31:23.180
sense of involvement within you.

e4fc584f-6696-45d8-8458-8d0155042673-0
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.380
Transaction has to be judicious, isn't it?

ce0177f5-c2f5-4500-91e0-baee4be442e9-0
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.414
This is your friend one way, this is a new person another

ce0177f5-c2f5-4500-91e0-baee4be442e9-1
00:31:29.414 --> 00:31:31.903
way, this is your neighbor another way, that is, your

ce0177f5-c2f5-4500-91e0-baee4be442e9-2
00:31:31.903 --> 00:31:32.780
spouse another way.

afd25b42-5ffd-4aaa-87a2-25ae0e5e880b-0
00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.300
Yes or no.

92014711-e1e7-40f7-beeb-34e014b6f7ba-0
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.724
Transactions are different, but looking at everything with the

92014711-e1e7-40f7-beeb-34e014b6f7ba-1
00:31:38.724 --> 00:31:43.668
same level of involvement, Once you do this, you're above all

92014711-e1e7-40f7-beeb-34e014b6f7ba-2
00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:46.540
your compulsive desiring processes.

74d0726a-e83b-40f7-8fd8-0e30eb982f3b-0
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.700
Do you understand?

ccc69e14-dcc6-4f9e-bdca-189591f968dc-0
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.094
You can look at everything with deep involvement without

ccc69e14-dcc6-4f9e-bdca-189591f968dc-1
00:31:52.094 --> 00:31:54.210
thinking how to possess something.

72b4ddd8-7b1e-4c72-968a-c37494b792ea-0
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.356
If this one thing goes in you, you will craft your life the way

72b4ddd8-7b1e-4c72-968a-c37494b792ea-1
00:31:58.356 --> 00:32:01.643
you want rather than being in compulsive desires which take

72b4ddd8-7b1e-4c72-968a-c37494b792ea-2
00:32:01.643 --> 00:32:04.766
you all over the place, not knowing what the hell you're

72b4ddd8-7b1e-4c72-968a-c37494b792ea-3
00:32:04.766 --> 00:32:06.410
doing at the end of your life.

45757473-499c-483b-9487-2c8175cef1a9-0
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.010
You went after this.

c55fbdca-8e1a-4390-b9f9-20bc8979b7ff-0
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.479
You went after that because at that moment that felt like this

c55fbdca-8e1a-4390-b9f9-20bc8979b7ff-1
00:32:12.479 --> 00:32:12.810
is it.

e4ea5b40-3039-4363-a633-b227f4641ebd-0
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.270
Has this happened to you at many points in your life?

4ccb0613-17c4-4a34-914f-711cb000b26c-0
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:16.470
Huh.

5924e540-e116-4535-851e-b33f54aeee13-0
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.190
When you were 18, you thought, this is it.

1556fd84-5d64-40f2-9652-9b65329e526a-0
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.350
If I don't get this, I will die.

b11b1ca9-8cdb-453b-905a-7e0d1716ea49-0
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.590
I must have it.

14cb8150-00b2-4f68-9d66-9915f0476cb3-0
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.430
You became 25.

a2f2d971-e490-410e-9c2a-e42266a1629a-0
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.510
You look back and see.

314ec9e9-6446-4215-b4d2-e215ded7d16b-0
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.670
Oh, I was little loose at that time.

152bf60e-a13b-425d-858d-dfed95d094ca-0
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.804
This is common for people to say, especially in the West,

152bf60e-a13b-425d-858d-dfed95d094ca-1
00:32:32.804 --> 00:32:34.350
that, oh, I was only 17.

6a9ac154-08b1-4048-ad12-1f7303caa4e4-0
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.630
You know, why did you do these crazy things?

136f2a6e-a12c-427a-8d9b-53e4e7df9230-0
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.351
Oh, I was only 1717 is supposed to be madness, is it then if you

136f2a6e-a12c-427a-8d9b-53e4e7df9230-1
00:32:41.351 --> 00:32:44.290
ask them at 50, why did you do this at 35?

798ef9e9-a1c6-4cf5-9381-98089aeb113e-0
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.250
Oh, I was only 35, you know.

1877beba-f0aa-4820-95f3-06eacb7fcc44-0
00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:52.187
Well, I'm telling you, these things can be gotten rid of very

1877beba-f0aa-4820-95f3-06eacb7fcc44-1
00:32:52.187 --> 00:32:56.395
early in your life, whatever stage you are in right now,

1877beba-f0aa-4820-95f3-06eacb7fcc44-2
00:32:56.395 --> 00:33:00.973
simply by learning to involve with everything transaction you

1877beba-f0aa-4820-95f3-06eacb7fcc44-3
00:33:00.973 --> 00:33:02.449
conduct judiciously.

874c6ec7-180b-422f-8540-94673482e1b6-0
00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.433
When we say your ability to respond is limitless, there is

874c6ec7-180b-422f-8540-94673482e1b6-1
00:33:07.433 --> 00:33:08.770
involvement, action.

c500d33c-a912-4953-855d-688e2b2b58ba-0
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.000
Judicious because action needs a prescription.

de52a400-db61-44ae-b8fe-0358f8f2acce-0
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.320
How much you can do what you can do.

b5a731bf-0a5f-4e9a-8373-130b75224273-0
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.240
What is the time you have?

7918c9ce-3c56-44a1-b1c7-6800268de122-0
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.280
What is the energy you have?

d0fb92ac-9301-4f21-8c0d-29d38ab7f9e6-0
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.440
Everything has to be looked at before you act, isn't it?

4e7ba778-ba20-4a4b-ba8a-47c30966c9dc-0
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.800
Action is a different matter.

1c1faef9-1908-45bb-9127-ea2b936cd59f-0
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.120
Involvement is a different matter.

0a195b2a-cab4-4e0f-9297-17e839a399a6-0
00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.320
Where there is no involvement, there is no life.

c59d2827-8dfe-4452-ab25-2a4fefe26af1-0
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:28.600
Sadhguru.

f4caea1e-afce-40f7-9ef8-b858eda628b7-0
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.280
This is why people are walking like this on the street.

faf48544-58c3-4f31-acb6-b4bbdcefc3b1-0
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.240
I hope the cameras are showing.

39cf48d9-0d42-45cf-b1d7-3ffb813546f2-0
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.980
My hands also go home.

fea2c29f-d99f-4ddc-861f-28a4a41f8b6e-0
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.300
Suddenly you're in love.

a9141839-a5fb-4edf-9f85-62fb14e2ebe8-0
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.700
You think this is going to work and last for long.

2339030e-b6fa-45d5-a88b-5df5251749c2-0
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.986
You must practice on the street with the trees, with the sky,

2339030e-b6fa-45d5-a88b-5df5251749c2-1
00:33:52.986 --> 00:33:53.820
with the cloud.

0198d672-ae9a-4f0e-8c3e-b48e94e6393b-0
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.380
Can't you look at it lovingly?

75bc19af-fa10-44da-b37c-9f706e16757b-0
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.300
What's your problem?

a3c345ab-76df-438c-830b-53dc191d20eb-0
00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:57.620
Hello.

2ec550bd-9f2e-4a2a-baf5-efc24ea1f26d-0
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.300
Because love is not something that you do.

13b54455-97ca-4d01-acaf-eddffeb789af-0
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.460
Joy is not something that you do.

2e1de9e6-b28e-4eaa-913b-bad17d7c0d2c-0
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.660
Happiness is not something that you do.

03f3e567-daec-4d86-bb87-18411153e380-0
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.570
Peace is not something that you do.

7f88e809-2818-4587-85b9-2afe0bea052e-0
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.970
It is the way you are, isn't it?

ea6baa28-70ee-4550-9c7f-c0b5cfc31ff5-0
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.770
You cannot do these things.

552b90d0-5f36-4f07-a81c-b68ad1140227-0
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.850
But you can become these things.

a4d229f1-54a3-465e-b351-6445b945f052-0
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:18.763
You can become loving, you can become joyful, you can become

a4d229f1-54a3-465e-b351-6445b945f052-1
00:34:18.763 --> 00:34:20.610
peaceful, but you can't do it.

11c03621-a431-4dc2-80f0-0cbb8fcfb671-0
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:23.010
So what is action?

54fcf801-6b7c-473e-b8ae-a0d2d5d6d17b-0
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.850
What is the subjective nature of who you are?

fbfceccc-ee08-456c-bb82-0539efc8b952-0
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.490
These things have been all mixed up.

3c3f1729-3ae6-43db-be70-e7af27b32419-0
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:30.850
So Shambhavi means like this.

0c1fb0f9-2b2a-4c17-b214-806b8e38500d-0
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.130
If you sit here, your body is here.

2534cfcb-b4fc-42c6-b7ce-c9d835eda5a1-0
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.160
Your mind is chattering there.

8f3d3820-b145-43ab-adbf-35b2d922f165-0
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.680
You are little away.

8442dc8f-b238-4cf5-bc51-1506ce9a26a9-0
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.533
Once there is a distance between you and your body, between you

8442dc8f-b238-4cf5-bc51-1506ce9a26a9-1
00:34:43.533 --> 00:34:44.560
and your mind.

6d22db1c-7416-4b79-9a31-3512b9600419-0
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.002
This is the end of suffering, because these are the only two

6d22db1c-7416-4b79-9a31-3512b9600419-1
00:34:49.002 --> 00:34:52.240
types of suffering that you know in your life.

c77b5787-70fb-452c-8a61-d638a34935e4-0
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.840
Physical suffering, mental suffering.

a063f0fb-4d56-474a-b11d-9ed35b4c14df-0
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.720
Do you know any other kind of suffering?

7ed909e3-4800-41fb-b077-23f5667fedf3-0
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:58.680
Do you?

cb23fd34-f742-4fb4-bd24-90495c996cf9-0
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.960
I think last year, not
20/20/2019.

2f887363-c389-4904-9025-a9fc44257712-0
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.760
I think this this was on news.

1301e241-867d-4ce5-af0d-c8655041759f-0
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.495
Most of you might have seen this, a young woman in

1301e241-867d-4ce5-af0d-c8655041759f-1
00:35:12.495 --> 00:35:17.742
Hyderabad, some kind of a, some kind of a news anchor or

1301e241-867d-4ce5-af0d-c8655041759f-2
00:35:17.742 --> 00:35:20.320
something on the television.

2bf4cf8f-71cc-4022-8a8c-8e70c4c27d96-0
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.000
She was.

e02642d9-89bd-4b02-b649-44e9095328a6-0
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.827
One day she jumped off the 5th floor and she left a suicide

e02642d9-89bd-4b02-b649-44e9095328a6-1
00:35:27.827 --> 00:35:28.240
note.

a554a3a6-a9b4-427a-8882-296c89eb778b-0
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.560
I'm doing this.

bbadf886-9122-4870-b7c2-9cd149acf47d-0
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.680
Nobody is responsible.

b835a9e5-368d-4768-9b63-0b065d5f304e-0
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.120
My brain is my enemy.

30d7f7ca-ef15-4cb5-a80a-a73715fb1401-0
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.693
It took millions and millions of years to get your brain to this

30d7f7ca-ef15-4cb5-a80a-a73715fb1401-1
00:35:43.693 --> 00:35:45.560
bloody size and capability.

1499720e-c7d4-4266-8e88-3679d1ee7100-0
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.560
Hello.

f49d72ad-2ecf-4708-8f48-d7f4695d46df-0
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.040
Yes or no.

e3f8d906-5ef2-441e-89e0-3a0e8ed19757-0
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.760
But now this is your enemy.

e5953ee8-c468-492e-a8de-4d00577e958b-0
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760
You can't bear it.

dd25d2c3-dcac-4bcd-a5b4-7522f6e851a5-0
00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:01.010
So she took the ultimate step of killing herself.

b7fa6397-3956-4ed2-9e8c-f2ca7b27042c-0
00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:07.514
Many others are doing the same thing in installments, TCH

b7fa6397-3956-4ed2-9e8c-f2ca7b27042c-1
00:36:07.514 --> 00:36:13.519
happening or no when you were a child, anything willing to

b7fa6397-3956-4ed2-9e8c-f2ca7b27042c-2
00:36:13.519 --> 00:36:16.370
engage with anything slowly.

784b74e1-65e1-4b51-abe4-7200dc26c742-0
00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:25.503
You think you become smart if you deny yourself life and life

784b74e1-65e1-4b51-abe4-7200dc26c742-1
00:36:25.503 --> 00:36:26.130
process.

d21f6dce-9d68-43a6-a5d7-ab648eaaa633-0
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.300
Sadhguru, do you think you become smart or stupid?

412df338-2a5a-4741-b660-2d2f395cbc8d-0
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:29.980
Hello.

86310588-8308-4d4d-8aa0-c75cfe204560-0
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.740
When the only and only thing that you really possess is life.

cb712ac9-9b40-4e3e-ba17-ed7e322cdf4c-0
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.780
If you deny yourself all that, that is life.

942a4a51-9321-4979-8a86-1fce81aed88c-0
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.260
I don't know whether you're crazy or stupid, TCH.

de738cd3-9567-4b23-8c94-6df30bce7f59-0
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.220
I can tell you a little story.

cc728d6e-3600-4a8a-8bbe-19f484c17e08-0
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.300
This happened in Minnesota.

12823f93-c6e2-4818-92a7-37fc0c4f4530-0
00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.500
Sadhguru an evening.

42ec9419-480a-4423-ad80-2e67eda99ccd-0
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.020
A lady was driving for an evening party.

3ac456ae-3da1-4554-a34f-dfe2a25344dc-0
00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:05.420
I don't know, winter months, it's all snowed out.

777f9fb5-9285-4966-8c6d-2d105717cbd3-0
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.540
So she was driving and then she had a flat tire.

8899bd4e-8fb0-4cb9-85f2-e001f592e319-0
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.220
The tire went down.

5d531c72-7ed8-462e-aedb-f3b54709987b-0
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.860
She got down and looked.

82d06d39-971c-49c4-80e0-ca9e6054052a-0
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.400
She's been driving for many years, but it had never occurred

82d06d39-971c-49c4-80e0-ca9e6054052a-1
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.569
to her She should learn how to fix a tire, because such a thing

82d06d39-971c-49c4-80e0-ca9e6054052a-2
00:37:22.569 --> 00:37:24.500
never happened to her all these years.

21e84cac-b961-4b54-805e-25edfebb8997-0
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.250
Then she looked.

a819dc8b-d3db-4adb-b2f1-b3c59986cc94-0
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.610
She heard strange noises, She looked around.

0bd9c717-fc6c-46aa-8149-db447214ea35-0
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.890
She had popped right in front of a mental asylum.

a4ecbd92-1ca9-430e-9e57-4bf0994b1da9-0
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.810
Noises were happening and she was little scared.

045499a4-4877-415e-87ff-12db325683b7-0
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.850
So now she went into the glove compartment.

302e0cc4-fdfd-4a38-8595-d0d3d6dfd750-0
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:44.450
She pulled out her car manual and started looking.

263ef2c4-61e1-4d66-9dbd-cae30193bff0-0
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:45.570
Where is the Jack?

14f1f30f-8372-453f-a603-2ff7f45b9f52-0
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.890
Where is the spare tire?

a7a9b9be-b433-4c52-9891-42c73479b4e5-0
00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.130
How to get it out?

5bc6ab8a-10f2-4b7c-999c-e8b7c37d5033-0
00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:55.539
Took a while, got it out, then put the Jack, lifted the car,

5bc6ab8a-10f2-4b7c-999c-e8b7c37d5033-1
00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:59.390
took out the four nuts and there it was.

4a162dd3-58bd-40d3-a433-2120606e2973-0
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.990
Instructed.

bdaaf2b4-44da-47da-85df-8862835c3ce8-0
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.550
Don't put the nuts on the street.

96285b4b-e7a3-4c0b-a0e1-057f77227c34-0
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.270
You may lose them.

b0edf3b8-11e3-42a8-b1a4-6c6f0802a73d-0
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:03.350
Put it in the hubcap.

88ac4070-5166-4adc-b20c-2d7275404e2c-0
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.030
But she was going to a party.

185c5467-4499-4648-a073-cd6d00d77b56-0
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.190
She's in her party clothes.

85bb3194-b9c2-412a-89da-aac9e9484c5f-0
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.400
That means she can't sit, she can't stand, she can't do

85bb3194-b9c2-412a-89da-aac9e9484c5f-1
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.150
anything, you know.

cebbefe7-5aac-49f1-971a-9e169d6ede2f-0
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.150
See, ladies, understand this.

b97e4ae2-2b86-44aa-8173-0bb008c0c1c5-0
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.380
And she's on 6 inches heels.

787bd9aa-5bea-4179-b07c-67e3fe68f181-0
00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.576
So she's tottering around carrying this heavy wheel and

787bd9aa-5bea-4179-b07c-67e3fe68f181-1
00:38:24.576 --> 00:38:27.260
trying to do this and that in all this circus.

41fc1d94-6c24-418c-a8d1-24b99bca1d10-0
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:32.495
She stepped on the hubcap so these four nuts flew and flew in

41fc1d94-6c24-418c-a8d1-24b99bca1d10-1
00:38:32.495 --> 00:38:36.802
four different directions and fell in the snow and

41fc1d94-6c24-418c-a8d1-24b99bca1d10-2
00:38:36.802 --> 00:38:39.420
disappeared, as nuts always do.

43920001-b435-40c1-b0df-f78470a692dd-0
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.900
Then she stood there.

eae60764-cb38-463c-985c-8c67016c60e0-0
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.500
She got everything going.

e0419361-5a97-462b-80a1-de6f63412bad-0
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.680
She she got the spare wheel, put it there.

6d4f3a04-2c89-414d-9326-a9be37f32dcc-0
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.320
She put this wheel back in where it should be.

1b2cb50e-47c7-41f9-9d96-b408b7b6128d-0
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.560
But now she doesn't have the nuts, not knowing what to do.

2b0350b0-6aac-42e6-abf1-0c7f5393f6be-0
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.360
Stood there dejected.

d1541842-7291-40d4-9cd3-54b37403f8af-0
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.456
There was a young man standing on the third floor of the mental

d1541842-7291-40d4-9cd3-54b37403f8af-1
00:39:02.456 --> 00:39:04.040
asylum, he said, Hey lady.

da11ad29-b880-46b1-a939-5fed0a7440bf-0
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.360
She got terrified.

b409bab5-4d18-4da8-ab6c-59495000dcb5-0
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:07.960
She looked at him.

6c6f8580-28a3-4b06-b8c2-d813a9f625ce-0
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.880
There was a 20 foot wall.

62530caa-5b19-4beb-8c6b-e5fddd02201c-0
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:10.760
She was safe.

5a9ec25d-7e83-4944-a934-0fe89f887386-0
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.427
But you know, she said just take out one one nut from all the

5a9ec25d-7e83-4944-a934-0fe89f887386-1
00:39:15.427 --> 00:39:19.567
other three wheels and put it you can drive to the gas

5a9ec25d-7e83-4944-a934-0fe89f887386-2
00:39:19.567 --> 00:39:20.170
station.

434c253a-a842-43a9-891d-54b1ef66713b-0
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.170
She did just that.

a9307582-83a1-4eee-94dc-cf1e4a785b01-0
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.443
Then, wiping her hands clean, she looked at him very

a9307582-83a1-4eee-94dc-cf1e4a785b01-1
00:39:27.443 --> 00:39:31.879
gratefully and said, you're such a smart young man, why are you

a9307582-83a1-4eee-94dc-cf1e4a785b01-2
00:39:31.879 --> 00:39:32.850
in this place?

043a0920-0c23-4a8f-8c5a-fc50440dcb25-0
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:35.690
He said.

0121b185-4cb1-4a06-bb1a-97b04cbaa739-0
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:42.248
I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid like you sadhguru, you

0121b185-4cb1-4a06-bb1a-97b04cbaa739-1
00:39:42.248 --> 00:39:44.690
must make up your mind.

a8f70279-e81b-486e-ab89-06cb26cb140f-0
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.450
Are you crazy or stupid?

d8e2f1f0-a7a6-4855-af36-99e10d257474-0
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:52.410
Because when both joy and misery can only happen from within.

a4798bde-ccdf-4788-98f5-5c7fd4d6dc7e-0
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:56.580
If you are causing misery to yourself, you must decide which

a4798bde-ccdf-4788-98f5-5c7fd4d6dc7e-1
00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.330
one you are.

9a34d0bc-50a4-40d0-aa76-02752507e892-0
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.410
Hello.

6a8d8632-80d4-4100-92d1-ef7a1e75ebd7-0
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.650
Yes or no, somebody can Causeway physical pain.

5ed88604-3728-4713-af01-177949497475-0
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.530
To us such a thing happens.

b18aa0d7-43ff-4f08-ae86-9fa52595b3ae-0
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.330
We should know what to do in the world.

efa4e4f9-3289-4cd0-becd-6b441f1c85ff-0
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.820
We'll move away.

2b38291a-ddc8-434d-b856-23fff734b177-0
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.580
We'll handle it.

7f57f6a0-deb7-43d5-95e2-f9f7a566bbde-0
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.260
We'll deal with it.

a532d4b8-c332-498d-87a4-693462b98917-0
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.020
We'll do something.

8aa250d2-05ee-4931-8f68-e9b889cf6a6a-0
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.260
But you're poking from inside yourself.

fb3e61be-fde8-4f03-bfb3-e380dbbb79c8-0
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.420
You must be either crazy or stupid.

2a38c2e6-85d9-41ba-8a6a-a1d07ca13110-0
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.820
Maybe both.

d05bd177-17a2-4811-9dd3-df849283281b-0
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.980
Maybe you're a double graduate in India.

75382277-908a-4b04-807e-808461ef4dee-0
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.140
It used to be a proud thing.

b9813be1-9905-4b18-86a3-418151febde7-0
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.915
I'm a double graduate, so it kind of so irritated me, this

b9813be1-9905-4b18-86a3-418151febde7-1
00:40:32.915 --> 00:40:35.340
whole double graduate business.

042c536a-b49e-4975-b178-759f9073fa60-0
00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.823
When I graduated, when my exams were over and I'm supposed to,

042c536a-b49e-4975-b178-759f9073fa60-1
00:40:39.823 --> 00:40:43.867
you know, they declared that I
got the second highest marks in

042c536a-b49e-4975-b178-759f9073fa60-2
00:40:43.867 --> 00:40:44.830
the university.

58f920f8-6866-49b7-ad9f-df7b91119e4a-0
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:45.390
Whatever.

9ecdb22a-8b85-40dc-800d-eada1a383347-0
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.710
I refused to go and collect my graduation certificate.

9afda802-5ac5-4521-97af-157e6b7d6d15-0
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.870
My father was in the Senate of the university.

3223c65d-f272-4384-ad14-5ce6aa7870b9-0
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.430
He said this is the height of irresponsibility.

65d8fb40-12de-4b23-a7e0-d2665fcf544d-0
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.590
How can you not collect your graduation certificate?

6dbc4931-dc1f-4814-b440-d3e96f19823d-0
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.595
I said no, I don't want to collect it because I don't never

6dbc4931-dc1f-4814-b440-d3e96f19823d-1
00:41:00.595 --> 00:41:02.230
want to flash it and say I am this.

114878d1-804f-400e-8434-945f10834622-0
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:04.990
I never collected that till now.

f853717b-56f5-4c9a-9ad0-9231a439f7ac-0
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:56.407
Why I am saying this to you is we these are the only two two

f853717b-56f5-4c9a-9ad0-9231a439f7ac-1
00:41:56.407 --> 00:42:13.420
things that you have.

da24779f-0910-4612-9deb-55f936dba5c2-0
00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.667
Do not confuse yourself with all the devices that you, you know,

da24779f-0910-4612-9deb-55f936dba5c2-1
00:42:17.667 --> 00:42:20.020
set up to Causeway this experience.

703e12f0-5e35-4065-9d1c-dc1caa1b85f6-0
00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:25.092
I am telling you when it comes to inner experience because it's

703e12f0-5e35-4065-9d1c-dc1caa1b85f6-1
00:42:25.092 --> 00:42:26.980
entirely within yourself.

94679da6-537f-4d23-afc1-d09adcb3d142-0
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:32.866
What arrangements that you make around is only for convenience,

94679da6-537f-4d23-afc1-d09adcb3d142-1
00:42:32.866 --> 00:42:37.403
only for convenience, so that nobody disturbs your way of

94679da6-537f-4d23-afc1-d09adcb3d142-2
00:42:37.403 --> 00:42:38.420
experiencing.

13e5460a-72a0-4fb3-ae19-2f4c64e2d554-0
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.883
When it comes to impact, you want to Causeway big impact

13e5460a-72a0-4fb3-ae19-2f4c64e2d554-1
00:42:42.883 --> 00:42:47.216
Where you live, whether it's your family or your community or

13e5460a-72a0-4fb3-ae19-2f4c64e2d554-2
00:42:47.216 --> 00:42:51.620
your nation or the world, then you have to it's a transaction.

05c1128e-ea2a-45fe-8201-5f705f2348f3-0
00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.980
You have to enhance your skills, you have to do things.

e65bb601-55b3-48ba-b535-d7ac46ec096d-0
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.913
But to live here with a profound sense of experience, you don't

e65bb601-55b3-48ba-b535-d7ac46ec096d-1
00:42:58.913 --> 00:43:00.700
need other people's cooperation.

d3ea6c9c-6d7f-470a-85e4-a9ce24f123ba-0
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.460
Hmm Yes or no to create impact.

5903019d-532c-447a-8211-ac0260957ba6-0
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.259
You need other people's cooperation to Causeway a

5903019d-532c-447a-8211-ac0260957ba6-1
00:43:07.259 --> 00:43:10.338
profound experience here
Sadhguru Do you need somebody

5903019d-532c-447a-8211-ac0260957ba6-2
00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:11.010
else's help?

db8ff01f-4146-45b4-a595-dbc936500ae2-0
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.930
Should your father or mother hold your hand and walk you?

11622438-23c8-4694-9204-973c421ce740-0
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:16.010
No.

3006b744-bd7b-4783-9934-278bcede1a52-0
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.650
Once they made a lifeout of you, their business is over.

d037e454-5a79-4152-abee-29763ba8c5c0-0
00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:23.908
Causing the profoundness of experience is entirely your

d037e454-5a79-4152-abee-29763ba8c5c0-1
00:43:23.908 --> 00:43:24.490
business.

02f19e26-54ca-430b-be51-3609a72c4f40-0
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.567
If you want to Causeway impact in the world, then you have to

02f19e26-54ca-430b-be51-3609a72c4f40-1
00:43:28.567 --> 00:43:31.370
make associations and transactions of various kinds.

67f1b9b9-fb11-41a8-a329-63afacffcbaa-0
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.770
Depending on your skills, that much impact may happen.

e744fc7d-c860-48e1-bf9f-be8e1b047921-0
00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.051
So right now we are talking about profoundness of

e744fc7d-c860-48e1-bf9f-be8e1b047921-1
00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:40.730
experience.

10d64003-d6a0-4154-b0e6-ada6153aca71-0
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.792
I also want you to look at this without a profound experience of

10d64003-d6a0-4154-b0e6-ada6153aca71-1
00:43:44.792 --> 00:43:45.090
life.

cdba6c65-f533-46ae-a105-19c857c606fa-0
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.978
Do you believe that you can
Causeway a massive impact in the

cdba6c65-f533-46ae-a105-19c857c606fa-1
00:43:48.978 --> 00:43:49.330
world?

1cee4296-dee1-4629-80b5-db42e24a45be-0
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:50.970
Hmm.

ac2686ff-fbfa-4456-9c23-26b789447f8d-0
00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.302
If you want to create something in the world, there must be some

ac2686ff-fbfa-4456-9c23-26b789447f8d-1
00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:58.170
profoundness of experience about something, isn't it?

6ab090eb-9328-4d3d-9c94-5731430e76b2-0
00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:02.450
Yes or no need not necessarily be a spiritual dimension.

098e7ed0-14f4-47cb-8160-3d4ec5af5b2a-0
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:07.420
You must have some profoundness of experience about something.

d94711df-ccf7-435e-a2d2-f1769a15262f-0
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.900
Only then you can make some impact happen, isn't it?

e4ab6c02-a61c-4c3d-9a08-d47135d292a5-0
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.140
So that is a secondary aspect of life.

4067167a-32dc-4151-af1f-92b213e3847a-0
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.235
This is the primary aspect of life, that profoundness of

4067167a-32dc-4151-af1f-92b213e3847a-1
00:44:18.235 --> 00:44:18.980
experience.

9b43e6ec-f58e-4a77-a1a0-f1eea51e6c62-0
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:23.408
If profoundness of experience has to happen, the physical and

9b43e6ec-f58e-4a77-a1a0-f1eea51e6c62-1
00:44:23.408 --> 00:44:27.500
mental strictures that you have created have to be relaxed.

b4ea1b64-2631-4231-b7d2-aaec1eb38929-0
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.945
So Shambhavi is this, that you create a little distance between

b4ea1b64-2631-4231-b7d2-aaec1eb38929-1
00:44:31.945 --> 00:44:34.700
you and the body, between you and the mind.

d9362618-8ebb-4e98-9ac8-5dc3ffc3b00d-0
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.010
Sadhguru, all your troubles are just on these two platforms.

9a04bd16-7292-4e90-a6e9-093d2d571a26-0
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.410
Physical platform, mental platform, isn't it?

63f16e42-1add-4030-b599-c23c78390a8f-0
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.410
There's no other trouble in your life.

b279eb24-5625-4bdc-ba0f-16900abd3aba-0
00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:50.578
So even today, first time when you do also there may be moments

b279eb24-5625-4bdc-ba0f-16900abd3aba-1
00:44:50.578 --> 00:44:54.826
when you and your body are little away, but the moment you

b279eb24-5625-4bdc-ba0f-16900abd3aba-2
00:44:54.826 --> 00:44:57.850
open your eyes, you're stuck in it again.

c2e2925e-89d6-478f-9395-9c373e1b5b0c-0
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.530
You think you can shake yourself out of it?

030af88d-adc0-41be-98fe-9e4833941187-0
00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:01.330
Try and see.

bc50c9e1-df1a-48cd-95e3-fa4c02445b7c-0
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.090
Hello sadhguru.

c971c3bd-3661-4703-9527-44e64cde1b83-0
00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:05.810
If you try really hard, you think it'll come out.

542e5b4d-5180-4bcc-8c1f-16bf83b0cc5a-0
00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.250
No, it's not like that.

cec58ec9-a5af-4531-8eec-27e132b55403-0
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:14.364
If you do the right things immediately there will be a

cec58ec9-a5af-4531-8eec-27e132b55403-1
00:45:14.364 --> 00:45:14.770
space.

d7e21646-430a-4aec-9d8f-afc9014b2e11-0
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.290
But you open your eyes again.

8593aaf7-677b-4def-ac69-60df489c7885-0
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:16.770
It's stuck.

eea87ce1-d784-4ed3-8cf0-d11ae27e4fc2-0
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.610
Every day, every day, morning, evening, morning, evening.

80f146b6-8a72-46e9-97e2-5c0a8ba7b283-0
00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:20.450
Shambhavi, Shambhavi.

e8434a0e-e4b0-460c-9975-59f2074430ed-0
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:21.530
Shambhavi is happening.

a6f4e4d0-e443-44e8-b5c9-23fced239016-0
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:26.303
One day comes when you open your eyes, still body is here, mind

a6f4e4d0-e443-44e8-b5c9-23fced239016-1
00:45:26.303 --> 00:45:26.930
is there.

ef03c539-6693-4a07-bae3-ba375dec4bac-0
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:28.330
What is you is little away.

af1c3e09-1393-4730-8a76-9b0f3525a2a4-0
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.690
Once this happens, this is the end of suffering.

41db393e-2fb7-4d23-8d26-68aeb3f562f0-0
00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:35.540
Absolutely, because suffering happens only on these two

41db393e-2fb7-4d23-8d26-68aeb3f562f0-1
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.910
platforms, which are physical and psychological.

5ef28ef0-afd9-4f82-a0bf-693d3e5e2fcc-0
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.389
There is simply no other kind of suffering, you know, Some people

5ef28ef0-afd9-4f82-a0bf-693d3e5e2fcc-1
00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:45.230
will say no, my soul is crying.

0b24634c-b137-4ffd-b84d-150a422f29fc-0
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:51.270
Maybe they got a thorn in the foot because of that.

822f9990-332f-417d-b860-4b3ebb434e47-0
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.590
Their one of their souls may be crying.

b88af4aa-9d4f-4760-8d2b-d138dbddab0d-0
00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:00.820
You know pain only physically and mentally.

e2c95085-c504-468f-a2e6-02870f9775f6-0
00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.020
You know suffering only mentally, not even physically.

f20611e3-556b-4f1b-80da-2484a8bb5557-0
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.660
You know pain physically.

9bd38969-4c5d-44b5-8952-259d5554388a-0
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.060
You know suffering mentally.

e548cdf6-0fac-4e63-8977-6b1d9fc6ddcd-0
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.220
You do not know any other unpleasantness within you.

dcfc6c5f-0771-470d-a0e9-9b141c46f859-0
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:12.740
Isn't it?

b829efb5-95b6-4f1f-bdc8-c5e10644df76-0
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:12.980
So?

5b63be4a-c04c-4f1d-87c1-512871d8079b-0
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.060
Hello.

995438ef-aab8-44c4-a6a5-3caec688c105-0
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.082
You have never experienced any other sense of unpleasantness

995438ef-aab8-44c4-a6a5-3caec688c105-1
00:46:19.082 --> 00:46:23.224
within you except physical pain and mental turmoils that you

995438ef-aab8-44c4-a6a5-3caec688c105-2
00:46:23.224 --> 00:46:23.700
create.

d36c5631-48f0-410e-96a8-a893637a6909-0
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:32.792
So Shambhavi as a process has been happening for thousands of

d36c5631-48f0-410e-96a8-a893637a6909-1
00:46:32.792 --> 00:46:38.678
years but it always happened in the intimacy between a guru and

d36c5631-48f0-410e-96a8-a893637a6909-2
00:46:38.678 --> 00:46:39.690
a disciple.

74e95402-2f76-4c9a-ac67-5df85dd4c643-0
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:45.450
Why this is so is there are many aspects to it.

2a0ff6e5-bbf8-442a-a091-12d6a4a5cf0d-0
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:49.676
One important aspect why it was always curtailed is there is a

2a0ff6e5-bbf8-442a-a091-12d6a4a5cf0d-1
00:46:49.676 --> 00:46:51.220
dimension to Shambhavi.

59457d12-94fe-418d-bbff-0f5ea3fb47e4-0
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.654
There is a spiritual dimension, there is a psychological

59457d12-94fe-418d-bbff-0f5ea3fb47e4-1
00:46:54.654 --> 00:46:57.727
dimension, there is a physiological transformative

59457d12-94fe-418d-bbff-0f5ea3fb47e4-2
00:46:57.727 --> 00:47:00.740
dimension, but there is also an occult dimension.

e10b7c7d-0ff5-4d21-b8a6-9a8a1e5094f6-0
00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.610
Occult means, you know, in this country you call it black magic

e10b7c7d-0ff5-4d21-b8a6-9a8a1e5094f6-1
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.420
and various other things in different languages.

54c6591a-329b-4ee9-8264-490fad8abc0d-0
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.580
They have different names.

504a471a-cd25-4475-af21-6de27fcd279e-0
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:14.075
Essentially, it's about using one's energies to Causeway

504a471a-cd25-4475-af21-6de27fcd279e-1
00:47:14.075 --> 00:47:18.660
detriment to somebody, your own advantage and somebody else's

504a471a-cd25-4475-af21-6de27fcd279e-2
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.400
detriment.

6f97b5de-6319-4061-96dc-2cb5f756c100-0
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.480
Ah, there is a whole thing you that used to go on.

75572725-d6ea-4e06-a970-de40b3c8dc30-0
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:28.840
It's considerably come down in the world today because of that.

f6cbc850-613b-4d5c-987c-f91176586ed0-0
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.550
It was always contained, never opened up to the public because

f6cbc850-613b-4d5c-987c-f91176586ed0-1
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:34.680
people may misuse it.

e8f7b4de-7d51-4603-a61c-e780339e2f67-0
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.231
Suppose you had powers like this that if you just look at like

e8f7b4de-7d51-4603-a61c-e780339e2f67-1
00:47:39.231 --> 00:47:40.600
this, she'll get zapped.

cc3cf7f2-9d2f-468a-85e6-92e4d2a4089a-0
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.320
She's finished.

414381c6-9445-4a3b-adee-eeefb299eb10-0
00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.840
She'll burn into ashes.

dc2e8205-8d61-4c40-baee-d9722b423d0e-0
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.680
Sadhguru, this would be a little dangerous.

c45f4027-d251-4ff7-bd7f-4e4479992629-0
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.520
One day you got angry with your husband pH.

19c1dc14-4348-4244-9a61-b03b367d272d-0
00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.840
When he becomes ashes you will cry.

874ad38d-82e9-41b2-a991-a0ecd057f744-0
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.840
You may do this to your own child.

786f6484-10bd-412d-a7c9-53219231efb7-0
00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.840
You may do this to yourself.

becf7c3b-e2d8-4c67-a791-fc4722257498-0
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.280
Hello.

a2dc288f-3c38-4448-bf49-321383d59930-0
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.600
You heard of the story of Basma
Sura?

1e579b44-7f82-4ef1-8051-02092a5245b8-0
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.080
TCH.

ce0e8e07-d500-497e-9e9b-5160554e8961-0
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.520
There was one.

a410162a-de75-457c-ad03-c71420b20512-0
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.400
Whatever.

fa457318-8759-49e9-aea3-5de0e59ff341-0
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.720
He did all kinds of sadhana.

4564083d-12e5-4e67-8ed3-c2555363c410-0
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.160
He went to Shiva and said I want a boon from you.

50a4cf7c-2fb5-40cb-81b7-2d057e9e1d87-0
00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.460
Shiva was in a giving mood.

9a053c86-8e3f-4f70-8deb-ead02790c235-0
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.180
He said OK what do you want?

c4eba0be-ea7f-4174-9890-b147dc9f78ec-0
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.890
He said whoever I place my hand upon, they must become burn into

c4eba0be-ea7f-4174-9890-b147dc9f78ec-1
00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:26.300
ashes.

00a38765-f342-4a91-9d98-611fa80ad75f-0
00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:32.556
Shiva said OK that guy wants to try so he comes to place the

00a38765-f342-4a91-9d98-611fa80ad75f-1
00:48:32.556 --> 00:48:34.380
hand on Shiva's head.

394b8608-2814-4c07-bf9f-242f06ee5e34-0
00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.340
Shiva says what?

98dc3768-36a6-4ced-af45-749162e85f85-0
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.580
No, I want to try whether you will burn into ashes or not.

c60521bc-868a-4374-b1a2-4bd7a652f861-0
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.270
Then something something happens.

51921a03-6a06-40a5-8b83-a50a26cddbd4-0
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:52.590
Then whatever.

fbecbe59-f8fd-42d6-b6be-f86e5f2953ac-0
00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:53.750
The story goes like this.

7f783fe0-6dd2-4f75-b025-b6310f06d82a-0
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:58.504
Vishnu comes, becomes Mohini and that guy gets enamored by that

7f783fe0-6dd2-4f75-b025-b6310f06d82a-1
00:48:58.504 --> 00:48:58.950
woman.

995728ee-3100-4094-b436-207f23ce13f0-0
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:02.169
Then she starts dancing, dancing, dancing various

995728ee-3100-4094-b436-207f23ce13f0-1
00:49:02.169 --> 00:49:02.670
postures.

978d48a4-a531-45b9-8b4b-e0040f192163-0
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:03.270
Can you do this?

124aa3a2-b3ab-4f44-9f8d-2c800dea1c68-0
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.830
Can you do this?

8e8defcd-cde9-44e3-bf62-374476c7a0c0-0
00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:04.470
Can you do this?

84df3876-3c08-44af-88b9-f2fbb94f13f9-0
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:05.550
Can you do this?

a4e981e3-b764-476e-beb2-4cd5559d8350-0
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:06.390
He did.

3a05f7e2-e5ee-46ae-913a-643faa42a69a-0
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:31.930
And A2 celled animal, not one.

0a4e830f-1eba-4ebd-99c7-4fbea6d25a21-0
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.090
You think an amoeba doesn't have this desire.

0c970415-840a-42e3-9bd1-a2e8a16ab3a8-0
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:35.890
It has.

32a2465c-c67d-46d3-b884-1b8f7e4cd2b3-0
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.610
That's why it's trying to expand.

0b275fe8-ecfc-4c8d-9361-92d8ceff30c7-0
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.130
Two cells happened.

3c107bb4-d22c-43b0-8237-926f71c69add-0
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.330
Then you said I want 10 that happened.

037c9eb2-6595-4f53-bc70-9cc8b0818c32-0
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:42.810
Million that happened.

05b5c32f-7251-4d65-88e7-59adeddc41ba-0
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.210
Then I said they want more.

63e71d87-9f8a-4b67-a97b-6885504656cc-0
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:47.010
More capability, more capability, more capability.

b7c4abaf-b6c0-4413-b7eb-e3be434c6d9c-0
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:51.274
Then this whole cerebral cortex blossomed and became this big

b7c4abaf-b6c0-4413-b7eb-e3be434c6d9c-1
00:49:51.274 --> 00:49:54.997
that it's came up capable of tremendous amount of memory and

b7c4abaf-b6c0-4413-b7eb-e3be434c6d9c-2
00:49:54.997 --> 00:49:55.730
imagination.

002eb67f-4fe8-4684-a2f4-4ea9296ef1d3-0
00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:00.576
Oh, now you are like this every day hitting yourself on the

002eb67f-4fe8-4684-a2f4-4ea9296ef1d3-1
00:50:00.576 --> 00:50:00.960
head.

0f3fb11f-e1ee-4a08-b98d-ce401d9f55bd-0
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.320
If we remove half your brain, I
think you will be very peaceful.

58b8ae4b-132d-42f4-a71c-e3ce566ae6a2-0
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.040
What do you think?

4eb21f64-9aa3-451a-9bb2-9a6145542f51-0
00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.160
Yes, you will be.

5b1cbca3-1f52-47e9-a009-11cff2afccf6-0
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.000
But if you remove the possibility, the problem also

5b1cbca3-1f52-47e9-a009-11cff2afccf6-1
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:16.760
will be gone.

334ebd91-acab-465a-a033-6703548c799a-0
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.840
Everybody knows that.

b938a0a0-a4b4-424a-bb1e-47eaeba77e41-0
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.480
But that is not the point.

b60c5745-cb4c-4bb9-aa84-c8a5f944ecea-0
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:33.468
To enhance the possibility and take the from a little single

b60c5745-cb4c-4bb9-aa84-c8a5f944ecea-1
00:50:33.468 --> 00:50:45.189
celled creature, we asked for more capability, more

b60c5745-cb4c-4bb9-aa84-c8a5f944ecea-2
00:50:45.189 --> 00:50:51.500
capability, more capability.

efa7c6c8-c6b7-45c6-9a55-f21d41cc4cac-0
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.140
You came to this level of capability.

8a68a1dc-6244-4581-882b-2e2d06349c16-0
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:07.912
I walk on the street like a lover, always with anything and

8a68a1dc-6244-4581-882b-2e2d06349c16-1
00:51:07.912 --> 00:51:08.700
everything.

08a6313b-f124-4155-8e8b-7c50f14cf082-0
00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:09.740
Hello.

b3fde36f-40b1-4c02-9cb6-cad102ec33c3-0
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.580
You can't stop me.

51728122-e279-43b8-80f3-b615a2c6d9c0-0
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.160
Hello.

9ce3c394-bc99-492e-a8cf-ea30af8ab9a0-0
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.440
You can't stop me.

b6291fe1-bfbd-4203-a178-da533153e982-0
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.320
Because it is not a transaction.

631951d0-609f-4f89-bb7e-51de5041b40d-0
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.040
It's the way you are who can stop you.

367e9b55-3586-49ff-a2ac-2fbcaee29b12-0
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:30.480
So if you understand this now, we can wave off the 12 years.

e77c0b67-c6b1-4de8-8d67-475c1d06f40e-0
00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.280
Shall I?

388363e1-754c-483f-810c-0f33058197b0-0
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.606
Or shall I keep you for 12 years and say sweep the floor, wash

388363e1-754c-483f-810c-0f33058197b0-1
00:51:37.606 --> 00:51:39.400
the vessels, do this, do that.

fd8f017a-9e10-40c2-9788-bcba453605bb-0
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.570
Then we will see one day all this is to wear you down.

54731bb2-cc38-465f-9f02-034efb883026-0
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.890
If you really sit here as mother to the world number.

3f3d64a3-c837-413e-8664-5b7b2acc2f0d-0
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.250
Need to do all that stuff.

2387b63a-ec31-4b40-b7ea-273d8d42e3a5-0
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:50.490
Hmm.

e6c3acd2-0412-4d44-99af-6e5be4d4bd20-0
00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.010
You ready?

b78bc1e1-7409-494b-9328-204389988b8a-0
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.490
This has been this sambhavi.

3a7051e2-c763-4cbb-9c53-0c9ba094afd2-0
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:07.655
Initiation day has been a turning point in millions and

3a7051e2-c763-4cbb-9c53-0c9ba094afd2-1
00:52:07.655 --> 00:52:09.690
millions of lives across the world.

a25d503f-b97f-43f6-bf23-9f7273b54d6f-0
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.640
It's my wish and my blessing.

2e8260c6-be35-4fe6-8e20-fbbba0f8b957-0
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.600
It must be so for you also.

2847f324-d973-484a-b6a6-bf67505cee55-0
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.600
This needs to approach with a little bit of sensitivity.

260124ae-c138-4a24-89e6-16109a4fef6d-0
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.610
It's in a seed form right now.

c21536e2-3f4e-4307-95e8-fae345566642-0
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:36.410
The way we offer it you is in a seed form.

92117548-3cd8-4f2a-a6db-5fec8ecba571-0
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.930
Seed is not an exciting thing.

a32357a5-7a96-4cf4-80d0-63c814618487-0
00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.010
It looks dumb, uninteresting.

f0827d70-34d8-4fcd-9560-9fc71b9cd1f9-0
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.202
If I show you, suppose you don't know the relationship between a

f0827d70-34d8-4fcd-9560-9fc71b9cd1f9-1
00:52:45.202 --> 00:52:45.890
seed and a tree.

a3aa3c17-8330-4f84-8232-36dc4cf8dd40-0
00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.383
Sadhguru, if I show you this big thing and say see you go and

a3aa3c17-8330-4f84-8232-36dc4cf8dd40-1
00:52:49.383 --> 00:52:52.060
plant this in your back backyard, it will become a huge

a3aa3c17-8330-4f84-8232-36dc4cf8dd40-2
00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:52.300
tree.

71be1dd4-635e-48c8-8dfe-e7d90951cd44-0
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.380
You see the tree that came like this?

1e964628-6098-454a-8fff-6ef8bedbf2b1-0
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:59.473
Only Sir, rubbish Is you trying to con me that big tree came

1e964628-6098-454a-8fff-6ef8bedbf2b1-1
00:52:59.473 --> 00:53:01.060
from this nonsense.

03411c49-bc62-4337-9189-921c264bc0ad-0
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:05.020
You think you can perform a miracle, but that?

ff9df86d-ef0d-486c-bb9c-a817871a5b6e-0
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.820
I asked that guy with a volunteer who was there.

7d96c09c-af6c-4473-a96b-221dec7ae052-0
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.220
Well, have you been to all these places and come?

9f817f3c-09e3-4e06-88ee-4548af1cd2c2-0
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.835
He looked at me like this, as if
I'm asking something very not

9f817f3c-09e3-4e06-88ee-4548af1cd2c2-1
00:54:24.835 --> 00:54:25.100
nice.

1a68fc16-16ad-4797-b219-56b0fb8ad254-0
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:26.140
I said.

72486f0f-f874-4feb-b2a0-e171d9095761-0
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.760
Well, all this somebody, at least your teacher, your guru,

72486f0f-f874-4feb-b2a0-e171d9095761-1
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.100
must have been there to know all this.

d725ff9d-5d98-4a7f-ad2e-08c54df4f055-0
00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.420
No, my guru has attend, I said.

fa332cf5-e9ec-4ce4-a9d4-3b5a4c12c2d6-0
00:54:34.420 --> 00:55:28.210
That is, it's fine.

c581b7ea-1dd5-4b77-b88d-189ae0989a9d-0
00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:32.570
But he must have visited all these things.

1f3a5c67-51bd-4ca6-b4cd-445009e5dd6d-0
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:36.547
Otherwise how would he know what punishment will give you what

1f3a5c67-51bd-4ca6-b4cd-445009e5dd6d-1
00:55:36.547 --> 00:55:37.810
kind of temperature?

4878430a-5e64-4650-90dc-e442f4080f9b-0
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:46.714
Well, let's do it in a way that we should deal with human

4878430a-5e64-4650-90dc-e442f4080f9b-1
00:55:46.714 --> 00:55:47.330
beings.

c2541ce5-2b0a-4704-a1b9-bd0830caab01-0
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:52.268
Human being means we did not call anybody else a being on

c2541ce5-2b0a-4704-a1b9-bd0830caab01-1
00:55:52.268 --> 00:55:53.290
this planet.

debc9741-6661-4fb1-9d2c-f75bcf3071cb-0
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.620
No elephant beings, tiger beings, Ant beings, grasshopper

debc9741-6661-4fb1-9d2c-f75bcf3071cb-1
00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.090
beings.

aee6fea1-040b-4d9a-991c-0d2bda502f41-0
00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:04.698
No, only human is being because if you are willing, you know how

aee6fea1-040b-4d9a-991c-0d2bda502f41-1
00:56:04.698 --> 00:56:05.290
to be.

a4677bac-3a89-4c83-8af6-73ff9afd966f-0
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:08.890
Others do not know how to be.

d8648a52-85f8-4e9e-b2cb-6299a53158ac-0
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:12.506
They can only go by their natural compulsions, instincts,

d8648a52-85f8-4e9e-b2cb-6299a53158ac-1
00:56:12.506 --> 00:56:15.010
and compulsive reactions to what there is.

a407a93f-3fee-47f3-abe2-60602f0b73be-0
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.090
You are supposed to know how to be TCH.

1e3d370f-4beb-410c-9767-ba76e5ef62c8-0
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:22.450
Should we waste that on you?

47ac7c04-9a24-4eba-9d7f-e1493297c953-0
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.240
It should not go waste on us, isn't it?

59b9be9e-de61-408d-8f07-699d59fe1027-0
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.040
We should know how to be.

c1b132ed-f1e3-4112-b16c-67251723b3cc-0
00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.388
If you want to know how to be, you need a little bit of freedom

c1b132ed-f1e3-4112-b16c-67251723b3cc-1
00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:35.266
from the compulsions of your physiological process, from the

c1b132ed-f1e3-4112-b16c-67251723b3cc-2
00:56:35.266 --> 00:56:37.999
compulsions of your psychological process.

0c79fb86-798d-4505-8dd2-671be8e383d2-0
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.080
And that is what Shambhavi means.

eed02f70-c65f-43e1-a080-7978758fc96e-0
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.597
A twilight zone where your feet are firmly on the ground but

eed02f70-c65f-43e1-a080-7978758fc96e-1
00:56:44.597 --> 00:56:46.280
your head is in the sky.

514b4ba5-6f02-463e-a182-a9fcecf7b367-0
00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.800
Did you know your head is actually in the sky?

e240d770-de2b-4d95-b26a-a1125004794c-0
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:57.104
If an Ant is looking up from its height, it is looking at you and

e240d770-de2b-4d95-b26a-a1125004794c-1
00:56:57.104 --> 00:56:59.370
looking that your head is in the sky.

49c2e2b6-fb65-4833-a488-1ca20832cd2e-0
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:00.210
Yes or no?

3813eaa4-6546-44c5-99dd-9a37a3aa00fd-0
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.450
Hello.

0162822c-dbaf-484d-bb3a-388b802fc760-0
00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:03.410
Hello.

8a5a58ae-9a5c-4d89-988a-eb3af577c73a-0
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:06.370
Your head is actually in the sky.

902df128-0933-4b27-9852-06ffb07800a5-0
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:06.850
Yes or no?

7ec40e24-8e64-4ecd-8bec-05337c09ef90-0
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:10.997
TCH, see, if you look at a tall mountain peak, you think it's

7ec40e24-8e64-4ecd-8bec-05337c09ef90-1
00:57:10.997 --> 00:57:14.810
touching the sky because the clouds are swirling around.

43fb3a82-0622-40a2-8b12-26199d4d1cbe-0
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:22.279
Your head is also in the sky, but you are behaving like a worm

43fb3a82-0622-40a2-8b12-26199d4d1cbe-1
00:57:22.279 --> 00:57:27.056
crawling through the earth, your feet on the ground, head in the

43fb3a82-0622-40a2-8b12-26199d4d1cbe-2
00:57:27.056 --> 00:57:27.350
sky.

310e195e-2152-4029-84cd-11a07d55a84a-0
00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:29.430
This is the reality of a human being.

b19083dd-efb1-44ef-a28b-3fb2add0b0e5-0
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.510
That is the significance of being a human being.

206ce47f-cc8f-497a-8ba8-00080ac5ef37-0
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:37.070
So we will go through a very simple process right now.

770b5e4f-71b7-4b6d-8244-6a8f1c729667-0
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.150
All this you have already done in pieces.

94f923b2-9290-4950-9df2-4805718a70e8-0
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:45.990
We have to assemble it now, put it together and make it happen.

e81a8523-48c3-4ba6-b3f3-934d80a721ec-0
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:53.447
As I said, this used to happen only in utmost intimacy with the

e81a8523-48c3-4ba6-b3f3-934d80a721ec-1
00:57:53.447 --> 00:57:53.930
guru.

dd1182d0-29f5-46a7-bf30-aa46a7f38f05-0
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:59.351
When I use the word intimacy, most people in today's world

dd1182d0-29f5-46a7-bf30-aa46a7f38f05-1
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:03.450
understand intimacy AS2 bodies rubbing each other.

ff18144d-8e34-4da3-80c2-7f4c1ea5458b-0
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:11.458
See, I'm asking you simple questions without, you know,

ff18144d-8e34-4da3-80c2-7f4c1ea5458b-1
00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:13.970
giving it all kinds of stuff.

e4fa0901-c20f-4da5-971e-c4d322f52a9b-0
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:15.050
Just look at this.

400d5952-27f7-42fe-b33b-d328898ef45a-0
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:18.730
Is body is the outermost layer of who you are.

01e45fe0-01a2-40ea-b8bf-936125bc4826-0
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:21.070
Hello.

7418a014-0204-4016-84e1-88d790c2a98a-0
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:23.670
Is it the outermost layer?

7d5d10b2-ce14-49f5-b43a-a29791d262d9-0
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.990
So two bodies rub each other?

b0ae46de-b3d6-48dc-97b5-bc740dc01233-0
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.830
How does it become intimacy?

5f6ab340-b52e-4e01-81dc-8bfd31c9a460-0
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:34.630
The bark of who you are rubs another bark.

ddb0ad0a-4bd3-4896-b5e6-0b87309b8842-0
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:36.470
If you were a tree.

45841469-d6d5-4760-99ae-9df5201dec65-0
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:39.990
I'm saying, how does it become intimacy?

74e47105-fb37-4965-a4ec-1f2681930646-0
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:44.112
If intimacy has to happen, something more profound has to

74e47105-fb37-4965-a4ec-1f2681930646-1
00:58:44.112 --> 00:58:45.790
touch each other, isn't it?

d3ba0c2c-a297-4920-8bb5-c6263ea0551f-0
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.990
Hello.

114964aa-13c6-4539-9b13-b4c63c696e5c-0
00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:51.380
So I'm talking of intimacy like that.

c7a3f2d9-5cce-45c5-970a-a1d24ae42ceb-0
00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:55.825
Unless there was intimacy, this was not transmitted because

c7a3f2d9-5cce-45c5-970a-a1d24ae42ceb-1
00:58:55.825 --> 00:58:57.620
there are occult dimensions.

d0c9a201-7b70-453d-85d8-1b32ca91feaa-0
00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:00.693
People may misuse it, hurt themselves, hurt somebody else,

d0c9a201-7b70-453d-85d8-1b32ca91feaa-1
00:59:00.693 --> 00:59:02.100
cause damage in the world.

d3c61a5f-f719-4a03-852e-78fdc3d2e46e-0
00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:07.948
If you empower anybody who does not hold everybody as theirs,

d3c61a5f-f719-4a03-852e-78fdc3d2e46e-1
00:59:07.948 --> 00:59:10.980
empowerment is damaged, isn't it?

5a129bbe-4e2c-47ec-96a7-fe8dc4ab5ae4-0
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.260
See, right now, this is what science is doing.

9a101759-82dd-4afa-ac50-953a51e30f2e-0
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.355
Science is not the bad thing, but we empowered people who are

9a101759-82dd-4afa-ac50-953a51e30f2e-1
00:59:18.355 --> 00:59:22.130
not looking at the world in an inclusive manner.

9ff438d2-95a7-437e-9242-1dcd28f3e8a1-0
00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:25.850
You develop science, it becomes a bomb.

39f23469-b33d-45f8-983a-d77693a2495a-0
00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:31.818
Knowledge, unfortunately, is becoming bombs, becoming

39f23469-b33d-45f8-983a-d77693a2495a-1
00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:33.690
terrible destructive forces.

8d60c4ed-9e83-4e57-b64a-e864d4d17856-0
00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:35.210
Why not?

e2cfb5ae-4414-419b-a2b2-557fe1f652aa-0
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:37.130
Because knowledge is destructive.

58565b26-ef8b-4788-8e04-b7021aa219a7-0
00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:39.490
Because the hands that hold it.

39f1e696-100e-4a33-ad08-7f284f2e5b11-0
00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:44.730
So for this reason only in utmost intimacy it was offered.

8f753511-dae2-4f01-9383-2fa349826544-0
00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:52.097
But first 18 years of my life and work went into this to take

8f753511-dae2-4f01-9383-2fa349826544-1
00:59:52.097 --> 00:59:54.520
away the occult part of the work.

229d5620-84ab-4dc5-b3a7-ea5193909a8e-0
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:59.840
Till then even here it happened only in extremely closed groups.

9d8c4564-48b1-4630-b79f-c9e5315c1427-0
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.080
Handful of people never happened outside.

99e5a687-e1cc-43e4-a16c-eba77df9b9e7-0
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.974
But after we managed to separate the occult process from the rest

99e5a687-e1cc-43e4-a16c-eba77df9b9e7-1
01:00:07.974 --> 01:00:12.073
of Shambhavi in the last 1213
years, we are just going out and

99e5a687-e1cc-43e4-a16c-eba77df9b9e7-2
01:00:12.073 --> 01:00:13.959
giving it to the whole world.

38f9c048-70d8-47e6-84f9-476c876faa7e-0
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.645
Just because it's coming easy to you, I'm saying if you had to

38f9c048-70d8-47e6-84f9-476c876faa7e-1
01:00:18.645 --> 01:00:22.276
learn this hundred years ago let's say or 200 years ago

38f9c048-70d8-47e6-84f9-476c876faa7e-2
01:00:22.276 --> 01:00:26.297
normally in India prescription was 12 years, not one weekend,

38f9c048-70d8-47e6-84f9-476c876faa7e-3
01:00:26.297 --> 01:00:27.400
12 years minimum.

09a01288-9ddc-496e-a1c9-b8ce37c0f28b-0
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.031
Because 12 years is 1 solar cycle, you must be here at least

09a01288-9ddc-496e-a1c9-b8ce37c0f28b-1
01:00:31.031 --> 01:00:32.640
for one cycle to receive this.

2d95351f-ca09-4ad7-b287-b9895edf76c2-0
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.720
Otherwise not possible.

d90cf969-91a6-46e2-bb11-579c4a93c5fa-0
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.240
Just because it's coming easy to you, don't miss the possibility.

c3ae8f0e-8969-413f-b400-54b84fe711a2-0
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.960
Because people think good things can can only come the hard way.

b88db549-dc60-474e-bc22-1bcd87d574ef-0
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.990
Sadhguru.

ebb71458-fb8b-4983-8da1-51cdf1672539-0
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.550
Not necessary.

e688ac49-20b0-4a58-a2c1-d8604ad06bd5-0
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:47.350
The greatest things have come to us.

8d18cb12-73f1-4e91-8fb6-9c46a2f76593-0
01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:48.070
Just easy.

eb63b30a-b52c-41a3-bbe1-45d30bde4072-0
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.150
Effortless, isn't it?

b21f0bb2-14dc-4a25-86d7-f934dd0e7788-0
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.430
The air is coming to us effortlessly.

9875dd3f-fd7a-4bbe-bb3a-e92b4b1e5c75-0
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:52.350
Yes or no.

b9a57698-9596-4d8b-ac4d-e792daae5a13-0
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:54.950
Is it the greatest thing that you're doing right now?

c1e04752-3be0-42b0-bb29-3468d85df7a0-0
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:55.470
Breathing.

a4db8603-b1da-4b89-b98e-21cf1240e822-0
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:56.430
Hello.

0f077265-1768-4c2a-9fbf-1732475c8444-0
01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:03.390
If you don't say anything, I'll take it off right now.

6521a82d-5084-4e7d-ad67-5310621de31a-0
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:04.630
You're breathing this air.

06ddb192-c5a6-4006-a531-8c090dfd44e9-0
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.922
Is this the greatest action that you're doing in your life right

06ddb192-c5a6-4006-a531-8c090dfd44e9-1
01:01:07.922 --> 01:01:08.110
now?

866c4745-8d61-4d2b-814b-c78fa27b1a0f-0
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:09.830
Yes, it is.

e0d64c74-2594-4c4d-83f2-b6361bd52510-0
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.550
But it's happening easy.

4b6304e8-3ae1-4afa-a946-28015dd64f89-0
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.645
You think If it becomes difficult, it'll become more

4b6304e8-3ae1-4afa-a946-28015dd64f89-1
01:01:15.645 --> 01:01:16.040
valuable.

00acaac0-91ee-4340-96ab-7636e8103429-0
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.520
It must be easy, isn't it?

356d4377-f008-4c45-b92c-f0d2cab7443e-0
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.920
It must always be easy.

80d44f9e-8a6f-4d05-8cab-56f0aac6d3d3-0
01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.633
If it becomes difficult, we have done something fundamentally

80d44f9e-8a6f-4d05-8cab-56f0aac6d3d3-1
01:01:25.633 --> 01:01:28.480
wrong, either with the atmosphere or with the body.

98fc6844-2593-47f6-a92e-6ed97876ec90-0
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.840
Isn't it so?

55ca730c-50fd-4a9b-83c3-7a2647bd81e7-0
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.222
Joy, love, ecstasy, the most profound dimensions of life,

55ca730c-50fd-4a9b-83c3-7a2647bd81e7-1
01:01:37.222 --> 01:01:42.290
Whatever else for which there are no words, they must come

55ca730c-50fd-4a9b-83c3-7a2647bd81e7-2
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:42.720
easy.

bbc776dd-3e93-42da-bfdb-6a970e1550ae-0
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:47.010
If it comes with hardship, not because it is hard.

701514f5-1211-4227-888b-508f3a3637ec-0
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.450
We are making it hard.

1082b7f4-5326-40a4-9818-642c0f638888-0
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:53.450
If you're senseless, then you must be beaten into it.

da879db2-cb56-4278-ba43-b81000b3b00a-0
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:57.944
If you're a sensible human being, there is no need to make

da879db2-cb56-4278-ba43-b81000b3b00a-1
01:01:57.944 --> 01:01:58.370
it hard.

c2592972-315f-4a01-8276-199f1ce1158f-0
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:05.507
All I'm asking you is next hour of absolute attention and to sit

c2592972-315f-4a01-8276-199f1ce1158f-1
01:02:05.507 --> 01:02:08.490
here like a mother to the world.

9ccdfa09-47dc-4554-bf8e-4ab3796e4cbf-0
01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:08.730
Hmm.

46f14b09-647c-4a41-ae47-192f41b727f2-0
01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.010
This is intimacy, Sadhguru.

22047edd-43df-4c72-bb1d-735dd11228bb-0
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:16.707
My problem is, I assume, intimacy with everybody on the

22047edd-43df-4c72-bb1d-735dd11228bb-1
01:02:16.707 --> 01:02:17.170
planet.

4f366bc7-5baa-4ef7-b9c5-57034bfe7240-0
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:20.050
They may think whatever they want.

f574aaba-81bf-4ddb-8c80-f25bec78a8ab-0
01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:21.010
That's their problem.

05f7719c-6282-4eb9-a0f3-0c04642133e6-0
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:24.090
Because I assume intimacy with everybody.

4cb5c730-6360-40e7-8771-94332cfa76ff-0
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.542
I walk on the street like a lover, always with anything and

4cb5c730-6360-40e7-8771-94332cfa76ff-1
01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:31.330
everything.

e496f246-c5a9-4f73-a736-dc1c36d680cf-0
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:32.410
Hello.

b3db20fd-e215-4ec4-85a5-0893386901ba-0
01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:33.250
You can't stop me.

3f192490-95ed-49b7-9170-5ff97c89df4a-0
01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:34.810
Hello.

0bcfbcd7-8f2f-4136-97e6-edfff389df95-0
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:42.731
You can't stop me because it is not a transaction, is the way

0bcfbcd7-8f2f-4136-97e6-edfff389df95-1
01:02:42.731 --> 01:02:43.470
you are.

4a8f3187-83b5-4172-adc6-25cf55fcef3b-0
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:44.710
Who can stop you?

01bfdd94-dcbc-4d44-a097-047dbd61ed86-0
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:53.150
So if you understand this now, we can wave off the 12 years.

f3698abe-c9c3-4b5a-a790-c6b55e19151f-0
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:59.341
Shall I or shall I keep you for
12 years and say, sweep the

f3698abe-c9c3-4b5a-a790-c6b55e19151f-1
01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:02.030
floor, wash the vessels, do this, do that.

83e02093-fd02-4420-9f88-f8500256e077-0
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:03.110
Then we will see one day.

e104ffa9-d8c2-4014-b187-df7b2d291b56-0
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.230
All this is to wear you down.

3b9e278e-d55c-483a-8460-35cd8fd7accb-0
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:12.279
If you really sit here as mother to the world, No need to do all

3b9e278e-d55c-483a-8460-35cd8fd7accb-1
01:03:12.279 --> 01:03:12.890
that stuff.

4ada954a-06fe-4cb5-9b1b-225b9bdec1cc-0
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:13.130
Hmm.

7af7d0db-0a6e-46f5-8a23-b10e485d308b-0
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.650
You ready?

13d0e69a-0736-488b-a605-9324be9a335a-0
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:28.135
This has been this sambhavi
Innovation day has been a

13d0e69a-0736-488b-a605-9324be9a335a-1
01:03:28.135 --> 01:03:31.942
turning point in millions and millions of lives across the

13d0e69a-0736-488b-a605-9324be9a335a-2
01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:32.330
world.

fff579e2-f77a-40a8-a5c5-14a1d61adc7c-0
01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:34.290
It's my wish and my blessing.

78f42495-0ac1-48a2-b32a-04dac14e8583-0
01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:36.250
It must be so for you also.

17c4d883-ec11-4380-95cf-ebe4b7c715cc-0
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.260
This needs to approach with a little bit of sensitivity.

be14f365-dce5-4be2-a110-15ef85ff2da7-0
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.540
It's in a seed form right now.

a4b60346-ef03-4224-95b8-80f4fe854308-0
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.300
The way we offer it you is in a seed form.

c4681f91-1c93-4e9c-854f-675dac563135-0
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.860
Seed is not an exciting thing.

c816bb13-b5a3-444e-9c95-89217e4b0eb4-0
01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.940
It looks dumb, uninteresting.

17c2e196-f9a6-4fae-8f00-ff2cd58d18c9-0
01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.124
If I show you, suppose you don't know the relationship between a

17c2e196-f9a6-4fae-8f00-ff2cd58d18c9-1
01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:56.820
seed and a tree.

d3a9b45e-ea1a-4984-8a74-50e2b1f8f7ba-0
01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.594
If I show you this big thing and say, see you go and plant this

d3a9b45e-ea1a-4984-8a74-50e2b1f8f7ba-1
01:04:00.594 --> 01:04:03.220
in your back backyard, it will become a huge tree.

d47a078d-9df0-424b-9e60-656db7733903-0
01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:07.210
You see the tree that came like this Only Sadhguru Sir.

1fd2bc07-117c-494d-900b-134846998000-0
01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:07.450
Rubbish.

dd40a115-8f21-4458-8c18-d0f6a1ef39e9-0
01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:08.650
Is you trying to con me?

9935ca9d-52b9-4bb7-8cd8-616afbbf1622-0
01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:11.970
That big tree came from this nonsense.

42f6a579-0285-43b6-a5be-7bdfb7cb55e0-0
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:13.850
You think you can perform a miracle.

20c49ada-59b3-4434-9802-ad50831a9f87-0
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:17.170
But that's how it happened, isn't it?

870d0994-37ce-49d6-9acc-3428108565fc-0
01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:17.450
So.

cb53e9ad-0a47-409e-816a-66a715457965-0
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:18.890
And look at you.

ca49143b-e5b9-40ae-a364-0765c7a372a6-0
01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:23.930
Only two cells they gave you.

99f0abf9-c330-4d17-a0f6-29841c6344b1-0
01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:25.410
They're stingy.

0ee9fe75-529b-401e-affe-784ea407659d-0
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:25.490
Huh?

2169256b-ec8b-4f0c-8d32-92cc7bb6239b-0
01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:29.690
Your father and mother, They gave you only one cell each.

73a8ee9b-86e1-4a4b-b121-9393e2209990-0
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:31.450
They did not give you million cells each.

fe8c1bf3-6bcf-4a3a-a421-1dbbd0bc2413-0
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.090
Only one cell.

78ab38b0-78d4-42ab-adb2-c4e3ca72a76a-0
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:34.370
Look at you, how you become.

8f92b8ac-5752-4406-81de-e86eedd795af-0
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:35.970
Hello.

50ea6f89-6968-4feb-9eca-d8edb695c69d-0
01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:40.849
If you did not know all that little biology, would you

50ea6f89-6968-4feb-9eca-d8edb695c69d-1
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:42.220
believe Would you?

0219a828-14a6-49a2-a6e3-8a84cc0e78d6-0
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:02.230
Nobody has any idea how it's growing except you.

de485722-1e45-45c9-8696-dda703635106-0
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.470
Hmm.

2cc14ca2-5019-4a20-9e10-0090c90a245d-0
01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:07.830
Nobody outside need to know how it is happening.

6b3fae12-dbd3-4348-b040-57a145933f48-0
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:12.681
If you are even blissed out, you can still wear a serious face

6b3fae12-dbd3-4348-b040-57a145933f48-1
01:05:12.681 --> 01:05:17.107
and sit like me, as I do most of the time in the world, even

6b3fae12-dbd3-4348-b040-57a145933f48-2
01:05:17.107 --> 01:05:19.430
though inside I'm bursting away.

7bed96cd-69fb-4380-9664-98edb35d7764-0
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.830
You can do that, right?

7feae4c2-2591-4fbd-8eb2-ec330229cb64-0
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:24.150
Needs little practice.

5bde9a9c-951d-4b78-9b6d-6079167bddbf-0
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:30.333
I'm saying after that, even you, you enter the funeral, but you

5bde9a9c-951d-4b78-9b6d-6079167bddbf-1
01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:31.590
are ecstatic.

66d8ff21-4569-4c1f-aa83-46d31d5ce82d-0
01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:40.430
You can maintain various face postures.

6b92c804-cbdc-4322-a8bb-4f2910a04998-0
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.070
Isn't it so?

586ed6d5-f3c0-4088-89ad-54248e18e859-0
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:44.920
So Sambhavi Mahamudra is like a seed.

c95a4798-7e25-449b-b47a-9cbc1737b468-0
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.000
Once you plant it, you don't mess with it.

1a9e8d21-be6b-49e2-8c44-e1ab8d84a8dd-0
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.240
Once you plant it, you just leave it there.

c7fa5f2a-80b6-45b9-b31c-8337d871cfd7-0
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.320
Daily morning, evening you water it.

2d988d92-a87c-4055-ac91-ad39265ec7b2-0
01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:53.440
That's all.

1b0335b2-107d-4a8a-81d8-4243f3c0db77-0
01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.160
Nothing else to do.

eeb5cd71-a22d-4141-b49c-ed2adcf648c9-0
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.520
Nothing is happening to me.

8944c35a-96a8-4e33-92a9-35050ff40560-0
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.560
You just planted the seed.

c6fc7152-7869-41b5-8aff-e98b2d835fc0-0
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.000
Nothing will happen right now.

01600a4c-5422-439f-b265-df2b455e6d23-0
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.600
Nothing need to happen.

36dc92fa-548d-4537-8851-bc62dfcff44e-0
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.610
You think some firecrackers will burst or lightning and Thunder

36dc92fa-548d-4537-8851-bc62dfcff44e-1
01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:06.280
will happen.

3ae48eca-c7e2-461c-b85e-f305df0347d7-0
01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.600
See, this is always because you've been seeing all these

3ae48eca-c7e2-461c-b85e-f305df0347d7-1
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:09.880
movies.

896a61c1-64d1-4fdf-b419-4e087c0285ca-0
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.970
All of you, sadhguru, whatever part of India you are, TCH.

ec3ff27e-1b4a-4c40-999f-989ed71a165e-0
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.770
Particularly if you are a South
Indian.

5f7bcfb8-fdc4-4ed4-9da9-c2c2b707ed49-0
01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:20.055
In the movies you've been cultivated to believe when

5f7bcfb8-fdc4-4ed4-9da9-c2c2b707ed49-1
01:06:20.055 --> 01:06:24.250
somebody's significantly is being born Thunder and lightning

5f7bcfb8-fdc4-4ed4-9da9-c2c2b707ed49-2
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:25.970
and all this will happen.

8c2338ed-aa69-4396-a33e-b6563e0691a0-0
01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:29.890
Hello to disturb the delivery process.

d7e0c3fd-8a62-4498-9f26-4188a034fe9a-0
01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:33.250
No, no.

b2d9ccdb-2dd8-4606-bca4-fae8914f7122-0
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.290
When I was born it was a nice calm day.

c47fa02c-dd40-4149-861f-785dd04e87c8-0
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:36.090
Normal day.

82f453b0-5387-4dfe-9f99-e03fcdeacab3-0
01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:37.610
OK, no Thunder.

e8b31b66-2dd0-4a5d-98ac-acfc2c7e2f12-0
01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:38.490
Lightning happened.

c584370b-f24a-45fb-95ca-b589d7b4f697-0
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:41.050
So I won't cause any Thunder.

f3d63291-daa5-4e28-99cf-8224e5eae2c3-0
01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:47.221
Lightning for you quietly as the sun rises, quietly transforming

f3d63291-daa5-4e28-99cf-8224e5eae2c3-1
01:06:47.221 --> 01:06:49.690
the whole world, Isn't it?

18b17cde-cf25-4637-8813-771fcba466fa-0
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:50.610
Hello.

3e308142-df0d-4632-ba9e-7cfee94db75f-0
01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:55.130
You think he's coming, at least.

77a6f123-cacc-4036-8eb8-cb66e5de38c5-0
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:56.610
Fortunately, that's one thing.

59125d78-0a29-439c-a5cc-b3eed709b7e2-0
01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:59.450
Even the film makers did not make it like that.

ca20ac43-3c05-4d97-acf5-1f4f695e7237-0
01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:01.730
Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Sun coming up.

4bde2cdd-bd78-462b-ba3c-ac2c392d07c8-0
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:04.490
Even the movies they showed quietly coming up.

a0eb1e7d-85d3-46aa-a0b2-c07929de0ba1-0
01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:05.850
That's one good thing they did.

a064627a-51af-4f44-90c1-b51ac027e661-0
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:11.138
But whenever it's important child is being delivered,

a064627a-51af-4f44-90c1-b51ac027e661-1
01:07:11.138 --> 01:07:13.310
Thunder and lightning happens.

42b84a74-df37-4d53-929d-f5a15b8f2e4f-0
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.550
No such thing need to happen.

3b77a87d-f810-44ba-b2fe-204672f064aa-0
01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:18.710
Nothing dramatic need to happen.

e2e0aafb-a514-46cd-a1ef-f3e0b14a8ca7-0
01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:23.100
It is just that every day, once you've planted a seed, morning,

e2e0aafb-a514-46cd-a1ef-f3e0b14a8ca7-1
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.390
evening, you water it.

d6403105-1ff6-491b-b84d-ec9adcd18436-0
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:27.150
Hmm.

2d8046c9-bd72-4f3c-8f07-5b4c70e627e7-0
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.390
Rest of the time it'll grow.

f7a81063-3b47-4ffa-bef1-07844521d652-0
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:31.230
You don't poison the soil.

22d5031a-2a62-40d0-912b-d8d069b7e221-0
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:33.590
You keep the soil like a mother to the world.

f46f4fb7-67e0-42ff-adb7-1922cbb1e11b-0
01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:35.750
It will grow very rapidly.

0102de31-86e8-4e5c-8c6d-4643e1b4810b-0
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.415
You will be surprised how rapidly and how wonderfully it

0102de31-86e8-4e5c-8c6d-4643e1b4810b-1
01:07:40.415 --> 01:07:41.120
will grow.

147b9e5e-10d6-4ccd-b05f-d27e700d0f23-0
01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:42.960
Are we ready, sadhguru?

ca0ac191-708b-46c7-add9-84e895a8beed-0
01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.853
Right now she will demonstrate
Shambhavi Mahamudra in a

ca0ac191-708b-46c7-add9-84e895a8beed-1
01:07:57.853 --> 01:07:59.080
compressed form.

9f1d6bd5-5961-451d-8064-d7865ea721bf-0
01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:05.268
When I say a compressed form,
Shambhavi Mahamudra happens for

9f1d6bd5-5961-451d-8064-d7865ea721bf-1
01:08:05.268 --> 01:08:06.210
21 minutes.

a0a405b6-4ac6-4194-9b6c-95555dabf745-0
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:09.410
Now she'll do it in two to three minutes.

67e69e2b-e90e-45ca-9b28-6e48c3d8624a-0
01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:11.650
So you don't do this, OK?

77b85cc4-26dd-43d8-9baa-5a0cac549cb1-0
01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:14.130
You just observe what she does.

9f815ec0-8b2a-45f0-8e29-f6931e2889cd-0
01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:17.534
I will take you to the through every step and guide you through

9f815ec0-8b2a-45f0-8e29-f6931e2889cd-1
01:08:17.534 --> 01:08:18.090
the process.

5f19a7b9-923d-4691-8b78-5eda1abb2ef5-0
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.170
Right now you just have to observe.

f50d0205-c654-405a-a9ce-aae19b1d48d3-0
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:23.210
Do not try to imitate any of the things that she's doing.

639719eb-e899-45ab-9f63-c1319957ae44-0
01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:24.010
Please observe.

bbbc4e9e-bd3a-4540-8eba-3405edce172c-0
01:08:29.410 --> 01:10:32.450
Shukh Kriya, I'm chanting ah.

de7ea97d-a10e-4f50-af0f-a837f2ba7eb0-0
01:11:25.370 --> 01:12:13.900
None, Manda.

e577f8b7-68fd-4ecf-98c4-9f0c4607adec-0
01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:21.260
Well, let me tell you what she's doing.

ca0db3ee-6938-487e-bff6-9be1204df600-0
01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.300
You know Sukhakriya.

18e2ccd0-f47e-4c55-8cbe-775f85fdf37d-0
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:29.340
So in the last few days you have understood how to do Sukhakriya.

afdde312-d3f9-45ad-aa05-6fdbaacfcaa0-0
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.300
Inhalation.

5decf489-665a-4c67-9943-5912259496ee-0
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.700
Exhalation through left nostril.

48902112-96a9-4698-b315-c42cf9e3edd0-0
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.460
Right nostril.

903a8d84-8ce9-411a-aa22-15bf0dfed59e-0
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:38.770
Essentially all you have to remember is you always start the

903a8d84-8ce9-411a-aa22-15bf0dfed59e-1
01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:42.140
Kriya with an exhalation through the left nostril.

80b4f74e-84ef-4de7-9569-ffe4813fdd9e-0
01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:47.730
You switch from one nostril to another only after inhalation.

c1a286bc-db1c-4f98-a63a-a23a6e84b17b-0
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:51.970
If you fix these two points it will happen by itself.

b19e7530-cde0-45f0-bfb6-5f2c45cc6ccd-0
01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:56.970
You must just be conscious to keep your body aligned.

8747e0dd-260a-4dc8-91c6-ac575f619c60-0
01:13:56.970 --> 01:13:57.530
Head straight.

77dcb2f3-d0c8-4dd0-b225-a0b589957d01-0
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:59.330
Don't become like this or like this.

5c9f74db-28a7-4a7e-bc46-0b517e82205b-0
01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:03.890
Keep it straight and the three fingers are together.

72de1e0d-a2d5-47a4-b14b-57779bac95af-0
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:07.690
These two little finger on the thumb do the management.

6217644d-c4ea-4b92-9f60-6fe563d26355-0
01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.252
You place it just below the septal bone so that without

6217644d-c4ea-4b92-9f60-6fe563d26355-1
01:14:11.252 --> 01:14:14.170
applying too much pressure you can block the breath.

ecf779c6-05cc-43aa-a512-344171fd3d99-0
01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:19.530
And the breath itself must be as gentle and slow as possible.

6b17e283-2632-4ba1-91a3-18fa04ae0adc-0
01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:23.210
As slowly as possible for you without jerking your breath.

cfd9e285-ecac-4c20-ac6b-b661c2ca9072-0
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:26.650
You do Sukhakriya, you don't have to count.

426a1732-4e09-4af1-8d3d-ac6c816085d7-0
01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:29.850
I will do the counting for you when that is done.

859221c6-faa6-4c5a-b7b0-e8356462ee18-0
01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:35.496
When I say AAM chanting, you do the sound AAM, making sure AA,

859221c6-faa6-4c5a-b7b0-e8356462ee18-1
01:14:35.496 --> 01:14:40.302
Wu and Ma is approximately equal, holding yoga mudra in

859221c6-faa6-4c5a-b7b0-e8356462ee18-2
01:14:40.302 --> 01:14:45.280
your hand, making these three sounds approximately equal.

95b8de89-9cda-4541-9375-e184dc909349-0
01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.400
You do AAM.

3372c1cc-7da8-428e-adec-c96dcf90b8a6-0
01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.280
You do this for 21 times.

bd261dfa-0e54-43ce-9eab-087117889151-0
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.400
Once again, don't bother about counting.

c808cb71-493a-452a-89c8-d2d540789c6c-0
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.986
I will take care of the counting when I say viparita shwasa or I

c808cb71-493a-452a-89c8-d2d540789c6c-1
01:14:55.986 --> 01:14:57.960
say flutter your breath.

62e5bddf-60c8-432b-837f-c1b877da0da9-0
01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.880
What you do is you're sitting like this.

2587c04c-32e9-4d02-937b-7a4c7b450fc3-0
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.743
Sit with a slightly upturned face where naturally your focus

2587c04c-32e9-4d02-937b-7a4c7b450fc3-1
01:15:05.743 --> 01:15:07.880
will be between your eyebrows.

b0c6933e-4cac-47f4-96eb-c31709ef9e63-0
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.750
Just try this and see Sadhguru.

94d936f9-ec10-4bb7-b197-788a749970b5-0
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:12.230
close your eyes and sit with a slightly upturned face.

e047e741-e900-4e38-873d-f7c04cc71e38-0
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:16.150
You will notice there is a mild focus between your eyebrows.

81736161-bcf1-4eb4-9b05-a1b6d356459b-0
01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:34.634
OK, so you turn your face slightly upward so that there is

81736161-bcf1-4eb4-9b05-a1b6d356459b-1
01:15:34.634 --> 01:15:36.050
a mild focus.

c3b92d4d-3dfd-4b6b-8bfb-559535b330e1-0
01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:38.050
You maintain that mild focus.

65899b3b-9426-41c0-8ac7-c2a421ed4784-0
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.410
This is not concentration.

286c87f2-a189-4822-a493-620b5e604a22-0
01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:44.253
This is not hardly moving your eyeballs very hard towards the

286c87f2-a189-4822-a493-620b5e604a22-1
01:15:44.253 --> 01:15:45.650
between the eyebrows.

c62bb813-f72e-4b60-ad03-1683027cfb6b-0
01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:50.758
No, just that mild focus, which will naturally occur when you

c62bb813-f72e-4b60-ad03-1683027cfb6b-1
01:15:50.758 --> 01:15:53.230
put your face slightly upward.

b08232c7-f3f1-401e-a149-c28ea3b6f055-0
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:56.590
Holding it here, now you flutter your breath.

f05d87c4-4309-4594-9cca-237802dd1885-0
01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:01.696
Fluttering your breath means it's both in and out as rapidly

f05d87c4-4309-4594-9cca-237802dd1885-1
01:16:01.696 --> 01:16:02.630
as possible.

1275b160-528c-4ded-ada2-6158e035d1ee-0
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:11.774
Normally you're doing 12 to 15, or maybe some of you could be

1275b160-528c-4ded-ada2-6158e035d1ee-1
01:16:11.774 --> 01:16:16.220
little over that number of breaths per minute.

8d6106e8-0654-43e3-8cc1-4568a79aacab-0
01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:21.100
Now we want you to do 240
breaths per minute.

d6ebf5f7-1ca4-4e21-ace8-978e52f51fdc-0
01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.140
That means per second.

8aa96aa5-c500-4dd4-8002-95ffbcac83b2-0
01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:32.340
How many 4/4 breaths per second?

19224925-7cd4-4966-ab49-8895932d360e-0
01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:35.020
One second means that's one second.

c797957a-10b7-4597-9549-f4656ce14dee-0
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.300
Now in that four breaths should happen.

a8456c10-6862-4e76-95fe-565843c7ce5a-0
01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.220
That means 4 inhalations, 4
exhalation should happen.

998bea81-322e-4a32-98b5-fe37f23c395c-0
01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.380
So it can only happen on the surface.

f5485c4b-53c8-4dcc-8f87-78ece7a99ed3-0
01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.020
It cannot happen deep breathing.

bfd913ec-8db7-4dcf-9be5-065285835c46-0
01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:48.780
Please don't do it.

90597a14-02d0-42ab-a419-f17be7f421fb-0
01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.660
Keep your eyes open.

647db4e4-f2f9-427e-ae9f-6b8d96b87173-0
01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.940
Do not do it it it should not happen as hard breathing.

7edb54ac-e6e0-44e7-b650-427c987574f6-0
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.315
If you sit here like this and do like this, you will end up

7edb54ac-e6e0-44e7-b650-427c987574f6-1
01:16:58.315 --> 01:17:01.900
hyperventilating, which is not at all good for you.

0fc9e7be-65e6-4cb1-85d9-b9d2845745ff-0
01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.540
The way it is done is it's just on the surface.

b170c572-d7ae-47b1-be4e-d7114a33763f-0
01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:08.020
The breath should just tremble like that.

17cf75d7-efad-4c9d-95a6-d7301124a48d-0
01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.020
It just trembles like this.

d1eb9f2f-ac16-4feb-836b-4143bcaa9508-0
01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.020
Just observe this.

2426ea84-817c-4ade-a44c-1f667df9cc5e-0
01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.780
You can barely see it.

043ac84e-ca02-4265-a6ab-8bdd60e6dfb0-0
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:26.990
If you're not able to do this in the beginning, you do like this.

7dfa5930-0366-4b69-b5e4-dfd1d0908b6c-0
01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:34.440
OK?

b7c9fd69-b029-439f-a6aa-cebc24bfa68b-0
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.280
You make sure it is there after some time.

f9704696-fa44-4d76-9619-5d64af530dc5-0
01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.480
As time goes by, it'll become more and more subtle.

cc3f9485-a5c9-4c65-ac32-e74eab4a519f-0
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.880
That's how it should be.

7ea50b36-394e-4d45-bc5b-c97628f524b8-0
01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.960
But right now you breathe like this, but as rapidly as you can.

ddad5161-f475-4499-9297-ffba5495a67f-0
01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.720
240 breaths per minute.

f604a7b6-dd6e-432b-ad70-109325e9fcd5-0
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.360
That is where we should go.

3a89e5bb-8bb8-4fc5-8150-bb68befbe234-0
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:57.600
So you don't breathe hard or don't only start exhalation.

8232f220-f4a0-485a-84cf-c5439a89834d-0
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.520
There are tendencies to do this.

5a1d73b5-7380-4fa3-9f94-200a01708ddc-0
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.848
If you find that as you're doing it, after some time you feel

5a1d73b5-7380-4fa3-9f94-200a01708ddc-1
01:18:02.848 --> 01:18:05.953
like gasping for breath, that is because you're only pushing it

5a1d73b5-7380-4fa3-9f94-200a01708ddc-2
01:18:05.953 --> 01:18:07.360
out, You're not taking it in.

d22239e4-f59e-445c-a036-8a6562bdbd75-0
01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:15.123
If both are happening, you will not feel that focus is between

d22239e4-f59e-445c-a036-8a6562bdbd75-1
01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:20.520
the eyebrows and the breath is going like this.

9b5cdacc-d541-47ca-9b06-def200c7d84a-0
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.320
You do this for three to four minutes Sadhguru.

4b7280c0-aa8b-4012-86dd-61d6ad98aad0-0
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.161
When I say bhanda, you take a deep inhalation, take your head

4b7280c0-aa8b-4012-86dd-61d6ad98aad0-1
01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:30.640
back, tuck your chin in, bring it down.

2aea689c-1d07-4771-993a-09ad41bfc82b-0
01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.112
There are three moments to this, but this must happen like 1

2aea689c-1d07-4771-993a-09ad41bfc82b-1
01:18:34.112 --> 01:18:37.472
fluid motion, taking your head back, tucking your chin in,

2aea689c-1d07-4771-993a-09ad41bfc82b-2
01:18:37.472 --> 01:18:38.440
bringing it down.

0347dd23-a185-4a0b-98b3-425e107fa39b-0
01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.852
We must understand we are taking the head back only to facilitate

0347dd23-a185-4a0b-98b3-425e107fa39b-1
01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:44.560
the tucking in of the chin.

36fcce28-382b-40cf-b95e-6dac3e4ffb2d-0
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.617
You should not take too much time out there you because if

36fcce28-382b-40cf-b95e-6dac3e4ffb2d-1
01:18:48.617 --> 01:18:52.822
you take more time in this, your ability to hold the Kumbakka or

36fcce28-382b-40cf-b95e-6dac3e4ffb2d-2
01:18:52.822 --> 01:18:56.510
the fullness of the breath will come down significantly.

345550cc-8206-4013-a5eb-99856183a3fd-0
01:18:56.830 --> 01:19:00.619
So you take it back, tuck it in, bring it down pit of the I mean

345550cc-8206-4013-a5eb-99856183a3fd-1
01:19:00.619 --> 01:19:03.941
the chin of the chin should go and sit in the pit of the

345550cc-8206-4013-a5eb-99856183a3fd-2
01:19:03.941 --> 01:19:04.350
throat.

06286d08-c0fb-4d7a-9ed1-9ed46726b000-0
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:05.550
This is the neck lock.

915d21d9-c561-4aed-b2b7-7335f19f89a4-0
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:09.262
Once you engage the neck lock, you consciously pull the

915d21d9-c561-4aed-b2b7-7335f19f89a4-1
01:19:09.262 --> 01:19:12.614
diaphragm muscles N then constrict the anal muscles and

915d21d9-c561-4aed-b2b7-7335f19f89a4-2
01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.710
pull them up and hold it that way.

5765e569-1c24-4083-b467-cc8b6ae9c329-0
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:18.750
Holding these three bandas or both these three locks.

2b15bc6e-e4bc-469e-b7b5-bd26a5600335-0
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.205
Sadhguru, the neck lock, the diaphragm lock and the anal lock

2b15bc6e-e4bc-469e-b7b5-bd26a5600335-1
01:19:22.205 --> 01:19:23.320
in place with the mush.

c047dea5-6db9-46c9-9dd8-b9d94c575b1f-0
01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.080
You should not do it.

fd0bcea5-b5d8-4181-966b-f577fdc5d5ed-0
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080
Please be here.

16c68a46-ed04-4b77-a7b3-40452db5c817-0
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.360
Please don't do the locks yet.

0d5f6906-4b1e-43ec-a987-1ba3a45d50d8-0
01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.360
Holding these three locks, you have fullness of breath.

c73067d4-c436-45e2-97ba-530cc639b7e1-0
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.480
Stay there.

22f6c746-14a3-4a46-a8a8-1171bf302fc2-0
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.320
Stay there as long as it's comfortable for you.

87e50233-a26f-42c6-a5fe-2c70c6b7b198-0
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.560
That means you do not forcefully hold it like this.

60467108-4698-4dba-b95f-116add2a7f87-0
01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.520
You stay there as long as it's comfortable.

935e9a85-4965-4d10-9d5b-a9acf26eed0a-0
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.840
When you feel like exhalation, you exhale.

a7ff9829-c67f-44b9-a484-06c0b82d8ada-0
01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:48.620
Sadhguru.

aee0b2cb-6269-4897-9e6b-48464b0b9f5f-0
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:53.634
When you exhale, you must be able to exhale slowly, letting

aee0b2cb-6269-4897-9e6b-48464b0b9f5f-1
01:19:53.634 --> 01:19:54.220
it out.

fbe7c3f1-8670-4446-8f50-cf8b9d7dea80-0
01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:59.700
If it goes out, then that means you have held it too long.

5db4bb1d-cae5-433f-8eb5-3a111f2e2ed8-0
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.100
So do not take it to that point where it'll burst out.

9f1a81fc-e452-4573-bd25-dc1f0c0abbb5-0
01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.546
You hold it to that point where you can still control your

9f1a81fc-e452-4573-bd25-dc1f0c0abbb5-1
01:20:06.546 --> 01:20:07.940
breath in a controlled way.

e1837c96-a640-4c5b-b81a-12c942a35f25-0
01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.500
You can let it out through the nostrils.

cad7cc0b-c936-49cc-97d9-259be3d45349-0
01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.300
So after you do that, now the lungs are empty.

49c36991-8d45-4f0a-80ef-e06771b0e27b-0
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.220
Now when it is empty, once again engage the.

5f2a1b70-8fa6-4fcc-9dc8-d9ea9e1e0f04-0
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:21.982
Neck lock Diaphragm lock Analog
First time you engage this lock

5f2a1b70-8fa6-4fcc-9dc8-d9ea9e1e0f04-1
01:20:21.982 --> 01:20:23.750
on the fullness of breath.

9b4bae4f-7245-4a15-9ce9-264ed478267d-0
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:27.950
This time you're engaging the lock on the emptiness of breath.

ec304a62-2ce0-4255-8807-e10ee748b8b1-0
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:32.590
So there are only two times that you're doing these bandhas.

ae2a4d0c-99cf-4aab-85ad-f3410a4c2bca-0
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:36.797
Once with the fullness of breath, next time with the

ae2a4d0c-99cf-4aab-85ad-f3410a4c2bca-1
01:20:36.797 --> 01:20:38.310
emptiness of breath.

84b3c6e1-8d8d-42bd-b828-92577e5897e8-0
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:42.285
After that, once you bring your head up through this whole time,

84b3c6e1-8d8d-42bd-b828-92577e5897e8-1
01:20:42.285 --> 01:20:44.470
keep the focus between your eyebrows.

c97a95c4-e74d-4540-9b91-a040ccca7573-0
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:48.250
When you bring it up, sit with a slightly upturned face.

e1f59377-25f4-4a71-b5ab-d101adc77b7d-0
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:52.591
Focus is here, but be conscious about the natural movement of

e1f59377-25f4-4a71-b5ab-d101adc77b7d-1
01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:53.050
breath.

1e4cb5e2-adcd-46fe-a2da-6d5230378050-0
01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:56.730
That means you do not try to breathe in any particular way.

4f2355ea-0e13-427f-ab63-d316b660e4b8-0
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:00.644
Whichever way the breath is happening, you're conscious of

4f2355ea-0e13-427f-ab63-d316b660e4b8-1
01:21:00.644 --> 01:21:02.610
it, but your mental focus is here.

b46b0f3b-1ecf-476c-a1de-69975b979b73-0
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:04.770
But you're conscious of the moment of breath.

814317e7-0a6c-4f1e-ab87-00c1e1e180dd-0
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:06.050
You just sit there.

97ca0373-0480-40bd-818d-111a206f735d-0
01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:10.548
There may be some noise, there may be some, maybe some chant or

97ca0373-0480-40bd-818d-111a206f735d-1
01:21:10.548 --> 01:21:11.690
drum or whatever.

01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:15.070
Whatever happens outside, don't bother about it.

b6a80a9f-adfc-4ee2-a291-2e28fecd6aaa-0
01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:18.705
You're not responding to the external world, Whatever

b6a80a9f-adfc-4ee2-a291-2e28fecd6aaa-1
01:21:18.705 --> 01:21:22.676
happens, not responding to the inner world also in a certain

b6a80a9f-adfc-4ee2-a291-2e28fecd6aaa-2
01:21:22.676 --> 01:21:24.629
way, because it may so happen.

5538d919-711a-46d2-8788-27673bf85d9e-0
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.878
Your body shook a little bit, a teardrop came, something else

5538d919-711a-46d2-8788-27673bf85d9e-1
01:21:27.878 --> 01:21:28.350
happened.

a40b4e7e-d1a3-4edd-af51-497e259bfb61-0
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.110
Is it OK in case one drop of tear fell out?

c2fe8055-798d-46a0-a901-73688e25f838-0
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:33.910
Hello is all right.

fa47fbef-5af1-46e8-a04f-115936b8ab11-0
01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:37.150
So if it comes you want to investigate everybody?

fc74e554-5f5a-4d58-a045-b6098c6a6db5-0
01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:39.270
Is everybody having teardrops or just me?

15c6e439-b980-4405-9e49-209c04107499-0
01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.140
You leave that.

1072d792-4149-4229-84a8-09fd34b4e2f8-0
01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:45.220
I'm saying whatever comes from within, it's all right.

2199e33c-a332-4705-8ea3-5f118a13e6d3-0
01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:45.980
Just leave it.

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:49.380
If it happened that your body shook like that, it's OK.

bf3e85b2-ccc8-484d-9574-3a71a0ebc1af-0
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.300
You just stay with the process.

46f01740-5989-4c81-9573-faa85a3271e5-0
01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.140
You don't run away with the body.

adc19c79-b3dd-4aae-86f1-5b6c3d0979b7-0
01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.380
Tears came.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.100
It's OK.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.660
Ah, scream escaped.

8ab5a858-a5b0-4fc6-aed2-e625178ea891-0
01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.300
It's not that you have to scream.

26cb4823-ded3-4172-aa37-ea70dd984609-0
01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.180
Let's say unconsciously, a scream escaped.

2a20b161-3339-4063-ab69-5067fea19cdf-0
01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:10.580
It's OK or you are perfectly fine doing everything like this.

86d405ee-a598-4de1-a910-199aeb660297-0
01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:15.420
Somebody next to you is shaking and maybe screaming it is OK.

02a44196-cdcd-4c68-94b9-70989f7278ec-0
01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.460
It's not your business.

fea293b6-0a5b-4a1d-a4b7-8b1a51798732-0
01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.740
They are my business, OK?

7c30fdd0-6d6f-46a8-9ffe-0dc95763bd65-0
01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:21.340
Your business is to put this through properly.

3d89fa61-5848-4b02-a329-cc6e080be5a7-0
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:24.659

f4563ec2-f37e-4c1d-befa-e55d7fe4efd3-0

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.960
You will just stick to the process for 21 minutes.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.360
Is that clear?

Once you sit there you should not have any other issues.
