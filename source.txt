00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.040
So now we'll be learning the first step of Shambhavi.

3e5b6e84-0927-4684-8d20-78e55ecd5f0c-0
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.560
Mahamudra, sadly, will guide us through this.

c4c919bb-2251-4433-a4aa-eb13c0000d71-0
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.280
Please sit in other Sudesana with your palms facing upwards.

227cb22d-f464-4549-8490-0951e1cddb67-0
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.000
Keep your eyes open.

a81fbca7-b79f-4510-92b3-d9ca302f8fdd-0
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.192
Check the dominance of breath in your nose, so see if it's

a81fbca7-b79f-4510-92b3-d9ca302f8fdd-1
00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:36.310
switched your flip problem.

fde4bd07-5860-4aff-8e2a-d08bfe862052-0
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.550
Hmm.

cbd6f04b-218b-4fc3-bf18-3a69998daeb4-0
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.610
This shift in the dominance of breath is only a manifestation

cbd6f04b-218b-4fc3-bf18-3a69998daeb4-1
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.670
of the shift that's happening on the level of your energy body.

815653d9-1177-4bc6-9582-26c83922d621-0
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.162
If the energy shifts from right to left in the next maximum of

815653d9-1177-4bc6-9582-26c83922d621-1
00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.910
eight minutes, the breath will shift.

6772b81f-4057-40d8-8293-9202bfdcd433-0
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.670
The breath takes anywhere over 6
minutes.

5c08e6e8-65cc-49f7-a97e-0883f57adb2e-0
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.150
That's not good.

a1d62171-a626-487e-a684-20a93f344198-0
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.750
If it's within 3 minutes, it's very good.

98c47eae-0456-4af9-b293-9dcee24cac81-0
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.547
If it's less than one minute, that means you're fantastic

98c47eae-0456-4af9-b293-9dcee24cac81-1
00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:22.759
physically, mentally, every way life is doing great, then only

98c47eae-0456-4af9-b293-9dcee24cac81-2
00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.230
it will shift quickly.

16d83607-6f67-413c-a6ed-c4498ce00dad-0
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.490
Otherwise you will see in children it Will Young infants

16d83607-6f67-413c-a6ed-c4498ce00dad-1
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.750
and young children.

f891a8f0-1c23-4058-81d6-6a529bb4838b-0
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030
It will shift almost instantly.

abf7d045-803a-4893-b008-6f089b0ac1b1-0
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.600
It could happen with the necessary sadhana.

1092d023-896c-4c7d-9a32-8e4b3ca70b0e-0
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.040
It will be so for many adults.

9750ff07-0275-4915-979b-a1cb656c717d-0
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.560
Also in these Nadis, pingala Ida are the right and the left.

31dba11f-5b97-44aa-8acf-d2553c195b58-0
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.200
There is a central nadi known as Shimna.

ea31bfdb-b85a-4f7c-a916-ab5f1862671b-0
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.292
Generally there's no mention of this in most places because for

ea31bfdb-b85a-4f7c-a916-ab5f1862671b-1
00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:55.400
most human beings this is dormant.

0ed336b8-f16a-4041-9461-46fe59b5cb88-0
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.240
It never becomes active.

7ff0515a-5f01-448b-a098-c8da93d4225c-0
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.258
This is the most important aspect of human Physiology

7ff0515a-5f01-448b-a098-c8da93d4225c-1
00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:06.812
Sadhguru, but it remains dormant in over 90% of the people,

7ff0515a-5f01-448b-a098-c8da93d4225c-2
00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:11.290
except maybe at a certain stage of life, maybe in infancy.

3c76705f-d11a-4ba1-a67e-1526de08be05-0
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.283
And when they are very close to death it may happen a little

3c76705f-d11a-4ba1-a67e-1526de08be05-1
00:02:15.283 --> 00:02:16.970
bit, but through their life.

0ca48a8a-98e3-4ec5-8356-7cc1c31160fa-0
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.650
Maybe 90 is a very cruel percentage.

dbf80046-2826-400c-9402-ad9daaaa5901-0
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.570
Let's say 75% of the people remain dormant in their

dbf80046-2826-400c-9402-ad9daaaa5901-1
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.530
Sushamna, but it is the most important one.

824da7bb-2717-48ef-8f66-c5d0d223e753-0
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.447
If your energy is entered into Shushumna, you enter a new kind

824da7bb-2717-48ef-8f66-c5d0d223e753-1
00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:34.060
of balance.

77204844-2b57-40fc-b265-1d28264eb4fc-0
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.108
When I say balance, all of you are reasonably balanced right

77204844-2b57-40fc-b265-1d28264eb4fc-1
00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:38.300
now.

4e547fe3-b2c0-4c93-9a5d-a1dfe6e5d395-0
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.576
But if the outside situation goes haywire, you also join the

4e547fe3-b2c0-4c93-9a5d-a1dfe6e5d395-1
00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:43.500
gang, isn't it?

dad91432-4064-42b0-9de0-3bcad129bc41-0
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.633
Yes, if the situations around you lose balance, you also lose

dad91432-4064-42b0-9de0-3bcad129bc41-1
00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:51.060
tend to lose balance.

aaf638ff-20f4-490d-8c59-89bad315370b-0
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.121
If your energy is entered into Shushumna, you have a balance

aaf638ff-20f4-490d-8c59-89bad315370b-1
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:58.380
which cannot be disturbed by the outside situation.

9931fd93-4cc3-4c57-a3bf-87da12fc3c64-0
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.301
This is very important for one who is wanting to scale the

9931fd93-4cc3-4c57-a3bf-87da12fc3c64-1
00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:05.160
peaks of his consciousness.

04434a85-7328-4ba4-b9ed-aba2aed45f97-0
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.385
Because suppose we want to fix that bulb and we get you a

04434a85-7328-4ba4-b9ed-aba2aed45f97-1
00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:13.200
ladder.

d6486911-e4a4-424a-b8d0-d48c768720f1-0
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.080
Somebody is holding this ladder for you.

0fb9b381-c2a0-4dfe-8780-37d9a0df2f40-0
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.360
They are like this.

f129ff82-e884-44bb-b302-64ec6af0172c-0
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.520
How many runs will you go up?

6bf19ca4-d066-453b-9673-4ba5e69aceb9-0
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.760
Hmm.

1024fe88-4be1-42f8-a009-3918509b70f2-0
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.440
Somebody unsteady is holding the balance.

c95ebd68-9708-43af-a51e-b38ac5cf5b0d-0
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.040
How high will you go up?

8978fbd0-ae72-4c0e-b039-310ca89643fb-0
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.636
Only as high as it's safe for you to jump in case you have to

8978fbd0-ae72-4c0e-b039-310ca89643fb-1
00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:31.950
jump.

39bdcbe7-70a5-4f93-bd65-83c1f4c9d625-0
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.390
Not beyond that, isn't it?

b366051a-1528-4d99-b778-cec5db69b7c9-0
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.270
That's exactly what's happening with life.

71eb892d-6814-4de3-ad24-15235157dc3e-0
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.470
You only go as far as you think it's safe.

a337ee51-f8a8-493b-a1ae-3777d2d890a2-0
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.790
Nowhere beyond that.

bfc44ec7-1793-4dbd-a3a6-e2a79da1cd99-0
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.553
But if somebody was holding this ladder rock steady, now you

bfc44ec7-1793-4dbd-a3a6-e2a79da1cd99-1
00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.360
would go all the way up, isn't it, Sadhguru?

8e66a270-fa3d-4568-aa27-c5bc683a5ad4-0
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.050
Having that little space within you which is not disturbed by

8e66a270-fa3d-4568-aa27-c5bc683a5ad4-1
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.287
anything around you is very important if one is serious

8e66a270-fa3d-4568-aa27-c5bc683a5ad4-2
00:03:59.287 --> 00:04:03.600
about scaling or exploring different dimensions of life.

1752e388-c30e-48c9-b54b-2883b9984554-0
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.010
Otherwise, when there is imbalance, fear is a natural

1752e388-c30e-48c9-b54b-2883b9984554-1
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.920
consequence.

bff4cdca-b6fe-4e85-bcba-fd702b95e25d-0
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.960
Where there is imbalance, fear is a natural consequence.

96e34337-b9e4-4e85-96e7-751c55cee659-0
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.347
Do you remember the first time when you started walking as a

96e34337-b9e4-4e85-96e7-751c55cee659-1
00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:17.070
little child?

9508892c-7b45-46ba-9969-cc60cb62a7c3-0
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.230
Imbalance is fear cycle.

5617f139-599c-457b-b995-dab0df46c3f4-0
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.350
Imbalance is fear.

cbf2d6ef-b460-4a00-b1e3-bcf14e3179a2-0
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.670
Wherever imbalance is fear isn't it?

44eda3e9-92ad-412a-9f6d-997a095ff8a1-0
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.670
Where there is imbalance, fear will naturally manifest itself.

fac748b0-d2ba-4def-9413-0ea41c9137ff-0
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.181
So bringing that balance which is not in any way subject to

fac748b0-d2ba-4def-9413-0ea41c9137ff-1
00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:34.310
external realities is important.

a571f605-40a5-427a-a00d-3549079e9fd3-0
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.022
So before we push energies into Shushumna, the Shambhaviya

a571f605-40a5-427a-a00d-3549079e9fd3-1
00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:41.350
Mahamatra is aimed towards pushing energies into Shushumna.

708b0d86-2b09-4a2e-b9f2-d81c7469ea22-0
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.250
Sadhguru.

30773b88-7197-4327-a5c4-b8f108868c1c-0
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.261
Before we do that, it's very important that we bring a

30773b88-7197-4327-a5c4-b8f108868c1c-1
00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:48.656
balance between the pingala and the eeda or the right and the

30773b88-7197-4327-a5c4-b8f108868c1c-2
00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:48.930
left.

e3893597-99be-4607-afbe-abb42fa0bbe0-0
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.399
To bring this balance, we will do a certain kriya called

e3893597-99be-4607-afbe-abb42fa0bbe0-1
00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.850
sukkha.

7b73c299-526d-488e-a34e-0f32ea96b32f-0
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.610
Kriya TCH.

6c1277c9-c812-4a4f-b586-32b169f03f06-0
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.930
The word sukha means comfort.

89ecd612-3198-4f0d-b882-b2f5de6eba3e-0
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.170
Hmm.

2c0d72e3-832f-449a-9423-436bd751b56f-0
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.650
Kriya means an inner act.

864c72fe-da91-45b9-825c-8a3a2213abf6-0
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.170
You will like this.

a890b837-5fcc-41af-89ef-10e9a6e52909-0
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.970
It's comfort.

5c40822c-2f5a-438c-818a-6b03f92157de-0
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.130
You know.

f96aee5d-e359-4271-a4b4-1a46174ba7b6-0
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.330
Sadhguru, how to do sukha kriya?

0be0de3d-dd01-4831-868b-55b377cb21f3-0
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.210
She will demonstrate.

d2fa6b6e-2076-45c1-82f9-d355252057b1-0
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:52.049
Please observe now what's being done is your left hand is in

d2fa6b6e-2076-45c1-82f9-d355252057b1-1
00:05:52.049 --> 00:06:32.080
your lap, loosely placed, facing upward, loosely placed.

d03f1fbd-dd77-49d1-9588-b5c7139461b7-0
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.200
The whole arm should be loose and relaxed.

c43722bd-6976-4d9f-8ed6-dd1b0f5be028-0
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.320
Don't do it dead, just listen loosely placed.

ee31d632-ce8e-458d-8c68-3b252426d71c-0
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.560
Your right hand.

46184a48-dff1-49fe-89e9-27e72152fad0-0
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.440
These three fingers should be together.

655c2492-da94-4c43-b184-be8668a9c354-0
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.440
The thumb and the little finger should be loose to move.

648d8758-2569-4bf9-bd7c-1a04dce3bef2-0
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.413
You must make sure when you hold it, these three fingers are

648d8758-2569-4bf9-bd7c-1a04dce3bef2-1
00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:52.598
pointing straight up, but not falling upon your face, away

648d8758-2569-4bf9-bd7c-1a04dce3bef2-2
00:06:52.598 --> 00:06:55.460
from your face, but pointing straight out the thumb.

5b5b3a19-d7da-4c8c-9c64-ed7fa4796df3-0
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.860
This point of the thumb.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.340
The inside of the thumb should locate that space.

30f4bfdd-484e-4147-8ef2-d16baabe51d6-0
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.064
There is a septal bone here just beneath the septal bone, a

30f4bfdd-484e-4147-8ef2-d16baabe51d6-1
00:07:04.064 --> 00:07:06.820
millimeter or two millimeters beneath the bone.

a41dd53e-9a28-44af-b78d-fa4e9ef431dc-0
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.409
If you just place your hand like this with with mild contact, you

a41dd53e-9a28-44af-b78d-fa4e9ef431dc-1
00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:13.780
will effectively block the nostrils.

44602181-d97c-4e25-899e-d5eddec9f0dc-0
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.048
If you try to block it here, you will have to apply a lot of

44602181-d97c-4e25-899e-d5eddec9f0dc-1
00:07:17.048 --> 00:07:17.460
pressure.

f4d68e1b-9b0c-4b24-a1a0-094985f7bf3f-0
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.420
Please, please, please.

3ed3bbe8-d1b0-4351-b7ce-4a30c05be114-0
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.210
I know you like it, but please be with me.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.534
If you try to put it block it here, you will have to apply a

3a87c536-4a75-44fe-9af2-344d5255ff31-1
00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:28.930
lot of pressure, which is not the way it works.

64e11540-84a5-48e7-9873-8449cf6d3468-0
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.841
So find the septal bone, just a millimeter or two beneath the

64e11540-84a5-48e7-9873-8449cf6d3468-1
00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:34.730
septal bone.

d8faa595-7619-4cda-914f-358e6635d96a-0
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.050
If you just touch it, it'll get effectively blocked.

5ac9e2d7-02f0-4dbf-8aa5-b02a8644ba67-0
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.968
These three fingers are pointing straight up, eyes closed, left

5ac9e2d7-02f0-4dbf-8aa5-b02a8644ba67-1
00:07:40.968 --> 00:07:43.210
hand in your lap, not upon your thigh.

2b3db257-dacc-464a-823a-103aab368470-0
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.010
It is in your lap.

448d79e2-809a-4e05-85c2-f3dc6b9c143e-0
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.850
Holding it this way, you exhale through the left nostril.

b32ea1ca-8e32-481b-8f14-aef13c3e0a8e-0
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.620
After the exhalation is complete, you inhale through the

b32ea1ca-8e32-481b-8f14-aef13c3e0a8e-1
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.430
same nostril.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.834
After the inhalation is complete, you use the little

c1cb3736-3c29-422c-947b-7816b442cac2-1
00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:03.330
finger in the same fashion as you use the thumb and block the

c1cb3736-3c29-422c-947b-7816b442cac2-2
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.030
left nostril and exhale through the right nostril.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.870
Inhale through the same nostril.

21ec3a2f-e1c7-4bd1-ae92-574a90de4d52-0
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.590
Exhale through the left nostril.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.550
Now, once you close your eyes.

47cc563b-1b81-4fb1-88f6-35fbfa12296c-0
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.470
Right nostril, left nostril.

ef1be45f-9b9a-4238-a249-1e9a5c026060-0
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.710
Left nostril, right nostril.

b85a5ebd-2956-4382-9639-10d41147b861-0
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.643
After some time you don't know which is which, so all you have

b85a5ebd-2956-4382-9639-10d41147b861-1
00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:22.210
to remember is this.

abcc61ce-acd1-42d6-9d63-e876af9c17f8-0
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.953
You always begin and close the kriya with an exhalation through

abcc61ce-acd1-42d6-9d63-e876af9c17f8-1
00:08:27.953 --> 00:08:29.330
the left nostril.

You start the kriya with an exhalation through the left

00:08:32.874 --> 00:08:34.490
nostril when you want to close it.

03ce5762-e367-447c-84dc-5167b522a4d4-0
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.730
When I say stop, you don't stop immediately.

68722838-1b0b-4c7f-b5d3-df02d7791acc-0
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.890
You exhale through the left nostril and then you stop.

ed9b417c-a807-4671-8dd1-589c08ba2b0d-0
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.770
After every exhalation, you inhale through the same nostril.

83501425-eeb3-4120-9c8c-e7060862ce57-0
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.054
After every inhalation, you switch and exhale through the

83501425-eeb3-4120-9c8c-e7060862ce57-1
00:08:50.054 --> 00:08:50.910
other nostril.

d00cda2c-1ffa-4460-b7b8-000fa7aed781-0
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.950
This means your normal breath is like this.

1259428b-db4e-4352-82ea-ab7d39542a4c-0
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.070
Inhalation, Exhalation.

0a5d7ecc-7902-490c-9b2b-d6ec8db9cc19-0
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.731
Now what you're doing is inhalation, exhalation,

0a5d7ecc-7902-490c-9b2b-d6ec8db9cc19-1
00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:02.750
inhalation, exhalation.

ecca7574-262a-44f7-a6e3-5002745bafe4-0
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.590
You're breathing in the form of a inverted U like this.

418d67bd-85d3-40bd-adff-1ccdddfaa54d-0
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.630
OK, you're breathing this way.

b443de2d-f8d3-4288-8359-68f5d052398e-0
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.700
So for this you have to just remember 2 points sadhguru.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.174
You always exhale through the left nostril and begin the

e4358026-9473-4b92-a6b4-61557bf0449c-1
00:09:16.174 --> 00:09:16.540
kriya.

a5d8bda0-2114-460b-9b72-81c9ce7d86c7-0
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.387
When you want to close it, you exhale through the left left

a5d8bda0-2114-460b-9b72-81c9ce7d86c7-1
00:09:20.387 --> 00:09:21.940
nostril and close the kriya.

8cc952c3-5d86-4172-adcd-158fbe3dffaa-0
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.038
You switch switch from 1 nostril to another nostril only after

8cc952c3-5d86-4172-adcd-158fbe3dffaa-1
00:09:27.038 --> 00:09:29.660
inhalation, not after exhalation.

529f2b34-7ee3-4fb5-8749-f2386082adba-0
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.540
Is this clear to you?

7b86e777-0cbc-468f-82bf-6900baf47920-0
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.620
Is this clear to you Sadhguru?

9e4466a3-70c7-4fed-bd08-11523a6e67ce-0
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.540
Are there people who have blocked nostrils?

56daca4c-cde7-47c5-991e-c632180c8286-0
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.195
It is very important that before you start the clear, your

56daca4c-cde7-47c5-991e-c632180c8286-1
00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:45.160
nostrils are clear.

eb7da354-7997-403b-a547-33976fb3dc84-0

So how to clear the nostrils?

f7080fe0-5bd2-4407-9f31-c6ecd1d316a6-0

We'll see the demonstration.

Make a fist in both the hands.

63cd88e4-c16e-43cf-8cbf-fe7455171bf4-0
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.978
Lift the hands up and swing them down vigorously by making a

00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:33.580
sound from the throat like this.

9d12eb5d-5254-4364-bee6-916b83308be0-0
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.260
Do this 25 to 30 times.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.950
So are there people who have blocked nostrils?

46f9f908-5451-4589-a9bc-22e04dd7d506-0

aafbcf7b-e23b-4192-a2af-7f9de995d57a-0

The important things to remember is you inhale and exhale slowly.

d1810abd-a9b9-449e-80d0-1982e669e663-0
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.060
No jerks.

64ce27a7-0c7d-4eef-9dda-3b0399c80905-0
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:07.142
Jerks means if you try to do it very forcefully, this will

64ce27a7-0c7d-4eef-9dda-3b0399c80905-1
00:13:07.142 --> 00:13:07.940
happen.

63562737-2ef9-47b2-9343-d4c97f0117aa-0
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.598
If you try to do forcefully, that will that those aberrations

63562737-2ef9-47b2-9343-d4c97f0117aa-1
00:13:11.598 --> 00:13:12.660
should not happen.

e38537f1-307e-412b-8cfd-39f7d96b1b03-0
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.020
A slow and clean inhalation.

dbfcbba1-6a2f-467e-b5b8-9ce2773f16cd-0
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.340
A slow and clean exhalation.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.100
This how how much can you stretch?

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.740
It depends upon individual lung capacity.

720ccbed-a68a-4c05-af00-663310505d9c-0
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.785

It's OK, you do it only as per your capability.

6558bdf5-1692-4ecb-a5d6-05ccf5215bce-0
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.620

a51cba3c-b6a5-4aed-870d-dff9529bf65a-0
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.220

You make sure your breath is clean and smooth, no anything

00:14:01.077 --> 00:14:05.654
like that, and you always start the kriya with an exhalation

c1ad08d4-3e39-498e-b3d1-9c114b55f90f-2
00:14:05.654 --> 00:14:07.530

00:14:20.157 --> 00:14:21.190

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.503
If you don't do this, you will take a long time to balance

ec3d58ee-c440-4c1c-91b9-82286a3f66bd-1
00:14:36.503 --> 00:14:36.750

00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:41.390

7d1a1991-bba8-4fe2-8575-04565c8ef1ca-0

Ardhasiddhasana means your heel should be touching your perineum

43234dde-8048-4c46-9bf7-730093473c96-1
00:15:22.107 --> 00:15:25.835

00:23:34.697 --> 00:23:38.780
different from Suka Kriya including the breathing.

7d0706d9-6fce-47de-bb93-80a6397f6a9f-0
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.248

So if there is such a problem, one simple solution will be warm

6d29f613-ea56-4816-9b90-dac530ad6038-1
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.580
ghee or clarified butter.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.810
Another simple solution is the saline water spray.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.010
So now we'll be doing this together.

7c0b1c02-c70b-435c-bb11-edb03ce03058-0
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.210
Please sit and address to Desana.

9a4f9090-ec24-4f86-99a4-1a5cda9661d6-0
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.410
Those of you wearing spectacles, please keep them aside.

4f0e58f6-5d9e-473a-89c0-f20db7140f13-0
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.490
We'll be uttering arm together with Sadhguru.

bbd4970c-1f7f-4df6-9570-8643a514dd51-0
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.772
So please order in yourself so that you're fully visible on the

00:27:10.772 --> 00:27:11.210
camera.

9a04b1b6-42a4-4f7e-8222-d3cdafbf73bd-0
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.330
We'll keep the count for you.

85500161-76be-466a-b45e-453248c3b7d1-0

c770d6ee-458f-41ce-8e64-34aec0c2f8ec-0

Now hold yoga Mudra.

b65b4c03-9b73-427c-92ea-6982d7a0cafb-0
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.278
Yoga mudra means the tips of your thumb and pointing fingers

b65b4c03-9b73-427c-92ea-6982d7a0cafb-1
00:27:23.278 --> 00:27:25.270
are touching forming a circle.

43c8b5c3-a3f2-4c77-b5ee-d176d108369f-0
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.350
All the other three fingers are held straight and relax.

a4052eb8-0394-4ae9-9538-c17ed2ed15c0-0
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.910
All the four fingers should be together side by side touching.

02de1b83-740d-415a-b11a-2cea2fd4f3a6-0
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.118

body.

c642ab3d-d75d-4308-b957-f495bf115ac9-0
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.390
Only the mudra should be tight.

fd2a3b22-2908-4296-b9f5-3f599ae286cd-0
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.350
The rest of the arms and shoulders should be loosen.

05d2d1fe-198b-4f51-96a2-ad8969acf81c-0
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.550
Relax now.

39598b80-d787-4d7d-8085-e898fa0427f4-0
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.430
Keep your eyes closed.

a38cf051-f30f-4c1c-b307-0c6e6f771895-0
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.180
None.

Uh uh uh uh uh, None.

2808cd7c-a87c-4ecc-b808-c00defcfddc3-0
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:51.475
You can slowly open your eyes now We'll look at a few common

2808cd7c-a87c-4ecc-b808-c00defcfddc3-1
00:32:51.475 --> 00:32:55.010
corrections for arm chanting.

ff38f043-eec4-4784-8dbd-cf07906e8e3a-0
00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.450
Please observe.

207b7fd0-eeac-4fa2-85f6-08335d5e40ac-0
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.530
Do not keep your arms straight or shoulders tense.

49287fe8-f72b-4e2e-bb84-b6eb6dac09ec-0
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.330
Arms and shoulders should be loosened.

ea419bd2-1453-43c1-9237-8ee59bfe17ea-0
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:15.851
Relax palms on your thighs, close to the knees, elbows close

ea419bd2-1453-43c1-9237-8ee59bfe17ea-1
00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:16.890
to the body.

227b3328-9022-4ac3-816d-37013e80673e-0
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.620
Make sure that you're holding the mudra properly.

acfaf2e3-938b-405d-90e0-7c53639752bb-0
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.220
Some of you are holding it like this or like this.

9c6cf351-08f8-4aa5-8f08-71847685cce3-0
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:43.752
You must make sure it's the very tips that are touching and also

9c6cf351-08f8-4aa5-8f08-71847685cce3-1
00:33:43.752 --> 00:33:50.160
make sure that only the mudra is tight.

3f1ef3c5-a9b0-4df0-8436-6c32fd83989a-0
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.040
The rest of the arms and shoulders should be loosened.

b0209f4a-ae51-4dd4-8b98-15c09ba031d9-0
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.600
Relax and you should hold it somewhat tight, not tense.

d69f00c0-7730-4cdc-a7f5-751543f03461-0
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:05.792
Yes, and there's also a tendency to utter the sound the arm very

d69f00c0-7730-4cdc-a7f5-751543f03461-1
00:34:05.792 --> 00:34:06.490
softly.

aae2dc03-cf40-4a09-a194-740a303923f6-0
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:10.170
You must utter it loud enough to be able to feel the vibration.

ce3df66d-eb8b-4439-83a8-578dc370c7a5-0
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.083
And there's also a tendency to utter the three sounds for

ce3df66d-eb8b-4439-83a8-578dc370c7a5-1
00:34:15.083 --> 00:34:16.090
different duration.

33049843-b4d1-479d-96f6-0d759645e687-0
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:20.652
AO and Mas should be uttered for approximately equal amount of

33049843-b4d1-479d-96f6-0d759645e687-1
00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:20.970
time.

6a064fbb-83ac-4af3-a9a8-f50fd4b4e251-0
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.469
Now we'll be learning one more step of Shamavi Mahamudra

6a064fbb-83ac-4af3-a9a8-f50fd4b4e251-1
00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:27.530
towards the end.

fbf3d7db-b56b-40dc-b581-4ef31345fd47-0
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.490
Sadhguru will guide you through the practice.

a897484d-2c39-4d1c-b8cf-0d7241e94aff-0
00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.431
So when he asks you to close your eyes, please do the

a897484d-2c39-4d1c-b8cf-0d7241e94aff-1
00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:35.910
practice along with his instructions.

9161f32b-f4e7-4102-b5d6-e1aadde2605a-0
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.150
But for now, please keep your eyes open.

ef01b374-1b32-4120-8d4c-f33d98328d70-0
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.670
So the next step.

ac39d017-cefb-478a-83c4-66a054daa03e-0
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.190
We're not going in the order of things.

20b763c2-9cd2-43cd-8d51-4579270ab1d6-0
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:48.150
We're just learning sambavi in bits and pieces.

c2e69919-3dc9-4fec-bd9b-488a2239e276-0
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.270
Tomorrow we will refine all the parts and assemble them.

a108800f-b36f-4783-864d-3158ad4f18f6-0
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.790
We will see what that is.

7cadd8eb-d39a-4172-8ddf-9b3c364a3869-0
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.670
The next dimension is called the bhandas.

e28b0041-0744-4754-9ce3-493ffbc7c6e5-0
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.130
The word bhanda literally means a lock.

11395919-2bee-4fae-88f8-8f36eb5493aa-0
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:07.188
That is, if you apply certain locks in the body and energize

11395919-2bee-4fae-88f8-8f36eb5493aa-1
00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:10.594
it and then apply certain blocks, then the system will

11395919-2bee-4fae-88f8-8f36eb5493aa-2
00:35:10.594 --> 00:35:13.010
function in an entirely different way.

147857ef-1567-4ece-b7a0-ad9e4f30edad-0
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.010
These bandas.

3007dd88-256a-47f4-b10a-e7025d095868-0
00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.290
There are various types of bandas.

25deeaf5-ecc5-46d8-a787-e9aebfe2992c-0
00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.570
Here we will do three basic bandas.

af4e5c50-9297-43b8-8bc4-a54f7c136033-0
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:22.890
These are called.

2ec481af-bc6d-4cf7-b9eb-5695c50f70e5-0
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.186
I will not go into the Sanskrit names because anyway, you can't

2ec481af-bc6d-4cf7-b9eb-5695c50f70e5-1
00:35:28.186 --> 00:35:29.510
remember or pronounce them.

68c59421-ab8e-4d41-8b84-b4f735e60460-0
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.030
One is the neck lock.

9f516181-bf82-4872-920b-65b90cea665a-0
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.590
Another is the diaphragm lock.

918e8063-025f-40f9-a1d4-31f156135e7c-0
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.310
Another is the anal lock.

88518854-76d6-455c-a318-9b56c273bab2-0
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.408
These three locks will create a certain situation within you if

88518854-76d6-455c-a318-9b56c273bab2-1
00:35:40.408 --> 00:35:42.870
you inhale and apply these three locks.

c81d8c52-afe8-4511-b24c-62319394960b-0
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.310
Now breath is no more, just breath.

5716b79a-bc3a-43fd-9785-58213fe32588-0
00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.924
It begins to transform itself into another dimension of

5716b79a-bc3a-43fd-9785-58213fe32588-1
00:35:48.924 --> 00:35:50.830
energy, which is called as ojas.

45347f62-5356-4d87-b5d6-7ea0f51a5e81-0
00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.670
You heard of the word ojas?

c7863713-8b18-41b4-b3e8-e80640e06eb7-0
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.910
Hmm.

0eb23121-2d47-4a6f-a7c2-025c6005ffe0-0
00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.170
Ojas is a non physical dimension of energy.

404375bc-730f-4e6c-866d-5db335f4a7c3-0
00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:02.354
Once you carry a certain amount of ojas around yourself, then

404375bc-730f-4e6c-866d-5db335f4a7c3-1
00:36:02.354 --> 00:36:05.450
you have smooth passage through the world.

603d53c3-e537-4513-8a7d-02dec5086624-0
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:10.980
In the Far East Asian countries they refer to the enlightened

603d53c3-e537-4513-8a7d-02dec5086624-1
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.170
beings as enchi.

dae8a929-b0d0-4676-ae14-c342d48e6070-0
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.490
Enchi literally means a circle.

614ba6db-6a27-4335-b503-a5e0aaa50cc1-0
00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:19.598
This is not because they were round of body, but because why

614ba6db-6a27-4335-b503-a5e0aaa50cc1-1
00:36:19.598 --> 00:36:22.440
do you have circular wheels on your car?

f3caeb58-4032-4639-8bf3-985b45df650d-0
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.600
Why not triangular?

53ac523a-dc4a-43ef-95c8-172f32390500-0
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.200
The triangular wheels would be definitely jazzier.

512302fd-4d0e-48e9-ac7e-dc9ca8683053-0
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.400
Why circular wheels?

bbb44b31-b915-4974-99cb-bd9498f9a78e-0
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.600
Least resistance.

4ef90f1d-5f69-415f-b78a-0f4b97d44a1f-0
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:38.263
Circular wheel produces least amount of resistance, so if you

4ef90f1d-5f69-415f-b78a-0f4b97d44a1f-1
00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:43.233
if you're in a certain state of urges then your passage is

4ef90f1d-5f69-415f-b78a-0f4b97d44a1f-2
00:36:43.233 --> 00:36:44.160
lubricated.

f2b8e92b-1389-46c5-b770-a78fb56296aa-0
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.760
In the world you have no friction.

404a8e54-1a4c-4243-a901-f619362fe54f-0
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.210
You are going through the world with least amount of resistance.

d4cb27e3-2e6f-494c-b48f-df27b40ba0e6-0
00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.490
You will see this happening to lot of people.

9dcac90e-ef0b-46e6-be19-ee1324b82040-0
00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.340
Some people wherever they go, even if they go with good

9dcac90e-ef0b-46e6-be19-ee1324b82040-1
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.730
intention, they will get into frictious situations.

9949b3af-06f2-4ca2-a6c9-cb3b802e6bc3-0
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:03.641
There are other people who simply go on everywhere things

9949b3af-06f2-4ca2-a6c9-cb3b802e6bc3-1
00:37:03.641 --> 00:37:04.610
happen for them.

0f3049d9-fbd8-4d7a-9c1b-1e1d0361d2f5-0
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.290
They go through the world smoothly and come out smoothly.

cac8c085-c056-44aa-aa72-349d1b9510aa-0
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.530
Have you noticed this?

03229a96-0e97-4419-9957-73783a7e4842-0
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:16.799
We we bring certain people to certain types of sadhana or

03229a96-0e97-4419-9957-73783a7e4842-1
00:37:16.799 --> 00:37:21.140
certain types of inner work when they're doing this.

2dd35ecf-a95e-4946-9dcd-470d294f1b85-0
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.879
They're doing this mainly to generate or just when they're

2dd35ecf-a95e-4946-9dcd-470d294f1b85-1
00:37:24.879 --> 00:37:26.020
doing such things.

6012d586-3a60-4e26-ad21-29f1fca53d9e-0
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:33.040
We put them on all fatty diet, OK, ghee butter, lots of carbs,

6012d586-3a60-4e26-ad21-29f1fca53d9e-1
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.940
carbs and everything.

4be448ba-d085-4a43-a048-8e29599656b6-0
00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.220
And the volumes that they eat is almost inhuman.

453036c2-03dd-4716-8904-d1a90552b5ca-0
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.271
We always keep them in a protected space because they

453036c2-03dd-4716-8904-d1a90552b5ca-1
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:45.134
will eat 10 times what they would normally eat heaps of

453036c2-03dd-4716-8904-d1a90552b5ca-2
00:37:45.134 --> 00:37:45.390
food.

a88d13ca-2a3c-4600-96a2-d4fabce41c5e-0
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.828
Other people if they see them they will get scared that

a88d13ca-2a3c-4600-96a2-d4fabce41c5e-1
00:37:49.828 --> 00:37:53.704
something is wrong here and still they will be losing weight

a88d13ca-2a3c-4600-96a2-d4fabce41c5e-2
00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:57.262
because this is a way of transforming physical into non

a88d13ca-2a3c-4600-96a2-d4fabce41c5e-3
00:37:57.262 --> 00:37:58.470
physical dimension.

4fb71c04-dc89-4dbe-a129-01a4ce00537c-0
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.746
In the Yogic lore, very mischievously, this is called a

4fb71c04-dc89-4dbe-a129-01a4ce00537c-1
00:38:02.746 --> 00:38:04.390
stealing from the Earth.

04f82172-0910-4457-9ae2-79a8b784b3a3-0
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.346
Because you have gathered whatever you have gathered from

04f82172-0910-4457-9ae2-79a8b784b3a3-1
00:38:09.346 --> 00:38:10.000
this planet.

f767febf-bd30-4e34-88bb-c2bd9ed04dff-0
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.960
She's quite generous about this.

6dccf82c-b674-4300-9eff-4c01aec4b370-0
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.720
You can gather as much as you want.

0e428af9-85ce-4871-ad65-71992607ad87-0
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:19.931
Some man in Mexico a few years ago he gathered 520 kilograms or

0e428af9-85ce-4871-ad65-71992607ad87-1
00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:23.680
something like that, 500 and odd kilograms.

da6f5947-df14-4b79-beec-cc3ba3dfc22e-0
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.840
So Mother Earth is generous if you're willing to carry.

3430221d-d51c-48c0-9d45-1ddea11ff0ab-0
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.676
She will allow you to carry as much as you want, but when time

3430221d-d51c-48c0-9d45-1ddea11ff0ab-1
00:38:30.676 --> 00:38:33.360
to leave comes, she will collect atom to atom.

2dab24e0-6d3d-431d-a398-79cb5c951674-0
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.870
You have to pay back no interest, but the loan has to be

2dab24e0-6d3d-431d-a398-79cb5c951674-1
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:39.620
paid back.

0453787d-5e73-4fc3-8aec-92ca1e4058eb-0
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.100
So the yogis want to steal from the earth.

c494063b-6af2-4df3-998c-333bb92b70fe-0
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.500
The way to steal is transformed physically into non physical.

38dfaae5-1ad4-47df-8bf2-8194e15fd6a3-0
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.220
Then she can't hold it back.

261b5b7e-4800-4bbe-9448-1df0d35e8a2e-0
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.900
You take this with you.

6c88ac5e-4aed-42f5-8318-2588ba732f51-0
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.887
So this is mischievously referred to as stealing from the

6c88ac5e-4aed-42f5-8318-2588ba732f51-1
00:38:54.887 --> 00:38:56.980
earth generating ojas in the body.

634f1607-9394-4e61-8b2f-d41882706392-0
00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.740
So if you engage bandhas, the breath will not just be breath,

634f1607-9394-4e61-8b2f-d41882706392-1
00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.940
It will start transforming physically into non physical.

6fb42aa9-c4ee-4607-b02d-bc09ea0fdb79-0
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.210
We will do this three simple bandas.

b3e601a2-f848-4442-a323-3cc226e350fc-0
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.890
You may not get it perfectly right.

fedb6cf1-348c-44c9-9e6d-719b076c4a7e-0
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:11.090
Now.

11b50ae9-66d3-4632-8029-a612b222414a-0
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:11.530
It's OK.

c3c7afe1-1eb5-415b-b01f-5e7f9e7ffd1d-0
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.050
Tomorrow morning we will refine this process.

d4dddd65-efe7-4fc4-9bff-6b43a3f6d5e3-0
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:19.290
Right now he will demonstrate the bandas and we will tell you

d4dddd65-efe7-4fc4-9bff-6b43a3f6d5e3-1
00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.810
how to go about it.

3bc4d984-c216-4013-9cdd-89bbf437e50d-0
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.290
These three bandas are referred to.

a8f51407-42e7-4a05-92c1-5b44040059d8-0
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.170
The neck lock is referred to as Jalandhar Banda.

283e8f65-3ef0-410c-baf6-9906e98a0fa5-0
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:30.610
The diaphragm lock is called Udyanabanda.

af345db3-fd01-43c9-af9e-3079e4e36612-0
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.650
The anal lock is called as Mooladharabanda.

f79bb6da-78e6-482d-93d6-c20eb6e3889f-0
00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:13.090
So what's being done is, can you sit sideways with your place?

7a19a2be-5ddd-484f-877d-d85abebc52b5-0
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:15.410
Sideways.

52663a9d-68f2-4f13-87e7-1e835a0a5742-0
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.650
Yeah.

c35d128e-78e3-46e0-b802-15dd2f893843-0
00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:51.477
So what's being done is you sit in Ardasiddasana holding it this

c35d128e-78e3-46e0-b802-15dd2f893843-1
00:42:51.477 --> 00:42:51.740
way.

af499785-2d58-464e-a716-f6ed6c8479ab-0
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.460
What we will do is don't do it yet.

506468a5-94ef-4fdc-a92e-72de6e6d8f21-0
00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.580
Please, just listen.

07db8736-7667-4601-a376-32ab986ce8c9-0
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.740
Those of you wearing spectacles must take it off right now.

a10a0920-9b26-4726-9b5f-f8a19da5114a-0
00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.460
You can keep it on.

b8d2e34e-7cd3-4a24-a72f-8be937675a16-0
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.180
You inhale fully.

08c6e08f-0a83-43a7-a407-14f5a5f90e84-0
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.100
Listen to me.

70d40bba-5674-4119-a434-19d7475be924-0
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.380
Please.

233d1596-e49f-4cb4-9bd9-c651f6e9f747-0
00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:01.820
Please.

f9a4d63e-2b42-48a1-a907-8bc1dc3374d8-0
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.460
You inhale fully.

f7417a06-f4ee-4f68-86c3-2cb6e573b865-0
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.864
After inhalation is complete, take your head back, Tuck your

f7417a06-f4ee-4f68-86c3-2cb6e573b865-1
00:43:07.864 --> 00:43:09.420
chin in, bring it down.

81c0b6c1-d666-456c-a0aa-bd66a72af9c1-0
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.140
There are three moments in this.

9c52f72f-ae68-43fb-9cfd-bd5fad3ad158-0
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.725
Taking your head back, tucking it in, bringing it down, taking

9c52f72f-ae68-43fb-9cfd-bd5fad3ad158-1
00:43:15.725 --> 00:43:20.098
it back, taking your head back, tucking it in, bringing it down

9c52f72f-ae68-43fb-9cfd-bd5fad3ad158-2
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:21.670
means you take it back.

dd9930a5-f026-41d3-9ae8-6991528e3cec-0
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.057
If you tuck the chin in, the chin should go and sit in the

dd9930a5-f026-41d3-9ae8-6991528e3cec-1
00:43:25.057 --> 00:43:26.030
pit of the throat.

4697e468-48db-4aee-a442-b4b8ac24875c-0
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.390
You tuck it in and then bring it down.

a087773b-b5e4-44e1-a2c4-f1557915b8ce-0
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.790
This is Jalandhar bandha or the neck lock.

1a3abe98-efc3-4068-a96e-d427fa31f19e-0
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.510
As soon as you do this, pull the diaphragm in these muscles.

1501bfc9-881e-439b-9298-1ec202fd7a67-0
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:41.857
You pull them in and consciously constrict and pull your anal

1501bfc9-881e-439b-9298-1ec202fd7a67-1
00:43:41.857 --> 00:43:46.222
muscles up and hold it like this and stay there in the fullness

1501bfc9-881e-439b-9298-1ec202fd7a67-2
00:43:46.222 --> 00:43:49.700
of the breath as long as it's comfortable for you.

a99efa82-90c4-4ae1-99aa-5ebf744d5f36-0
00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.060
Stay there as much as you can, but not forcefully.

5a8a55ee-eb73-4411-b4d1-3572c2b5ed51-0
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.540
Stay there as long as it's comfortable for you.

ba9ea2b5-7c04-41f3-b364-f3980d57846c-0
00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.100
When you feel like exhalation, relax.

4af3b798-2693-4825-baaf-e780802774e8-0
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.580
Only the neck lock lock is here.

b8366f9c-351c-433f-819b-9a3f1cc474ca-0
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.380
Relax only the neck lock.

8c6676e2-1ef5-4a38-a156-23380a565eb8-0
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.580
The other two locks are still intact.

ac554301-b7a1-42e0-aa2a-1f2a343dc25d-0
00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:10.180
The diaphragm lock and the anal lock are still there.

475ce8ff-8b4c-462b-9caa-fe06330b157b-0
00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.680
Relax only the neck lock and exhale through the nostrils

475ce8ff-8b4c-462b-9caa-fe06330b157b-1
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.150
after the exhalation is complete.

422c425c-1fb0-430b-b5e7-95daf37ce0b4-0
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.550
Then again, take the head back, tuck the chin in, bring it down.

b67d57fb-262a-421b-ad86-384c66728045-0
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:26.506
That means first time you had applied the locks on the

b67d57fb-262a-421b-ad86-384c66728045-1
00:44:26.506 --> 00:44:27.790
fullness of breath.

c3beed94-6b01-4663-818e-105c24158e87-0
00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:31.889
Second time you're applying the locks on the emptiness of

c3beed94-6b01-4663-818e-105c24158e87-1
00:44:31.889 --> 00:44:32.350
breath.

b201f2fb-ec7d-4766-99b4-11e892a8023d-0
00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.190
First time the breath, the lung was full.

38463a62-19fb-425b-ba7f-ba89d5a521fe-0
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.110
This time it's empty and you're locked.

69520d38-b493-44a0-844c-737404f49777-0
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.310
Stay there as long as it's comfortable.

18d215b6-fa09-4b81-aa1c-caafef63f00b-0
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:43.590
When you feel like inhalation, first bring your head up.

8e68a4fb-4cf1-40b1-a1cd-bbcf9194fc99-0
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:49.011
Inhale only only after the inhalation is complete, you

8e68a4fb-4cf1-40b1-a1cd-bbcf9194fc99-1
00:44:49.011 --> 00:44:50.750
relax the diaphragm.

7083dd93-d8da-492a-888f-424834d478c8-0
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.590
Only after you relax the diaphragm, you relax the analog.

29d5fabc-e34e-43b8-a3ec-e06a5544a8d3-0
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:56.590
Is this clear to you?

43c5386e-3edc-48a0-adf4-246c9903748c-0
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.230
I'll repeat again, please listen.

38f4a808-1b5d-42e9-b947-cacf55e24989-0
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:00.430
This is important.

3d228d93-b8ed-4395-aea3-b06cc95f5b81-0
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:01.510
You get these things right.

34502ccb-bed6-4120-987b-45d8cb15a378-0
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:07.710
Sitting in yoga mudra in Ardasana Ardasiddhasana posture.

d27b4211-0443-41ed-9ea8-8cbaae2df204-0
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.430
You inhale fully.

a0e48277-5630-4160-adb6-6bf79b6bef07-0
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.810
After the inhalation is complete, take your head back,

a0e48277-5630-4160-adb6-6bf79b6bef07-1
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.480
tuck your chin and bring it down.

2f0cc31b-0a73-43cb-8308-7fd870aaaa5a-0
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.080
There are three moments, but it need not happen too slowly.

d2357e7a-517d-427d-a8de-80d32f38af2c-0
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.760
It's not necessary to take it back and wait.

e7e71ed6-ba23-4ebb-a2e3-5dd194728cf1-0
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.868
You're taking it back only to facilitate the tucking in of the

e7e71ed6-ba23-4ebb-a2e3-5dd194728cf1-1
00:45:24.868 --> 00:45:25.160
chin.

e339a245-1a17-424c-a609-b05257a8e40c-0
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.320
There will be a tendency that you go back.

257b5cc8-4ff6-401b-a704-5d88840f3251-0
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.280
Come here, tuck it in.

2af36416-1dbe-4afd-8e6d-c1c5ab85193e-0
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.320
It's no use.

5615c826-6543-40bd-9735-640834881a02-0

b65a5680-00a3-4a7a-81f2-88a28616a7fd-1
00:53:16.946 --> 00:53:19.550
head back, tuck your chin in and bring it down.

adc75657-90ae-4deb-ab4f-8293d61248fe-0
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:24.205
Now stay there in the emptiness of breath as long as it is

adc75657-90ae-4deb-ab4f-8293d61248fe-1
00:53:24.205 --> 00:53:25.350
comfortable for you.

a94bcf6c-efee-4a7d-8865-1c3d0e678279-0
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.680
When you feel like you need to inhale, bring your head up.

6295c139-b605-47ad-9362-99b8c48e17a7-0
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.000
Inhale through the nozzles only.

287ced1c-3649-46ca-a2d2-a3e9db97e29f-0
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.011
After the inhalation is complete, relax the there from

287ced1c-3649-46ca-a2d2-a3e9db97e29f-1
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:40.200
and then relax the and a lock.

9d5edbc6-4cab-4434-b098-978604c3cf2d-0
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:50.440
You can slowly open your eyes so when you do the bandes you can.

af039bc9-3d96-4941-b56d-b429f6a4eab8-0
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.880
You should only do it once.

b8798395-a4a2-43ed-ae42-b910b119a3d9-0
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.760
Once on fullness of breath and once on emptiness of breath.

a3507b1c-eeb4-4511-bc60-25afb78ddf1b-0
00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:01.185
So do not engage the bandas repeatedly and it might takes a

a3507b1c-eeb4-4511-bc60-25afb78ddf1b-1
00:54:01.185 --> 00:54:04.140
few days for the body to cooperate.

86a4ed32-ab3f-4adf-92f0-c72d9d8ab491-0
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.165
So if you have not gotten the you cannot do the practice

86a4ed32-ab3f-4adf-92f0-c72d9d8ab491-1
00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:10.180
properly right now, it is fine.

5184df2d-ae0e-4ed1-91c4-409e885481db-0
00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.706
We'll be reviewing it again tomorrow before start group

5184df2d-ae0e-4ed1-91c4-409e885481db-1
00:54:13.706 --> 00:54:16.807
sessions and tomorrow we'll also be reviewing all of the

5184df2d-ae0e-4ed1-91c4-409e885481db-2
00:54:16.807 --> 00:54:18.820
practices and instructions together.

4a1364c0-2dee-4bb0-bbb1-cad36ac91dca-0
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:26.380
So this is the last a practice that we will learn today.

ebc1aecc-f3c2-42d1-994f-85a3c0c7c89a-0
00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:30.202
So now we'll recap all the practices that we have learned

ebc1aecc-f3c2-42d1-994f-85a3c0c7c89a-1
00:54:30.202 --> 00:54:30.620
so far.

1e71ddde-c18f-45c1-9f7c-a86a3ba383b2-0
00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:35.420
The 1st is the three preparatory steps for Shambhavi Mahamudra.

0368d86c-ccef-4bba-bdd3-032ac3d42f89-0
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.140
The first step is Patangasana or butterfly.

54224ad8-0e29-47a6-b1e0-0b218ec0bc0a-0
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:44.207

677107fc-9edc-4254-8ac3-32e6f16388ca-0

And the last preparatory asanas is Nadi V Bachan or the cat

677107fc-9edc-4254-8ac3-32e6f16388ca-1
00:54:53.483 --> 00:54:53.940
stretch.

3bccbc99-ad92-4642-acf7-d66a01f9481c-0
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.290
It's a series of 10 posture.

0afcd4b1-79ae-441e-a08b-84e9bad931c5-0
00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:58.610
You do 3 cycles of Nadi Ubaijan.

4bc5eeab-ef7a-4bfb-85d0-ca431930580a-0
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:03.862
And we've also started learning the various steps of Shambhavi

4bc5eeab-ef7a-4bfb-85d0-ca431930580a-1
00:55:03.862 --> 00:55:04.410
Mahamudra.

5137212e-c05f-4db2-a89a-b78d57ece3cb-0
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:08.353
You'll be first, you'll be sitting in Ardas Siddhasana and

5137212e-c05f-4db2-a89a-b78d57ece3cb-1
00:55:08.353 --> 00:55:10.890
you'll do Suka Kriya for six to seven minutes.

292dfee4-bf9e-45ae-9806-e00ab73da1a6-0
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:15.862
If you have blocked nostrils, you do the jogging first for a

292dfee4-bf9e-45ae-9806-e00ab73da1a6-1
00:55:15.862 --> 00:55:18.530
minute or two, let the breath settles.

6bdc7718-15b6-4f8e-9f79-ab44d8051ae2-0
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:22.170
And only after the breath settles, you start Suka Kriya.

fcb16c56-ebbf-48a9-8ce5-656bea504bbf-0
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.150
You do Suka Kriya for six to seven minutes.

49c3e7d0-bd07-45a5-a880-3b5590dd1bc1-0
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:30.804
Then you'll be sitting in other Siddhasana holding yoga mudra

49c3e7d0-bd07-45a5-a880-3b5590dd1bc1-1
00:55:30.804 --> 00:55:33.750
and you'll be uttering AAM 21
times.

061bb685-b712-40a9-8d75-9943f1a93ea1-0
00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:39.097
We've also learned one more steps of Shambhavi Mahamudra,

061bb685-b712-40a9-8d75-9943f1a93ea1-1
00:55:39.097 --> 00:55:40.390
which is the bandas.

083c2e32-0064-40c9-9862-7be00306c4ba-0
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:44.581
You only engage the bandas once, once on fullness of breath and

083c2e32-0064-40c9-9862-7be00306c4ba-1
00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:46.310
once on emptiness of breath.

c5178167-4aa8-444b-9fbf-36278d8fe7b4-0
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.990
So we are learning the practice in bits and pieces.

f9a8d6e6-1056-459f-b3b9-393261c281a9-0
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:54.319
Right now we'll be is seeing how to put them together tomorrow

f9a8d6e6-1056-459f-b3b9-393261c281a9-1
00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:58.579
and tomorrow we'll also be going through all of the practices

f9a8d6e6-1056-459f-b3b9-393261c281a9-2
00:55:58.579 --> 00:56:02.840
again and we'll be reviewing all the instructions in details.

1fb392ee-0a0e-472b-b9bd-385296e8be3a-0
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.578
So right now if is there any questions right now, if you have

1fb392ee-0a0e-472b-b9bd-385296e8be3a-1
00:56:07.578 --> 00:56:11.582
any questions now the Q&amp;A mode is enabled, you can type

1fb392ee-0a0e-472b-b9bd-385296e8be3a-2
00:56:11.582 --> 00:56:14.720
your questions and we have we'll go over them.

51ed1766-48e8-464e-b2ae-51f3663fbeaf-0
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:19.569
So one thing is please make sure that you don't drink water in

51ed1766-48e8-464e-b2ae-51f3663fbeaf-1
00:56:19.569 --> 00:56:20.760
between the practices.

925c7feb-4ff1-49c3-a560-b407ed7dd3f9-0
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:26.822
You might have noticed that when you do yoga there's some heat in

925c7feb-4ff1-49c3-a560-b407ed7dd3f9-1
00:56:26.822 --> 00:56:27.590
the body.

e6ab52ee-00e6-49d9-bfec-4ff2a822f7f3-0
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:31.789
So if you drink water at that time, the body temperature will

e6ab52ee-00e6-49d9-bfec-4ff2a822f7f3-1
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:35.660
goes down rapidly and this can make you more susceptible to

e6ab52ee-00e6-49d9-bfec-4ff2a822f7f3-2
00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.950
allergic condition, catching cold or excess mucus.

380919f0-f328-43fa-a867-841dba11de9d-0
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:52.830
This question is from Majud.

f7651431-4971-4095-8730-f2705df73260-0
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:56.950
What about Upay Yoga and Namaskar?

7659d8df-22ad-49a7-ae25-73cf24e3ea6e-0
00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.960
Is it necessary with Shambhavi?

cbba76e7-5b83-408d-b8ca-d4061e780cc7-0
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:08.167
So UPA Yoga and Yoga mascara, if you it's you can do it before

cbba76e7-5b83-408d-b8ca-d4061e780cc7-1
00:57:08.167 --> 00:57:09.000
Shambhavi.

7c151672-a26d-4fa6-bebf-5959af8f3f8a-0
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.720
So it's best that you do it before Shambhavi.

477ca48a-0541-4d77-ad15-d038dc48bee3-0
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:12.640
It will be.

90e5a7cb-7b72-4ea7-ba65-77ec72e9ee23-0
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.760
It will also help to prepare the body better.

ac7c1226-ee27-4eaf-9321-96a0450fc7e6-0
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:15.440
Yes.

a3520088-3eb1-40b6-b9d6-ac94bd92a464-0
00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.866
So if you want to do it with the Shambhavi, so it means that you

a3520088-3eb1-40b6-b9d6-ac94bd92a464-1
00:57:18.866 --> 00:57:21.856
start with UPA yoga and then yoga and a mascara and then the

a3520088-3eb1-40b6-b9d6-ac94bd92a464-2
00:57:21.856 --> 00:57:24.160
prepetory asanas and then Shambhavi Mahamudra.

e9355b2a-d958-4498-8652-cfb0e86db0f7-0
00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:31.300
This question is from Gadambini.

ecf66be4-3ecf-4c40-9a75-95d3bbe9e149-0
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:39.699
Suka Kriya was not clear to me, so I'll repeat the instructions

ecf66be4-3ecf-4c40-9a75-95d3bbe9e149-1
00:57:39.699 --> 00:57:41.340
for Suka Kriya.

94989c5b-f69c-4fc4-8a94-9ad83255cc03-0
00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:45.140
So how we do Suka Kriya is you use only the right hand.

313ecbd5-e20c-4ea4-a0e3-eb237c1594ce-0
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:49.368
The left hand is placed loosely placed in the middle of your lap

313ecbd5-e20c-4ea4-a0e3-eb237c1594ce-1
00:57:49.368 --> 00:57:50.340
palms facing up.

e2c39246-8869-4fe7-98cd-a8ee291747b7-0
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.300
So you use only the right hand.

a6e13e31-498f-44d4-982c-31304f01fa19-0
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:57.100
So you close the right nostril with the thumb and exhale

a6e13e31-498f-44d4-982c-31304f01fa19-1
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.030
through the left nostrils.

d86f803b-c3dc-40cf-9dd5-bb9e7a886d2f-0
00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:01.750
And then you inhale through the same nostrils.

3f7d852b-5941-478d-a5fe-a5cab92e3fb1-0
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.175
close the left nostril with the little finger and open the

3f7d852b-5941-478d-a5fe-a5cab92e3fb1-1
00:58:06.175 --> 00:58:10.080
right, exhale to the right, inhale to the right, close the

3f7d852b-5941-478d-a5fe-a5cab92e3fb1-2
00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.390
right and open the left, exhale through the left.

7170f641-a557-4e12-9469-fbe2dc8c0a58-0
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:15.190
And like this you continue.

90401b80-0102-4b8f-b5a3-aa79eaf26b34-0
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:18.550
So when you do Suka Kriya you only have to remember 2 things.

95370392-08ad-4c16-b77e-7c26a64e4688-0
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:23.149
You always start and end the creas with an exhalation through

95370392-08ad-4c16-b77e-7c26a64e4688-1
00:58:23.149 --> 00:58:26.946
the left nostrils, and you switch nostrils only after

95370392-08ad-4c16-b77e-7c26a64e4688-2
00:58:26.946 --> 00:58:27.720
inhalation.

6b94c415-e169-4395-80af-86d7cc54fb19-0
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:32.000
So I hope that will clarify the instruction for Suka Crea.

5cb32d28-b9c0-4180-9802-c12523c3d5e6-0
00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.080
This question is from Himeka.

db533e1f-f3c8-4c13-a6eb-163d5b1ac2f6-0
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.560
Can you repeat repeat the step for bandas?

e2e7fa01-0ad2-4c2f-8bf6-0b522c7ac38e-0
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:50.110
OK, so how to engage the bandas is you have to sit in and you'll

e2e7fa01-0ad2-4c2f-8bf6-0b522c7ac38e-1
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:52.260
be holding yoga mudra.

b46f668f-6093-4dd8-8b29-a03f6d9a5fcd-0
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.740
So you inhale fully.

ae053168-cb4e-4a32-8a45-aee921d90b1c-0
00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.524
So you inhale fully, take your head back, tuck your chin in and

ae053168-cb4e-4a32-8a45-aee921d90b1c-1
00:58:58.524 --> 00:58:59.300
bring it down.

d74a02c0-47ea-41d3-bcdf-6cfbe9ef4d80-0
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:04.621
And then as soon as you do this, constrict, pull it there from

d74a02c0-47ea-41d3-bcdf-6cfbe9ef4d80-1
00:59:04.621 --> 00:59:04.820
in.

cf9c8004-d3cb-4feb-98e7-e608b44341f2-0
00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.440
Constrict the inner muscles and pull them up so you stay there

cf9c8004-d3cb-4feb-98e7-e608b44341f2-1
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.455
in the fullness of breath as long as it is comfortable for

cf9c8004-d3cb-4feb-98e7-e608b44341f2-2
00:59:11.455 --> 00:59:11.660
you.

2826a734-5781-41f1-977f-dee617894819-0
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:15.548
When you feel like you need to exhale, relax only the neck

2826a734-5781-41f1-977f-dee617894819-1
00:59:15.548 --> 00:59:15.810
lock.

de321886-47c4-4687-9a25-12923ffaec4c-0
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:17.610
The other two locks are still intact.

2413acb8-e78d-4107-a5e7-fa6ba4796d7c-0
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:22.313
You relax only the neck lock and then you exhale through the

2413acb8-e78d-4107-a5e7-fa6ba4796d7c-1
00:59:22.313 --> 00:59:22.930
nostles.

49429bd9-e5c5-4cd3-ba90-1b0bb992a5aa-0
00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:26.952
After exhalation is complete once again, take your head back,

49429bd9-e5c5-4cd3-ba90-1b0bb992a5aa-1
00:59:26.952 --> 00:59:29.090
tuck your chin in and bring it down.

b30fd4ef-51c9-4813-8415-1354a2921ae7-0
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:32.519
Now you stay there in the emptiness of breath as long as

b30fd4ef-51c9-4813-8415-1354a2921ae7-1
00:59:32.519 --> 00:59:33.810
it is comfortable for you.

82709457-cf62-4108-8cf1-7f06e4edd8d9-0
00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:38.537
When you feel like you, when you feel like you need to inhale,

82709457-cf62-4108-8cf1-7f06e4edd8d9-1
00:59:38.537 --> 00:59:39.770
bring your head up.

d16a6043-b279-4b9c-b6ac-7cb3abb28291-0
00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:41.850
Inhale through the nostles.

d02fcfee-2b3e-4043-9f57-b66b1864367a-0
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:45.890
After inhalation is complete, then you relax the diaphragm.

f3192902-e5f4-446e-9938-12cf76a29988-0
00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:50.366
Only after you relax the diaphragm you relax and a lock,

f3192902-e5f4-446e-9938-12cf76a29988-1
00:59:50.366 --> 00:59:50.650
Yes.

2c24f864-1d32-48b5-9307-14be1a039a87-0
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:54.764
So when you engage the lock for is first is the neck lock and

2c24f864-1d32-48b5-9307-14be1a039a87-1
00:59:54.764 --> 00:59:57.890
then the diaphragm lock and then the and a lock.

453a8b02-6ecb-48bd-8693-0ac3feff5ca8-0
00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:02.443
When you release it, first is the neck lock and then the

453a8b02-6ecb-48bd-8693-0ac3feff5ca8-1
01:00:02.443 --> 01:00:05.330

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:07.210
So it should happen in this order.

128dd8f1-3729-418c-b90e-2914240db150-0
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.450
This question is from Julie.

8eaeda76-0081-4490-bf5a-deb82d4c6d20-0
01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:19.840
Clear is exhalation silence before releasing bandas.

6b572232-775c-4eaa-a101-193b9e27a2eb-0
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.600
So can you repeat the question?

aae328cf-0845-4dc4-9194-9b7992ad780a-0
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.040
Is the exhalation silence?

39ca3840-8bb4-4cc4-b1dd-5b5d347541a9-0
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.120
Should there be any sound from the throat while exhalation?

25609993-77eb-4a9b-afa8-fc011984fbc1-0
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.316
So when you do the when you do bandas, the exhalation, there's

25609993-77eb-4a9b-afa8-fc011984fbc1-1
01:00:36.316 --> 01:00:38.240
no sound from the pit of the throat.

2613c4bc-b6c4-4861-b802-792e43a7da67-0
01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.600
Yes, it's just normal, no sound.

b72dabd6-8074-4918-af35-be97fa4735e1-0
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:49.210
This question is from Dinesh.

eeb1885f-af47-4ddf-82d9-10e6ef8cd23f-0
01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.610
Is it OK to wear short for Shambhavi Mahamudra?

e61aa686-b9ce-4c04-926a-8a3e69931e93-0
01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:58.632
So when you do Shambhavi Mahamudra, you just have to wear

e61aa686-b9ce-4c04-926a-8a3e69931e93-1
01:00:58.632 --> 01:01:00.530
something that is comfortable for you.

c1443f5f-96bb-4b37-84da-df7ef12ea716-0
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:03.690
So make sure that it's loose and comfortable.

1a3b4e37-d292-4028-88e7-2754b6af269c-0
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.010
So otherwise there's no restriction.

ef435fb3-b8d4-4461-b9fe-7af001124662-0
01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.170
This question is from Vyas.

b50422e7-483a-4db2-889f-e04b3ebe231c-0
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:16.170
Are we going to get access to the video for review?

3178f376-70d4-4f6f-8db3-c7c866f1d43a-0
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:22.334
So we'll be reviewing all of the instructions and the practices

3178f376-70d4-4f6f-8db3-c7c866f1d43a-1

01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:26.938
So don't worry if you have not gotten the practices properly

7f379987-2179-422a-a624-89f6d416e299-1
01:01:26.938 --> 01:01:30.090

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:34.261
But after the program, there will be support along the way

175c5962-1211-4236-bf48-4ead4cc89b99-1
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:35.810
that we'll be covering.

fcc3bb01-4ec1-446b-8e29-ff40dc75e759-0
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.833
We'll go over them tomorrow on all of the supports that will be

fcc3bb01-4ec1-446b-8e29-ff40dc75e759-1

And in terms of Sad Guru's videos, once the program is

01:01:44.881 --> 01:01:48.743
over, there will also be a lot of deep dive video that you can

305adde8-1514-4817-8d44-96972a25d0f5-2

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:55.990
This question is from Meenan.

207bef8b-3fe4-498b-a30c-697ed379c896-0
01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:01.014
I'm not flexible enough to do the preparatory asanas and body

207bef8b-3fe4-498b-a30c-697ed379c896-1
01:02:01.014 --> 01:02:04.030
is not allowing me to sit in Arthasita asana.

873022ef-463b-4aa8-8521-f207478f3b91-0
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:05.190
What can I do?

08c65c5a-bc95-4658-b5a3-f8a77e4c1e1e-0
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:13.631
So if your body is not flexible enough, all you can do is just

08c65c5a-bc95-4658-b5a3-f8a77e4c1e1e-1
01:02:13.631 --> 01:02:14.650
keep doing it.

9d49ed27-ae2b-4eb1-8c94-21951a16729e-0
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:17.984
The beautiful thing about the body is the more you use it, the

9d49ed27-ae2b-4eb1-8c94-21951a16729e-1
01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:18.770
better it works.

e46f1861-d718-4208-8810-a4b7dce26ef3-0
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:19.010
Yes.

4473ea93-efe7-402c-b92d-d2bcd664646e-0
01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:22.290
So the more you practice, the more effortless it will become.

55eb374f-0412-476a-8148-701af55b01f7-0
01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:26.115
So don't get discouraged if you know right now it's not

55eb374f-0412-476a-8148-701af55b01f7-1
01:02:26.115 --> 01:02:26.850
cooperating.

5a174339-87d9-41a4-a6f1-57430806f91b-0
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:30.410
As much you'll see, the more you practice it, it will come.

0c2d1454-362c-4399-9b14-7f22daf53b6d-0
01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:31.010

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.970
So all it takes is just continuous practice.

be9c9121-8ef4-48fc-9fab-9c8f3b020655-0
01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:38.130
And So what is the second question?

0cf982a6-a4e5-4d75-9e0c-6be5287c5c56-0
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:43.007

do is you can use the cushion.

8ecafd8d-302a-481a-a968-d814c37fd012-0
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:46.890

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:49.614
You can sit just on the edge of the cushion and leave your legs

1a0e16e2-71f8-439f-b872-3dd17947ba45-1
01:02:49.614 --> 01:02:50.210
on the ground.

1bf47b22-eb50-42ad-aa3c-03fe51f82cf0-0
01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.955
And if you still find that your thighs are not touching the

1bf47b22-eb50-42ad-aa3c-03fe51f82cf0-1
01:02:53.955 --> 01:02:56.841
ground, you can also put a cushion just below your thighs

1bf47b22-eb50-42ad-aa3c-03fe51f82cf0-2
01:02:56.841 --> 01:02:59.826
so that you can maximize the surface area of the body which

1bf47b22-eb50-42ad-aa3c-03fe51f82cf0-3
01:02:59.826 --> 01:03:01.170
is in touch with the floor.

01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:06.690
Please don't hesitate, don't be shy.

b234f3a5-3eeb-4a53-bdf0-66b3669d3ec7-0
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:10.457
It is very important that you can sit comfortably in other

for now.

e2b32f5b-2ded-43b5-8f7b-7674f444a0c4-0
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:24.736
This question is from Daniel Jones for the stomach lock, do I

e2b32f5b-2ded-43b5-8f7b-7674f444a0c4-1
01:03:24.736 --> 01:03:28.110

Can you repeat?

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:21.810
This is not an intellectual process.

4ede387c-b71b-49ac-88bd-96b73d2bb7b8-0
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:24.330

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.798
So right now this is probably your first time engaging this

b5835ac1-9e8a-4a2a-928b-29db0a60bd78-1
01:04:57.798 --> 01:04:58.220

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.140
So your body might not be cooperating.

1f25a50e-2f85-45ce-b386-bce419f7b886-0
01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.060
It is all right.

01:05:05.758 --> 01:05:08.580
clear on how to engage the bandas, it is OK.

26b4ec58-64a1-497b-b9f3-c62957651bd0-0
01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.836
The body will, it will take some time for the body to cooperate

26b4ec58-64a1-497b-b9f3-c62957651bd0-1
01:05:11.836 --> 01:05:14.685
and we'll anyway we'll be reviewing it again, again and

26b4ec58-64a1-497b-b9f3-c62957651bd0-2
01:05:14.685 --> 01:05:15.500
again and again.

f6a8ade2-4008-4a06-a2cf-aa7fb5d9d79d-0
01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:20.820
Yes, this question is from Kavita.

b0ed6f80-7960-432d-9ab2-d7e542f3865b-0
01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.750
I have surgery planned it in 21
days.

7c03e5da-5edb-433f-b2f9-1f344cdcd20b-0
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:31.102
Can I do sham movie Kriya for 21
days and continue later after my

7c03e5da-5edb-433f-b2f9-1f344cdcd20b-1
01:05:31.102 --> 01:05:31.790
surgery.

b56d0fa1-80eb-4b34-91f7-508e877dd867-0
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:37.984
So you can definitely do it before your before your surgery,

b56d0fa1-80eb-4b34-91f7-508e877dd867-1
01:05:37.984 --> 01:05:41.755
but in terms of whether you can do it after your surgery, I

b56d0fa1-80eb-4b34-91f7-508e877dd867-2
01:05:41.755 --> 01:05:45.590
think we'll have to look at what kind of surgery that you're

b56d0fa1-80eb-4b34-91f7-508e877dd867-3
01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:46.470
going through.

0781a744-9106-44f9-bb8d-8a9b7d1b7e2d-0
01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:51.823
So for this, please reach out to us and we'll we'll guide you

0781a744-9106-44f9-bb8d-8a9b7d1b7e2d-1
01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:52.870
step by step.

a2043b78-2bef-4930-8a4a-435db4478269-0
01:05:53.030 --> 01:06:08.170
Yes, this question is from Ismail.

61d04027-5fb2-4d46-b1b7-7bcf98b3c6ab-0
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:13.498
When you need to put your attention to the base of the

61d04027-5fb2-4d46-b1b7-7bcf98b3c6ab-1
01:06:13.498 --> 01:06:18.210
spine during butterfly and rock your baby, where is it exactly?

437c2af2-b8ce-4188-9bae-44d2babc31a2-0
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.650
I can't feel anything.

39f022e1-2368-425c-936f-2e05f62b202b-0
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.726
So right now when you do the butterfly or patangas, the

39f022e1-2368-425c-936f-2e05f62b202b-1
01:06:26.726 --> 01:06:30.120
butterfly patangasana or the rock, the baby sichu palasana.

99180954-0781-4ccf-8731-8694ac05f133-0
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.868
So right now you might not be able to feel it because you

99180954-0781-4ccf-8731-8694ac05f133-1
01:06:34.868 --> 01:06:38.549
probably are feeling the pains in your legs instead of feeling

99180954-0781-4ccf-8731-8694ac05f133-2
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:41.120
the the sensation at the base of the spine.

4a033270-e3ec-4faf-afcd-2b64bafbd66f-0
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.049
So as you become more flexible you will be able to sense,

4a033270-e3ec-4faf-afcd-2b64bafbd66f-1
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:48.599
you'll be able to to feel the sensation at the base of the

4a033270-e3ec-4faf-afcd-2b64bafbd66f-2
01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:48.960
spine.

fe52ea6f-3308-4fa2-906c-dc6b99d6195d-0
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.718
So, but for now, you just focus your attention to the base of

fe52ea6f-3308-4fa2-906c-dc6b99d6195d-1
01:06:52.718 --> 01:06:53.280
the spine.

f6eb22a5-f5e9-4642-a03a-12c91e4c52de-0
01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.130
This question is from Ukasha.

5c2bba21-21f0-4946-9e39-b277a5d2c8f9-0
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:06.981
Can we take a can we take a break between the preparatory

5c2bba21-21f0-4946-9e39-b277a5d2c8f9-1
01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:09.770
steps and the Shambhavi Muhammadar Kriya?

869dc2fc-9491-43b0-9718-8379a191bbf3-0
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:15.738
So between the preparatory steps and Shambhavi Mahamudra it

869dc2fc-9491-43b0-9718-8379a191bbf3-1
01:07:15.738 --> 01:07:18.290
should be done in one one sitting, in one go.

30ebcdcf-c3c5-446f-a7ea-065a26b9d02f-0
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:20.370
So there shouldn't be any break in between.

d679bb0d-3ac7-4feb-9433-cb8020d758bc-0
01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:24.370
This question is from Tao.

633cf3d0-5007-404f-b9cb-de3718e5e56c-0
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:30.754
Do I have to go through all the preparatory steps whenever I

633cf3d0-5007-404f-b9cb-de3718e5e56c-1
01:07:30.754 --> 01:07:32.950
practice Shambhui Mahamudra?

825514cb-70b8-42c9-b819-271774725ea7-0
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.430
Yes.

8dd77e7f-4019-4615-b16b-a31eddec644d-0
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:37.950
So all of the preparatory steps you have to do them.

e5cc4397-114d-4467-9ee2-2f5ac796a813-0
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:40.270
You have to do it before the Shambhavi.

5ac6a221-03d0-40a3-8797-a442e685e6b7-0
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:41.790
This will prepare your body.

95af5bab-c97e-4a86-9641-ebc8f923e057-0
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:45.065
You will see that if you do this, your experience of

95af5bab-c97e-4a86-9641-ebc8f923e057-1
01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:48.897
Shambhavi will be much better because you will be able to sit

95af5bab-c97e-4a86-9641-ebc8f923e057-2
01:07:48.897 --> 01:07:52.790
much longer and your body will be more open and receptive when

95af5bab-c97e-4a86-9641-ebc8f923e057-3
01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:54.150
you sit for Shambhavi.

8c8bb2d1-5a5a-426f-8e4b-bdee11906f9f-0
01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.220
This question is from Karen.

dd320cbf-20bd-4186-ac93-e8d30eb44aa9-0
01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:09.456
Is it better to sit on the chair comfortably and do Shambhavi or

dd320cbf-20bd-4186-ac93-e8d30eb44aa9-1
01:08:09.456 --> 01:08:13.698
try to sit in Arthasita sana even if not comfortable and

dd320cbf-20bd-4186-ac93-e8d30eb44aa9-2
01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:14.740
wrong posture.

26b410e8-7710-4fb0-be00-deaf24401d8d-0
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:20.446
So ideally you'll be sitting in Arthasita Sana to do the

26b410e8-7710-4fb0-be00-deaf24401d8d-1
01:08:20.446 --> 01:08:21.020
Shambhavi.

f5dc5da7-3363-428c-a5b1-23fed51e2e5f-0
01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:25.170
If it's not comfortable, you can use as many cushion as possible.

573528d1-b7a1-4f31-8d98-f187b0b1e5e2-0
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:29.850
So the more you practice, it will get better over time.

29764123-9df3-4c6d-8526-46b0c77c2b12-0
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:34.149
Yes, So you only use the chair only when you have an injury or

29764123-9df3-4c6d-8526-46b0c77c2b12-1
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:37.728
a physical condition that prevents you from sitting in

29764123-9df3-4c6d-8526-46b0c77c2b12-2
01:08:37.728 --> 01:08:38.770
other sudhesana.

68b81863-fbcd-4b46-88a2-29ea677d2d9b-0
01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:42.250
This is not the best way to sit but you.

828132c4-50ae-4aa1-aa19-a7bfb535cc16-0
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.274
So that's why you only use it when you have something that

828132c4-50ae-4aa1-aa19-a7bfb535cc16-1
01:08:45.274 --> 01:08:47.570
prevents you from sitting in other sudhesana.

3cfa1f94-d877-4bd3-acb3-797896c76757-0
01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:51.118
Otherwise you should be sitting in other sudhesana and use as

3cfa1f94-d877-4bd3-acb3-797896c76757-1
01:08:51.118 --> 01:08:53.020
many cushion support as possible.

bf1d9ca0-ccc6-41f4-beb0-39e5f2d6e190-0
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:57.740
It might take some time to get comfortable, so I will say just

bf1d9ca0-ccc6-41f4-beb0-39e5f2d6e190-1
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.220
continue to practice.

e2c37354-2b42-42fc-98af-fb11f8820678-0
01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:05.392
Whenever you have time in a day you can sit in other suggests on

e2c37354-2b42-42fc-98af-fb11f8820678-1
01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:08.860
a yes, this question is from Stanley.

852ebfa4-1035-4720-8d37-c14e4472d877-0
01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:14.980
Please clarify the instruction for rock your baby.

47867d82-6a42-4f2a-864b-9c7ec1616f96-0
01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:23.010
OK, so the instructions for Rock your baby or shishu Pasana first

47867d82-6a42-4f2a-864b-9c7ec1616f96-1
01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:27.410
is you take your right foot and place it in your left heel.

0df3f8ae-6217-43d9-9234-ca5f828fedb8-0
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.890
I'm sorry.

4cac0e3b-ba54-456c-9cbf-da343cefd88e-0
01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:30.810
Take your right foot and place it in your left elbow.

0220b9a0-2864-4643-8765-e13561a36d06-0
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.690
Take your right elbow and put it around your right knee.

25afcf10-144b-4d91-b27f-311c24b2bf1d-0
01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:36.850
Clasp your hands and hug your leg close to you.

aa0a6339-7e25-429a-b581-bb50e052a7c2-0
01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:38.370
close your eyes.

dbee9e34-e40b-4a98-bd0c-b2fa56bfaf50-0
01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:41.450
And then you rock your baby.

9fff78bb-f830-4f16-8864-aee25f7a2504-0
01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:41.970
Yes.

d20854e2-8cf5-4d51-a389-19d9f0a4d89d-0
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.530
So you do this slowly and gently, like you rock a baby.

c7f37e4b-4c23-4b33-94a3-8ff1fb3184e5-0
01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:47.914
You'll do 2 minutes for the right leg and then two minutes

c7f37e4b-4c23-4b33-94a3-8ff1fb3184e5-1
01:09:47.914 --> 01:09:48.820
for the left leg.

7a5e57b2-2ec9-4534-9afe-ea2c5aa16a1c-0
01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.500
And we'll also be reviewing this once again tomorrow.

d8b76d89-bb98-4b5a-8b53-c316dc904f8f-0
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.580
So if you're still not clear, we'll go over it tomorrow again.

1c0cb238-6261-410c-8058-bbd9d7e83047-0
01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.060
Yeah, so don't, don't worry about it.

07c89d3e-ced8-465d-91d7-c2271a1fd728-0
01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:58.260
Yeah.

0e7f41a0-10e6-4382-a907-e6725d41ff4a-0
01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.700
This question is from Hauger.

4c7d279a-4ea0-4ce5-baf3-31141a38de7c-0
01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:09.194
I do not want to make a lot of sound, a lot of noise during arm

4c7d279a-4ea0-4ce5-baf3-31141a38de7c-1
01:10:09.194 --> 01:10:12.260
chanting before because my family is sleeping.

c5944f76-b751-4d14-97f4-4a18ed96fbae-0
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.500
Do you have any suggestion for this?

b09e93cf-2797-4311-b550-8e1db57f9b4f-0
01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:21.548
So when you do arm chanting you have to utter it loud enough for

b09e93cf-2797-4311-b550-8e1db57f9b4f-1
01:10:21.548 --> 01:10:25.195
you to be able to feel the vibration from just beneath the

b09e93cf-2797-4311-b550-8e1db57f9b4f-2
01:10:25.195 --> 01:10:27.050
navel to the tips of the nose?

6a0618a8-9d83-407e-934c-26375a60bc13-0
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.170
Yes.

ea388e85-b99c-409a-ac8d-c4a16c1d2376-0
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:31.129
So you definitely have to make sure that you chant it loud

ea388e85-b99c-409a-ac8d-c4a16c1d2376-1
01:10:31.129 --> 01:10:31.490
enough.

8a2cfc41-d08d-46fa-a0a4-bfa857abafbd-0
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:34.101
It doesn't have to be very very loud, but it has to be loud

8a2cfc41-d08d-46fa-a0a4-bfa857abafbd-1
01:10:34.101 --> 01:10:35.930
enough where you can feel the vibrations.

56f29aa9-6347-4d5d-a948-c268eb4dcbb0-0
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:41.010
And The thing is this is for your in inner well-being.

176e686e-364a-4f86-809d-1e60e91f0581-0
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:42.370
So you should.

3936302b-c377-4089-9389-9871da249f33-0
01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:46.561
It will take some time maybe for your family to get used to the

3936302b-c377-4089-9389-9871da249f33-1
01:10:46.561 --> 01:10:48.290
to you making the arm chanting sound.

84342fec-8b88-445a-a40a-6aa1f6e74775-0
01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:52.325
But it should, it shouldn't prevent you from from doing

84342fec-8b88-445a-a40a-6aa1f6e74775-1
01:10:52.325 --> 01:10:52.650
this.

731d7fc8-b1a4-4a86-8a01-e91cfb4e0321-0
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:57.810
Yes this question is from Amit.

49d7844d-1208-408a-8f5f-4148468b0f23-0
01:10:58.690 --> 01:11:04.207
During cat stretch you mentioned that no need to stop the breath

49d7844d-1208-408a-8f5f-4148468b0f23-1
01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:05.650
during each step.

4469a14d-15bc-4dff-9515-bbe4bf02aa55-0
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.970
However, the breath automatically stop.

4cd00016-6ee7-4ab8-b881-3dbf87701e4a-0
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:11.450
How to ensure we keep breathing during each posture?

ce0031d1-f0cb-400e-b6d9-0e052eabeac4-0
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.473
So during Adi Bachchan, once you reach a certain posture, you

ce0031d1-f0cb-400e-b6d9-0e052eabeac4-1
01:11:18.473 --> 01:11:21.670
just continue to breathe deeper than normal.

0b6709e5-0479-48c3-90a6-5036648762d7-0
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.590
Yes?

bafb38dd-59b4-4d70-978c-bfdef4b228c1-0
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:25.897
So when you transition from 1
posture to the next posture is

bafb38dd-59b4-4d70-978c-bfdef4b228c1-1
01:11:25.897 --> 01:11:28.553
an alternate exhalation, inhalation, exhalation,

bafb38dd-59b4-4d70-978c-bfdef4b228c1-2
01:11:28.553 --> 01:11:29.149
inhalation.

3f7dd780-762d-4912-9276-34e81fb6f8ab-0
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:32.030
But once you reach the posture, you will.

4aab51fe-85d9-4bcd-80d8-95ccc82f49b2-0
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:35.880
You will hold the posture, but you will breathe slightly deeper

4aab51fe-85d9-4bcd-80d8-95ccc82f49b2-1
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.550
than normal.

68329041-6c67-4673-9de0-8048b5a3ca46-0
01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:40.452
So you can take a few breaths and then you can then continue

68329041-6c67-4673-9de0-8048b5a3ca46-1
01:11:40.452 --> 01:11:41.680
to the next posture.

fede180b-e4b6-4894-85ed-9da7665bf458-0
01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.040
Just make sure that you're holding the same.

e913c4db-ce71-4090-aa15-f0ef4618ccf8-0
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.800
You're holding the same amount of time.

c7cf4c48-172d-4fae-a5a6-c87c79ff4cb8-0
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.160
So let's say you hold for like 5
seconds in each posture.

e0c4d418-ad7b-4db6-9d4e-c06e4595b34d-0
01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.378
You will hold the same amount of time in each posture, but you

e0c4d418-ad7b-4db6-9d4e-c06e4595b34d-1
01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:56.600
never hold the breath.

bb72c1ad-ec3f-413b-a3cb-89d4a3557409-0
01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.333
Yes, So you always breathe slightly deeper than normal once

bb72c1ad-ec3f-413b-a3cb-89d4a3557409-1
01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:01.600
you reach the posture.

c17036e0-d1d1-4423-8e57-feea1e578faa-0
01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.600
This question is from Suta for Ether Sitasana.

6efc2fde-8faf-4ccf-8990-471128ed1f69-0
01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.230
It's almost impossible to place the left foot on Mura Tara

6efc2fde-8faf-4ccf-8990-471128ed1f69-1
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:14.480
without sitting on it.

8d32401b-706e-43fa-a125-c97251de83fe-0
01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.920
When I sit down, the Mura Tara is at the bottom.

0287b7ac-69e8-42fe-a2c1-247994c7632f-0
01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.160
I'm a female.

b16a1b67-53a2-4451-abd6-fb8e6f54cfe3-0
01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.920
Can you please clarify?

8b20f20f-bc38-410f-845c-b3464e26952a-0
01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.832
So if you if you are unable to touch the left heel to the

8b20f20f-bc38-410f-845c-b3464e26952a-1
01:12:29.832 --> 01:12:34.385
Muladhara, one simple thing is you can just sit on the edge of

8b20f20f-bc38-410f-845c-b3464e26952a-2
01:12:34.385 --> 01:12:38.000
the cushion and you see it can touch much easier.

940d9b86-963f-436e-9f0b-b0ae6b5d95c4-0
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.834
But if this is not possible, then you can just bring it as

940d9b86-963f-436e-9f0b-b0ae6b5d95c4-1
01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:45.388
close as possible, Yes, and the more you practice over time

940d9b86-963f-436e-9f0b-b0ae6b5d95c4-2
01:12:45.388 --> 01:12:47.580
you'll see it can touch much easier.

7c97d692-ec9b-43a0-b3f6-d89168e7d040-0
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.060
This question is from Shweta.

aab2174a-f86b-4c75-bde9-ffa29c22a8b2-0
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.504
Do we have to do all the exercises in the order

aab2174a-f86b-4c75-bde9-ffa29c22a8b2-1
01:12:56.504 --> 01:12:57.900
demonstrated today?

4532eecd-b2fe-4a88-9837-f1e7ad21769f-0
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:00.660
Yes.

60fbfcf4-b4e8-425e-9e6a-410dfa2789ea-0
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.819
So all of the practices, all the proprietary asanas has to be

60fbfcf4-b4e8-425e-9e6a-410dfa2789ea-1
01:13:03.819 --> 01:13:04.940
done in that sequence.

b16a0d10-e47c-4631-94cb-6b62d96a2b14-0
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:08.730
In terms of Shambhavi Mahamudra, we'll see.

323cb7fb-437f-4ccb-923b-d9cff43a63cc-0
01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:11.806
So we have been learning in bits and pieces the, the steps for

323cb7fb-437f-4ccb-923b-d9cff43a63cc-1
01:13:11.806 --> 01:13:13.010
Shambhavi Mahamudra today.

75605ee3-ff32-4e29-abe4-2fd80259e3ec-0
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.930
So we'll see how we're putting it together tomorrow, yes.

7b36c987-e9e7-42f2-a0b6-bc8c12de4b82-0
01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:20.977
But in terms of the perpetrator asanas that is a sequence

7b36c987-e9e7-42f2-a0b6-bc8c12de4b82-1
01:13:20.977 --> 01:13:24.626
Patangasana which is the butterfly and then the shishu

7b36c987-e9e7-42f2-a0b6-bc8c12de4b82-2
01:13:24.626 --> 01:13:28.010
palasana or rock the baby and then Nadi by chance.

2d2e7a92-636c-4267-a648-d0ffe62f0bb6-0
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:29.930
So it has to done to be done in that order.

1ca70a47-7a32-4f40-8c43-f22ae4acab18-0
01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:37.290
This question is from Ishwari.

2700611d-0700-4042-8877-c568c481bf19-0
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:41.250
I'm not able to contract anal muscle for long.

73a96fa7-7139-43f3-8155-be9de32008a0-0
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:45.530
I'm realizing I'm losing it in the middle way.

f78e18b7-2649-4da5-8835-656500657478-0
01:13:49.330 --> 01:13:53.344
So if you're not able to hold the analogue for long right now,

f78e18b7-2649-4da5-8835-656500657478-1
01:13:53.344 --> 01:13:56.530
it will take some time for the body to cooperate.

ff60feb0-0008-407d-a924-5e0fdd96a315-0
01:13:56.890 --> 01:14:01.464
So just you will see like as you continue to practice it will get

ff60feb0-0008-407d-a924-5e0fdd96a315-1
01:14:01.464 --> 01:14:01.950
better.

0e809714-5480-4591-80a7-24992a8e22cc-0
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:05.094
Yeah so but for now just make sure that you're clear about the

0e809714-5480-4591-80a7-24992a8e22cc-1
01:14:05.094 --> 01:14:05.710
instructions.

5ca1aa35-0779-4a36-9b30-cdbfb2569916-0
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:10.078
So if you're clear on how to do the bandas, it is OK because as

5ca1aa35-0779-4a36-9b30-cdbfb2569916-1
01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:14.312
long as you're aware of you know what is, what is wrong, what is

5ca1aa35-0779-4a36-9b30-cdbfb2569916-2
01:14:14.312 --> 01:14:18.416
still not right with your with your practice and then overtime

5ca1aa35-0779-4a36-9b30-cdbfb2569916-3
01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:22.390
you can fix it, yes and the body will cooperate to overtime.

ec1a6a8a-593b-4da7-9283-f44dc95faa90-0
01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:26.390
This question is from Yao.

79624274-1120-4956-b165-27517a092dee-0
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:32.630
Can we practice the bandas as many times as we can in a day?

01f15de4-7aad-49ca-9d53-a88ecc39209b-0
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:36.990
So the answer is no.

e373fe4e-89f3-4cc8-b066-1fe83ceef4ad-0
01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:40.470
The bandas can only be done as part of Shambhavi Mahamudra.

c6d03504-3bc1-43c7-975f-c110f5d40875-0
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:42.750
It can only be done once.

5cb2c5e1-858a-49f1-ad5f-6d9c902ed92b-0
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:46.470
Once on fullness of breath and once on emptiness of breath.

0c42cd0e-1cc2-48f7-bb80-feb21ac6c04d-0
01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:50.226
So it is very important that you don't repeatedly engage the

0c42cd0e-1cc2-48f7-bb80-feb21ac6c04d-1
01:14:50.226 --> 01:14:50.630
bandas.

8c226df3-4457-4cae-8bd0-2ec1620423fc-0
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.350
Yes.

03e3d7d8-5af8-4c49-9351-35acaf3b1ef5-0
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.160
So we are only out of time right now.

28b87c57-47f6-4bee-a946-808599d63f73-0
01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.920
So if there are more questions, we will look at it later.

b4a57721-8f04-4741-a9a7-814a2795d42a-0
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:11.649
After after the session, we'll stay back for another 10 to 15

b4a57721-8f04-4741-a9a7-814a2795d42a-1
01:15:11.649 --> 01:15:12.720
minutes if needed.

34255fc6-2aa1-48a9-9bfa-711b36d73e1b-0
01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:20.200
And so right now, what can Shami Muhammadra brings to your life?

34108a08-86dc-4a60-9965-85dd598e8069-0
01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.000
Let's hear from Sadhguru.

c06495c4-382a-4d1b-bd81-79ab11d57b71-0
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:27.500
You can sit in others dasana with your palms facing upwards.

d63da281-eea9-45d4-b47b-5213e4210dda-0
01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:33.779
Make sure your eyes are open making this whole effort of

d63da281-eea9-45d4-b47b-5213e4210dda-1
01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:37.020
learning this samavi mahamudra.

d3db55ce-ae9c-4945-be06-7eaa14a3cbaf-0
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:44.811
Naturally your mind will ask, Well this is OK but what will I

d3db55ce-ae9c-4945-be06-7eaa14a3cbaf-1
01:15:44.811 --> 01:15:45.180
get?

30c54455-e5cc-4aff-83f4-3bcdfa51ce80-0
01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:51.740
I told you not to think about what you will get the last day.

dd640121-1060-40fa-8676-a78d910a2974-0
01:15:56.070 --> 01:16:00.630
Let's look at the five main benefits that one can derive by

dd640121-1060-40fa-8676-a78d910a2974-1
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:02.150
practicing Shambabi.

f3ddda97-dd2a-49fa-8463-37221641417e-0
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:11.140
One thing is it can greatly enhance the rejuvenation process

f3ddda97-dd2a-49fa-8463-37221641417e-1
01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.910
in the system.

9604e797-eba4-4505-9894-56840a205014-0
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:18.645
Rejuvenation means every moment in your body old cells are dying

9604e797-eba4-4505-9894-56840a205014-1
01:16:18.645 --> 01:16:20.830
and new cells are being born.

247dad77-2617-4192-ac8a-e8a4412cf83e-0
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:23.250
This activity is happening all the time.

23cc07f6-1322-4da7-b971-5a9b31815991-0
01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:29.793
To what extent this is happening means approximately once in 2

23cc07f6-1322-4da7-b971-5a9b31815991-1
01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:34.330
1/2 years all the old cells die and new cells are born.

629f0d28-12ac-42c6-a4cb-4f768b1fcb21-0
01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:40.501
Or in other words, like for example let's say there are 100

629f0d28-12ac-42c6-a4cb-4f768b1fcb21-1
01:16:40.501 --> 01:16:42.810
billion cells in this body.

e26a2eae-0ba4-4c1c-9ce8-13b81b06b3e2-0
01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:49.116
In 2 1/2 years time, 100 billion cells die and 100 billion new

e26a2eae-0ba4-4c1c-9ce8-13b81b06b3e2-1
01:16:49.116 --> 01:16:50.170
cells are born.

a0bbc822-1419-4e11-a580-56d91456538e-0
01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:55.283
That means every 2 1/2 years, virtually you have a whole new

a0bbc822-1419-4e11-a580-56d91456538e-1
01:16:55.283 --> 01:16:55.620
body.

fb942ebc-d9f2-4907-a8f0-f17487091699-0
01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:02.872
So if this rejuvenation process is well taken care of, old age

fb942ebc-d9f2-4907-a8f0-f17487091699-1
01:17:02.872 --> 01:17:04.420
need not be misery.

f84a7579-0372-43a7-bac9-2e5913f206c4-0
01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:09.485
It can be one of the best parts of your life, because when

f84a7579-0372-43a7-bac9-2e5913f206c4-1
01:17:09.485 --> 01:17:12.500
you're a child, you're very eager to grow up.

b4ca7009-7685-48b3-a5ee-737fb1834849-0
01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.973
It's good, but it's not good enough because you want to grow

b4ca7009-7685-48b3-a5ee-737fb1834849-1
01:17:15.973 --> 01:17:16.140
up.

bbdc9968-ba05-48b1-bc97-9c6f538fadd6-0
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.020
You want to be like adults, Isn't it?

7d9a3aa2-87a5-4049-9bca-465f6d60fe94-0
01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:21.211
So, Sadhguru, now everybody talks about how wonderful

7d9a3aa2-87a5-4049-9bca-465f6d60fe94-1
01:17:21.211 --> 01:17:24.830
childhood was, but when you were a child, you didn't want it.

0ed6803f-74b6-4ad0-9569-c6ee37df3080-0
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:26.390
You wanted to grow up quick, isn't it?

60a0f376-64ff-4a4a-96da-b60e9b819c27-0
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:33.632
Once you came into youthfulness, youthfulness came with

60a0f376-64ff-4a4a-96da-b60e9b819c27-1
01:17:33.632 --> 01:17:37.590
tremendous sense of energy, power, intelligence.

27152a23-0376-4e60-9d14-0d25ad65571b-0
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:43.251
But your intelligence got hijacked by your hormones and

27152a23-0376-4e60-9d14-0d25ad65571b-1
01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:46.350
the whole world got twisted out.

e67a9de4-2172-4130-b7d6-ef6739859f0d-0
01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:55.770
Then that heat plays its own drama for some time.

870c5918-9f41-4931-bc1b-d503de54c4a4-0
01:17:56.930 --> 01:18:00.570
When all it comes, all the drama is over once again.

8e253e23-7992-4353-ab5f-9a7075904084-0
01:18:00.570 --> 01:18:04.402
You are like a child with the whole experience of life behind

8e253e23-7992-4353-ab5f-9a7075904084-1
01:18:04.402 --> 01:18:04.650
you.

a4cd28f9-f963-4a7f-b208-8b33d312c503-0
01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:08.925
If you have kept your rejuvenation process good within

a4cd28f9-f963-4a7f-b208-8b33d312c503-1
01:18:08.925 --> 01:18:11.210
you, now this can be a blessed time.

a1c3b4f5-f87b-4130-be1f-e808f5875461-0
01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:15.730
The experience of life behind you once again like a child.

d3f43311-752c-4626-8806-24f9468a6430-0
01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:20.250
No compulsions, no nothing driving you here and there.

24a57f3d-e4b2-4556-a8b4-a04e4085fc97-0
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.130
This can be the most wonderful part of your life.

f7427b35-5123-4c23-bc61-5ba79d7dc875-0
01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:26.922
If you have made your life experience into your wisdom

f7427b35-5123-4c23-bc61-5ba79d7dc875-1
01:18:26.922 --> 01:18:31.290
instead of a wound, you've made a wound out of your experience.

24b6e98c-779e-48ef-a2b2-1d007532f57e-0
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.090
That's different.

0f1e6961-a1e4-400a-878f-7a9da7e1ad5b-0
01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:36.743
If you made your life experience into a great sense of wisdom and

0f1e6961-a1e4-400a-878f-7a9da7e1ad5b-1
01:18:36.743 --> 01:18:40.700
stability within you, and if your body is good, then this can

0f1e6961-a1e4-400a-878f-7a9da7e1ad5b-2
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.850
be a blessed time.

d1294823-1171-48e3-8789-0c46f76016c6-0
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:48.350
In India, life was divided tradition into four parts.

b4659190-1cf8-4720-969d-900e3fce78f1-0
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:50.550
This is known as varnashanadharma.

ffbbc907-8c1f-4e84-a1f1-fb15e4e51af3-0
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:57.870
This is from zero to 12.

ac7c19e4-fb81-4733-b233-27588e68b4cd-0
01:18:58.030 --> 01:18:59.270
It's called Balavasta.

27821cd0-4482-4e54-92a5-2e4b666411a3-0
01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:00.430
It's childhood.

4e4998ce-ccbb-40b4-bb0a-f3eaba4d9271-0
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:03.150
Here you're just supposed to play.

0ee2cbc3-86c6-47c4-a419-a408c7b1b586-0
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:06.150
No ABC, NO123, no nothing.

4c83061e-9acb-4d61-8b0a-1993518ad3cd-0
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.790
Just play till 12 years of age.

3c917ec9-895d-4956-a9be-9478c3bd1e35-0
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:12.830
That would be a good way your children would appreciate it.

0a8fbbe3-497f-4fde-81e5-30ddf45ad34e-0
01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:18.290
12 to 24 is called Brahmacharya.

1ea0245d-2fe7-4b51-9a0a-94751294ea56-0
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:24.142
This is the face of discipline and learning, where the child

1ea0245d-2fe7-4b51-9a0a-94751294ea56-1
01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:27.450
leaves the family and goes and stays with.

44e61ba8-f041-4f18-889c-a88f9df56ca5-0
01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:32.768
The guru spends 12 years in great sense of discipline and a

44e61ba8-f041-4f18-889c-a88f9df56ca5-1
01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.250
certain process of learning.

56751e6b-970d-4251-b1dd-e8089aeafa4f-0
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:41.916
At the age of 24, you choose whether you want to go into

56751e6b-970d-4251-b1dd-e8089aeafa4f-1
01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:47.740
family kind of situation or you want to go into aesthetic life.

3d224c3b-a684-43d0-a9d0-422ac942c503-0
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.316
Generally in ancient times, 30%
of the people chose aesthetic

3d224c3b-a684-43d0-a9d0-422ac942c503-1
01:19:53.316 --> 01:19:55.900
life, 70% chose family situations.

33666b4e-b733-461c-8bbb-40f379135a5a-0
01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.940
This would be a good balance.

d1a8d933-5504-465a-9fcd-0f89a215a16c-0
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.732
Right now everybody is getting into something because everybody

d1a8d933-5504-465a-9fcd-0f89a215a16c-1
01:20:02.732 --> 01:20:04.220
else is getting into something.

73780501-e1b8-4111-bf5f-2c77b7329bcb-0
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.827
People are not looking and considering what they really

73780501-e1b8-4111-bf5f-2c77b7329bcb-1
01:20:06.827 --> 01:20:07.060
want.

8a7ae9f0-2e4a-4473-8d79-cba6111e05a0-0
01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.780
They are being driven by the social norms.

ccadea4a-d13e-4e97-8ade-5dcfb7a25533-0
01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.340
So when they spend these 12
years?

e5ca82d8-cc45-4efa-9c85-58d4c1292934-0
01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.323
In education, they got the necessary balance to look at

e5ca82d8-cc45-4efa-9c85-58d4c1292934-1
01:20:17.323 --> 01:20:21.161
their lives and see within themselves what they need to do

e5ca82d8-cc45-4efa-9c85-58d4c1292934-2
01:20:21.161 --> 01:20:24.480
for themselves, not because of social compulsions.

6a0fa34c-edde-4518-ad9f-392a1340fe93-0
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.040
So those who went an aesthetic path, their life is different.

047e3307-b5e6-449d-92f2-78e4c60687e8-0
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:35.064
Those who went in family situations from 24 to 48, those

047e3307-b5e6-449d-92f2-78e4c60687e8-1
01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:38.880
24 years span is considered family life.

b2dced11-fccd-4f91-aada-fffe15ab37d7-0
01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:44.764
By the time you're 48, if you got married at 24, your children

b2dced11-fccd-4f91-aada-fffe15ab37d7-1
01:20:44.764 --> 01:20:47.530
are all in the range of 18 to

dce20b45-d436-4b96-8374-8e792b989cbb-0
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.850
They are wishing that you're gone.

bab21352-043b-484c-93c4-2cbb72aea2c2-0
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:52.250
You're in the way.

a6429232-2ea7-4dab-b7bb-1c1d38629912-0
01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:55.250
You're in the way, isn't it?

51650db2-5916-4049-9063-a63268e9d6db-0
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.890
Whether you like it or not, you're in the way.

2e95ee49-e95a-4742-818f-be7e9d277aa4-0
01:20:56.890 --> 01:20:58.250
Either they must go or you must go.

e031d9ae-2ced-4c14-af27-1ab52f2e1788-0
01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:01.490
These days you're choosing, they go.

3f62e2ee-6f1e-41c0-9eb2-62566fcaeaa3-0
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:09.080
But those days they decided once you're 48 and children are

3f62e2ee-6f1e-41c0-9eb2-62566fcaeaa3-1
01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:16.653
coming to a certain thing, then parents start saying how to move

3f62e2ee-6f1e-41c0-9eb2-62566fcaeaa3-2
01:21:16.653 --> 01:21:17.120
out.

b0084b95-9ccb-42bb-b508-04611b42e0f7-0
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.883
And these 12 years, 48 to 60 is known as sanyasa, where

b0084b95-9ccb-42bb-b508-04611b42e0f7-1
01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:29.600
everybody goes into an ascetic life for 12 years.

27494bbd-08fb-4c6f-b032-39e0c5a8664b-0
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.125
From 48 to 60 years, husband and wife will go separately to

27494bbd-08fb-4c6f-b032-39e0c5a8664b-1
01:21:34.125 --> 01:21:38.264
different schools where they live separately for 12 years and

27494bbd-08fb-4c6f-b032-39e0c5a8664b-2
01:21:38.264 --> 01:21:40.000
go on a spiritual sadhana.

efbcdf61-28a8-429a-8a91-99345659b7b4-0
01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:44.830
After 12 years when they have attained to a certain level of

efbcdf61-28a8-429a-8a91-99345659b7b4-1
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:48.187
inner well-being, at 60 they come together once again and

efbcdf61-28a8-429a-8a91-99345659b7b4-2
01:21:48.187 --> 01:21:48.940
they remarry.

a851681e-d4a3-4e85-bde3-e13700ab3413-0
01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.940
Even today the Indians get married at 60.

a24d5730-7811-4e29-a22f-771ea2f70930-0
01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.460
Hmm but without going separate.

41362319-cf74-4cc8-90c2-7174b1797439-0
01:21:54.500 --> 01:22:00.770
But you must go away for 12
years and then get married first

41362319-cf74-4cc8-90c2-7174b1797439-1
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:04.780
time when you married it was the body.

1063021c-9bd8-40a4-baaf-5239a19047ad-0
01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.740
Mainly body compulsions.

1b764a50-31dd-403c-b936-9c9acf045eac-0
01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:09.700
Physical compulsions pushed you in the direction Sadhguru.

16651f5b-3fb6-4858-986a-99f2425a8fd1-0
01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.820
Now you're getting married in a completely different way.

33009b9d-fc54-4c80-94a4-a2fbb26cc084-0
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.195
2 human 2 beings are coming together not for the body sake

33009b9d-fc54-4c80-94a4-a2fbb26cc084-1
01:22:16.195 --> 01:22:18.420
in a completely different way.

6f360b38-367a-440e-8af6-f22038d10f6e-0
01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:22.420
12 years of sadhana, 12 years of inner development has happened.

28b212dd-c579-43af-8e1a-0606faaf2638-0
01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:25.692
Now they come together in a completely different way and now

28b212dd-c579-43af-8e1a-0606faaf2638-1
01:22:25.692 --> 01:22:26.980
they go for vanaprastha.

4c84fc0a-8ea9-49a7-bb4d-f49441f9fc5f-0
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.580
Vanaprastha means a life in the forest.

d67888b0-b959-4f99-a541-6df172727a5a-0
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:35.044
They withdraw from the city and the normal hustle and bustle and

d67888b0-b959-4f99-a541-6df172727a5a-1
01:22:35.044 --> 01:22:37.340
go into the forest and live there.

57249ccc-ecec-4501-9354-7c5841c0bb27-0
01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:41.668
We are trying to provide this both in India and also here in

57249ccc-ecec-4501-9354-7c5841c0bb27-1
01:22:41.668 --> 01:22:42.170
Tennessee.

38dbccb2-e0bf-42b4-90e7-07cde73866a3-0
01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:45.681
Now, for people who reach a certain stage in their life,

38dbccb2-e0bf-42b4-90e7-07cde73866a3-1
01:22:45.681 --> 01:22:49.009
they must remove themselves before people are wishing

38dbccb2-e0bf-42b4-90e7-07cde73866a3-2
01:22:49.009 --> 01:22:49.810
they're gone.

c229e76e-07c9-41d9-9e04-9bc7c1490ece-0
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:55.926
By the time your children are
1820, either they must move or

c229e76e-07c9-41d9-9e04-9bc7c1490ece-1
01:22:55.926 --> 01:22:56.770
you must move.

d22d3972-64f8-4311-8d9e-3eb701e2298a-0
01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:58.490
Such situations are coming, isn't it?

c0833c0c-9e8c-4eb6-a1f4-e9fb8d5c8af7-0
01:22:59.050 --> 01:23:05.490
Yes, because they're in a different phase of life.

a072aa3e-a3bc-4e61-9d2e-a8dbd3e0770f-0
01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:06.930
You're in a different phase of life.

6fe6a5f6-cc8f-4aca-9f3c-c077a3fbf440-0
01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:07.570
It doesn't.

90b92a4f-3ea9-436e-9610-9ccbefac684a-0
01:23:09.690 --> 01:23:11.650
It's not because you are wrong or they are wrong.

d4dbef86-2704-41f4-a9e8-b4fac400cb25-0
01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:12.810
It just doesn't work.

a4722afd-ac03-4f21-aff5-04bdcfc97507-0
01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:19.820
So Vanaprastha Ashram means going to the forest and living

a4722afd-ac03-4f21-aff5-04bdcfc97507-1
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:20.930
at the age of 60.

aa7303a5-43af-4ad7-ba87-07222270dd41-0
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:23.690
If you have to move into the forest, you must be fit.

8969d879-97b8-4dfb-96df-ec343a3c0402-0
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:27.290
Otherwise you can't do that right now.

26dc55e6-ce5d-43ff-ad84-236cc5584e6f-0
01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.690
Old age means it's become doctor hospital.

c3d5a3ff-7033-45e9-bde0-e3943b1529c6-0
01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:31.210
Hospital.

29ea7aae-e0e2-42ec-93e3-8ddcfba6da25-0
01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:32.490
Doctor Hospital.

87ed6122-b54f-4e05-ac09-5839399bb7dd-0
01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:36.450
Ashrama Vanaprastha Ashramma is over in the world.

0699927a-3016-4313-8b11-8e6faf265325-0
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:41.156
If one takes care of the rejuvenation process, old age

0699927a-3016-4313-8b11-8e6faf265325-1
01:23:41.156 --> 01:23:42.350
need not be a misery.

a2d17acc-9cdf-406f-a52a-6266e8f9a17d-0
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:44.190
Old age can be a blessed state.

86f3e7cd-213d-4c15-bada-eef165d402b2-0
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:48.590
So Sambhavi definitely does that to you.

91bd660c-d2bd-445f-b504-b6957ad45278-0
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:52.305
You can see that six months of Sambhavi, you should feel at

91bd660c-d2bd-445f-b504-b6957ad45278-1
01:23:52.305 --> 01:23:55.030
least five years younger than what you are.

11a2099f-3cf5-480d-806d-3cdc2fea1cf9-0
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:56.470
Yes.

01:23:57.710 --> 01:23:58.550
Don't tell me your age.

442672fa-3b30-4d5d-a6bd-fd74c30b0cdf-0
01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:05.950
OK, I will tell you in how many days you'll be 18.

931fc1ed-1b02-404e-b12f-1bb0dc31bf52-0
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.100
The second benefit is it can enhance your lifespan.

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:23.513
If you look at the animal Kingdom, you can clearly see

f11916ee-a14c-4c2c-89c3-87eef6e44c36-1
01:24:23.513 --> 01:24:23.980
this.

61bfd89c-4f17-4b92-9bc6-6e106dede655-0
01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:28.242
How long an animal lives, its lifespan and the number of

61bfd89c-4f17-4b92-9bc6-6e106dede655-1
01:24:28.242 --> 01:24:31.820
breaths that it takes per minute is very directly connected.

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.568
For example, a dog's, a dog breeds about 70 to 72 times per

d933515a-5a9b-4b3b-a549-a181dc0284cb-1
01:24:37.568 --> 01:24:38.090
minute.

Its lifespan is between 12 to 14
years.

01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:47.130
A horse breeds for about 25 to
30 times per minute.

01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:51.130
Its lifespan is also in the range of 25 to 30 years.

0d1bcbdd-3491-4280-98a8-820cf3ebced5-0
01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:57.330
An elephant breeds for about 15
to 18 times per minute.

Its lifespan is between 80 to
100 years.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:05.909
Human beings breathe about 12 to
15 times per minute, and in

bb731f36-7506-46d6-bcd6-b4c6b7451b70-1
01:25:05.909 --> 01:25:09.130
ideal conditions you can live up to 160 years.

01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:15.124
Certain turtles breathe about 5
to 8 times per minute, and they

d38b91f1-a2e8-4937-a35f-b52e84a49287-1
01:25:15.124 --> 01:25:16.370
live up to 500 years.

f43a7e3a-65e2-4ae8-a4f5-2ea364de17aa-0
01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:18.490
Even today, you know the gallopagus.

218fea73-e6cf-4f8e-94e8-7de8adceb1f4-0
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:25.336
Certain sea snakes breathe about two to three times per minute,

218fea73-e6cf-4f8e-94e8-7de8adceb1f4-1
01:25:25.336 --> 01:25:27.490
and they live up to 1000 years.

a62e3664-4ef0-4ae2-a00e-8fc1bc5af743-0
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:29.410
Even today you can find them in the oceans.

c64787e9-547f-40e5-82b8-ee7dbacd4a9b-0
01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:33.374
This shows that the number of breaths that you take for a

c64787e9-547f-40e5-82b8-ee7dbacd4a9b-1
01:25:33.374 --> 01:25:36.210
minute and how long you live is very directly connected.

01:25:36.690 --> 01:25:41.879
The same science has been expressed in a different way in

d3ca4777-201b-4176-a141-4085b723b584-1
01:25:41.879 --> 01:25:43.490
yoga and Ayurveda.

c5f3c4ac-5940-44f2-8f9c-c5b53cada2e7-0
01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:47.457
What we say is God gives everybody the same number of

c5f3c4ac-5940-44f2-8f9c-c5b53cada2e7-1
01:25:47.457 --> 01:25:48.010
breaths.

01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:50.410
If you breathe fast, you will go fast.

01:25:50.690 --> 01:25:52.410
If you breathe slow, you will go slow.

acac6c11-71e9-4ca6-bcd2-92206589e76d-0
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:56.890
You will see this you today.

c59e236c-b2ad-441a-bc9d-3536222a356a-0
01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:01.538
You check your pulse before dinner or before eating in the

c59e236c-b2ad-441a-bc9d-3536222a356a-1
01:26:01.538 --> 01:26:05.439
morning, before breakfast, and after breakfast six months

c59e236c-b2ad-441a-bc9d-3536222a356a-2
01:26:05.439 --> 01:26:09.676
later, you check your pulse rate and see it'll be considerably

c59e236c-b2ad-441a-bc9d-3536222a356a-3
01:26:09.676 --> 01:26:10.080
lower.

fdec774e-1e7b-4e60-9727-de0aa6fd7306-0
01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.459
The whole system will be going much more efficiently and much

fdec774e-1e7b-4e60-9727-de0aa6fd7306-1
01:26:14.459 --> 01:26:18.320
more smoothly at an easier pace, which means it'll last longer.

15b43dfd-af6d-4c86-a031-ec9305194793-0
01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.520
If you drive your engine at a lower RPM, it'll last longer.

d764fea9-4978-4f2f-942b-62ac7f18575f-0
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.046
Isn't it just like that the whole system is going at a lower

d764fea9-4978-4f2f-942b-62ac7f18575f-1
01:26:27.046 --> 01:26:27.640
RPM now.

bf78bfa7-7b8d-48fa-8edf-1360b0e7614a-0
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.050
It definitely lasts longer, Sadhguru.

2db6b4d2-f97a-4eba-8c98-cfb1959b3f3b-0
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:31.650
Stress is not there in the system.

3e3c6464-9ad8-4a3f-8f48-d3838d2cad1a-0
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:33.930
There's no such thing as stress in the system.

8c57762f-ece2-4e12-981e-203dd3103eae-0
01:26:34.210 --> 01:26:37.851
If you keep the whole system going at a certain pace right

8c57762f-ece2-4e12-981e-203dd3103eae-1
01:26:37.851 --> 01:26:41.679
now, without knowing, you know you don't know the distinction

8c57762f-ece2-4e12-981e-203dd3103eae-2
01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:44.210
between the floorboard and the throttle.

986b9a3f-4ba8-488d-bd9c-e7388a560f8c-0
01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:48.214
Anytime you press the throttle, all the time you press the

986b9a3f-4ba8-488d-bd9c-e7388a560f8c-1
01:26:48.214 --> 01:26:50.610
throttle, wing wing engine is revving up.

e3912500-ea7a-4a25-97ea-35a4b3077dae-0
01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:54.356
If you keep on revving the engine, you kill it soon, isn't

e3912500-ea7a-4a25-97ea-35a4b3077dae-1
01:26:54.356 --> 01:26:54.490
it?

ad6a83a6-1d62-430f-a9a7-2093fb97aac7-0
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.130
That's all that's happening to the system too.

2e45a740-dd2f-40a7-9f06-211cc17d9eb2-0
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.420
So 160 years are possible.

d506a96b-ec1e-491f-991d-2ca44d2bb79c-0
01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:01.860
Is that OK?

83dd40e6-c4e0-4215-b0d1-6245ccfb66cd-0
01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.700
No, no.

a41e33cf-84b2-4ec3-ba10-f7ac94240f9b-0
01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:06.780
How many?

4652688e-8e65-4382-90aa-e4ca7978916c-0
01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:17.100
If you don't want, oh, miserable people, Who doesn't want life?

97487540-a3b9-4f0f-a357-b5708381365e-0
01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.420
Somewhere the experience of life is burdensome.

2517ee75-f33c-4103-b3e2-3f978cddc647-0
01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.260
Now you're thinking, oh, sixty years of misery is enough.

a41312f2-41da-4c34-bc07-e978e2333b3f-0
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.260
Why extend it by another 100
years?

0786c505-ba48-496c-99f3-8a469e916852-0
01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:32.380
I once agree with the logic 60
years of misery.

19553e77-148c-43dc-81f1-459a785a0a20-0
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.100
Why extend it by 100 years?

36b0cd50-615b-4a0c-8e46-a310dc6b6c55-0
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.700
Definitely there's no need to extend.

a0d31324-bdbb-48a3-ac7d-9c51cf497736-0
01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.260
But why extend it up to 60
years?

bee35d47-a01c-4304-ad0d-dc712d62502d-0
01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:41.460
Isn't it?

069e90ac-2cdc-472e-a73a-c3cf8c3ee35e-0
01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:49.568
If the process of life, the experience of life, is painful

069e90ac-2cdc-472e-a73a-c3cf8c3ee35e-1
01:27:49.568 --> 01:27:52.340
and burdensome, why stretch it up to 60?

21636284-bfe0-42d8-8994-67dd1ba03f33-0
01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:57.750
Now you need to understand this time is a very relative

21636284-bfe0-42d8-8994-67dd1ba03f33-1
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:58.680
experience.

d1a0454d-1e31-4924-99ef-1a95e0b821e3-0
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.480
On a certain day you're very happy.

b6d5c0d0-3dd5-4e6b-9e4f-def47937243b-0
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.600
24 hours gone like a moment, isn't it?

b9e4ae4c-961f-479c-bab4-4650e2efbdba-0
01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:08.800
Yes.

4082e9e6-49b4-46ba-bd23-a65f1eb989ab-0
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.480
Have you noticed this?

fb46026f-01f1-4f1e-8a45-2c5007da32db-0
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.000
On a certain day you're very happy.

2cb1efed-d96a-4a1e-8aa5-0d0ffd4c66f6-0
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.840
24 hours just slips off like a minute.

215197c1-603d-4565-9b00-3d3f4f3d53e2-0
01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.520
Today you're very unhappy.

4462fba0-3809-4a6c-9490-fdb994d8f58a-0
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.520
An hour passes like a year.

15ba8229-4081-4948-8132-40b5c29a2a14-0
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.480
Isn't it so, Sadhguru?

4f1d75c5-d989-4035-b8c9-eca039e06777-0
01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.080
Time is a very relative experience.

789cc0cc-871f-43ac-9a75-5442155085cd-0
01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.626
If you're a joyful person, 160
years before you look around,

789cc0cc-871f-43ac-9a75-5442155085cd-1
01:28:29.626 --> 01:28:30.440
it'll be over.

548c8b7a-3405-4d8e-a875-59efd4fdc3ae-0
01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.362
Yes, for what potential a human being carries, 160 years is

548c8b7a-3405-4d8e-a875-59efd4fdc3ae-1
01:28:35.362 --> 01:28:35.880
nothing.

10605095-6322-40db-971b-0ee76877890d-0
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.280
Before you look around what's happening, it'll be gone.

83bec469-e4ab-4868-8b1b-52aa69116380-0
01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.720
But if you're miserable, it's too long.

edbe793d-dbeb-46ea-a816-c9b19d2c8d46-0
01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.920
It's too long.

6800ad4b-ec52-49f4-8234-5a04d50698ce-0
01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.720
So the choice is right there, this moment.

e566eef2-755e-4525-9599-7bcf1e280ecd-0
01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:55.210
If you choose to be joyful, can you be joyful?

6354a539-0588-45ec-96f4-eb0498fbcc06-0
01:28:56.170 --> 01:28:56.690
This moment?

b62f1c28-aa3e-485c-8448-46df21ffd27b-0
01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:56.930
Hmm.

c01a56bc-ec1f-426f-b59a-c5a1ca977e6c-0
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:59.930
If you choose to be joyful, can you be?

af2d4a34-690b-4a11-874f-a3e2659c1efb-0
01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:04.351
It doesn't matter what the hell is happening in the world right

af2d4a34-690b-4a11-874f-a3e2659c1efb-1
01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:05.450
now at this moment.

b24d6c5c-8aa7-46e3-a28d-8f6859415577-0
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:07.530
If you choose to be joyful, can you be joyful?

abb49ace-9a06-4f67-88a7-b52f363e28b0-0
01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:10.410
So many things are not happening the way you want it.

2dbce153-08e7-4188-b7d6-844a1805bb61-0
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:11.410
It doesn't matter.

f7d710a2-a51b-4829-8257-5300fcc18634-0
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:12.210
Can you be joyful?

b24a40c8-dd65-481f-9d14-a476c779506b-0
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:14.610
If you want to, you can be so.

b4f53dfc-a43c-4af8-bf0b-bda9c3c191fd-0
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:17.884
If you can create one moment the way you want it, can you create

b4f53dfc-a43c-4af8-bf0b-bda9c3c191fd-1
01:29:17.884 --> 01:29:18.690
one more moment?

9cb4b97f-ef93-49d1-b817-cdc1934e23d0-0
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:20.730
Can You?

10085763-4ecb-4e3c-98cf-873b2dcb6e36-0
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:22.290
Can't.

1ec7d958-c549-4be7-8533-ed92129854fd-0
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:25.290
Can't you create one more moment the way you want it?

e05a0b60-1feb-4ff1-8fd4-a2cd96be0b6d-0
01:29:26.490 --> 01:29:28.010
Yes, One more.

777ec309-5a4d-4733-9f19-50907de8f6d1-0
01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:29.250
One more.

663a4a7d-a2d2-4952-935b-877f0a9d2371-0
01:29:30.010 --> 01:29:31.290
That's how life is created.

31c66493-ba11-4006-a62e-3b95760dee9d-0
01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:34.892
Fortunately, moments don't come at you in bunches, only one at a

31c66493-ba11-4006-a62e-3b95760dee9d-1
01:29:34.892 --> 01:29:35.170
time.

a7133eb2-4649-48f5-84ec-8263e9a5bfa9-0
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:37.570
So it's simple, isn't it?

4fbcb0ee-78be-4020-bc4a-fc76c61f8402-0
01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:41.528
If they were coming in bunches, they would have bewildered you,

4fbcb0ee-78be-4020-bc4a-fc76c61f8402-1
01:29:41.528 --> 01:29:42.490
just one at a time.

e19acae6-63cf-4d8f-8094-933835592052-0
01:29:43.810 --> 01:29:47.049
If you just know how to make this moment joyful, you know how

e19acae6-63cf-4d8f-8094-933835592052-1
01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:48.930
to make your life joyful, isn't it?

12f62066-413e-40a7-aaed-58bceda661d0-0
01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:50.370
If it's joyful.

d5d80403-6148-440d-97b7-77526738b0af-0
01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:53.054
If it's really joyful, whether you live for thousand years or

d5d80403-6148-440d-97b7-77526738b0af-1
01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:55.090
you die tomorrow morning, what does it matter?

291c07e6-e2f6-4c30-9422-b599184b58f9-0
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:57.370
What does it matter really?

fed31a96-1343-42d4-9613-8e6e73e36859-0
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:58.810
For a joyful person?

92d4bf43-06a9-4b31-b90d-71b4aae56815-0
01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:00.650
It doesn't matter now.

b2785111-df8b-417c-9b4e-27be4275654f-0
01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:02.130
For a miserable person.

a1b7574c-d222-4cd7-9d78-a518708dbd96-0
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:02.890
This is the person.

525f2c9a-f928-4ed6-bd0f-3c55092f2daf-0
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.330
If I tell you 160 years, you say no, no, no.

cfabb7f4-451d-4941-aae7-0b9d8e3126e8-0
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:07.890
OK Shall I arrange it for you tomorrow morning?

706f44bd-3c83-452d-80f5-255874ecb456-0
01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:09.330
No, no, no.

011b2f42-6dc4-42ad-adea-f14df99ec6de-0
01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:12.570
So not willing to live, not willing to die.

11e4290a-6d62-4d2c-b709-6bf64da0d019-0
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:14.130
This is a serious problem.

f5fbf8d2-3547-44e0-a178-d55d8afe78a0-0
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.620
If you're willing to live, it's wonderful.

7a10e9bd-053c-40bc-932b-c2307861e4a0-0
01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.580
You want to die.

8e6a99f4-1725-4d69-a091-7767d027e20e-0
01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.260
It's up to you.

ef9c2cfe-c5f1-40a5-98bb-94c5056e70a0-0
01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:25.420
But you're not willing to live, Not willing to die.

7667d042-39b2-4a26-848f-220575fb9b7f-0
01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:29.260
This is a burden, you know, upon you and upon everybody.

d7291c2f-6f7a-4757-88ae-fc7820928e6c-0
01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:34.100
Now you heard of Laatsu.

ec17a97e-b7df-4945-b4fe-f8858cca8a4c-0
01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.060
Laatsu.

8b1eec51-88b3-48f0-8d6d-c09a100f7118-0
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.874
Laatsu was one of the most beautiful human beings that

8b1eec51-88b3-48f0-8d6d-c09a100f7118-1
01:30:39.874 --> 01:30:40.860
walked this planet.

42f27f5a-7194-4b23-89db-52b8332aa83e-0
01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:46.713
One of the most gentlest and wonderful human being that

42f27f5a-7194-4b23-89db-52b8332aa83e-1
01:30:46.713 --> 01:30:47.940
walked this planet.

f6457da5-f55c-4c74-85a3-3fcc9d1b4133-0
01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.940
He was 84 years of age on his deathbed.

970aa459-3e02-4f6a-b68e-ff9d5f9f167e-0
01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.700
This is part of the Eastern traditions.

dc6e3ee6-fa1f-4a72-90d4-7e541b910314-0
01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:58.593
When the masters dying, disciples will gather for a last

dc6e3ee6-fa1f-4a72-90d4-7e541b910314-1
01:30:58.593 --> 01:30:59.140
message.

0e78acdf-d4fd-4297-9943-453f2a7d8bb2-0
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:07.590
Because when he's alive, they don't listen, you know, haven't

0e78acdf-d4fd-4297-9943-453f2a7d8bb2-1
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:08.100
you?

50962c4c-a502-434d-9519-6b462a0bcc81-0
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:08.500
Right.

7a0c59dd-4a2f-46b4-a60c-b2c3d56d2059-0
01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:16.904
So because they didn't listen to him when he was on, when is in

7a0c59dd-4a2f-46b4-a60c-b2c3d56d2059-1
01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:20.320
the deathbed, they want to really hear what he says.

0c702c7b-da84-4edd-be76-3b27bc51eb54-0
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:25.982
So they asked Lautsu, Master, you have faced all kinds of

0c702c7b-da84-4edd-be76-3b27bc51eb54-1
01:31:25.982 --> 01:31:29.960
extreme situations in your life, but you were always joyful.

af55cd00-17ae-448c-b5fe-6c25ce6b635d-0
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.600
What is the secret of your joy?

806808e3-4d46-4d78-9ddd-6fbae801b917-0
01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:34.760
Lautsu said.

a892abb4-77f9-42fa-b714-1979053d4dee-0
01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:36.480
Oh, that that no secret.

cff2a045-d66c-442d-abd1-4285d49ba2d5-0
01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.710
It is just that every day when I wake up in the morning, I had

cff2a045-d66c-442d-abd1-4285d49ba2d5-1
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:42.120
this question in my mind.

c364374c-36b1-443a-af9f-a1c10da3f358-0
01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.240
Today shall I be joyful or miserable?

580a2dcd-b8a8-44c1-9d75-f06d9aa2a5b5-0
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.360
Till now I just happen to choose joy, that's all.

1f7ff1a3-9807-4810-b851-6e1bd6516b4f-0
01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.240
And that's all it is.

671b4a6c-4215-493e-a99b-87877a8e2170-0
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.478
Because if you are willing, you can choose to be joyful right

671b4a6c-4215-493e-a99b-87877a8e2170-1
01:31:54.478 --> 01:31:54.680
now.

846a02ee-3649-4907-bcd2-8379d100a6d2-0
01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:55.120
Isn't it?

d244ea38-874f-4bdb-8b3a-7085da1ece74-0
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:59.680
So yes, it is just that you think by choosing misery you

d244ea38-874f-4bdb-8b3a-7085da1ece74-1
01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.200
will get something.

4daf4d56-729b-407f-a9ba-55a71dfc3813-0
01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.035
But if you're miserable, whatever you get, what does it

4daf4d56-729b-407f-a9ba-55a71dfc3813-1
01:32:05.035 --> 01:32:05.320
matter?

2b673d28-2962-4152-b189-fb8462922a1b-0
01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.239
And if you're joyful, whatever you don't get, who the hell

2b673d28-2962-4152-b189-fb8462922a1b-1
01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:11.520
cares?

19d767e6-c271-415c-91f8-b2858e0050ac-0
01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.920
Isn't it so 160 years are possible.

9abb5b68-2995-45f6-913f-653a03899670-0
01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.347
The problem with Shambhavi, Mohammadra, is if you're joyful,

9abb5b68-2995-45f6-913f-653a03899670-1
01:32:21.347 --> 01:32:22.800
it'll extend your joy.

8e507cfb-ff45-4379-8baf-6f5fdbf074e2-0
01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.600
If you're miserable, it'll extend your misery.

9c929496-9b5f-40df-9227-552284286984-0
01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.120
It also makes you joyful.

e9bb8013-bd26-4a6e-9f64-bab390ac7ece-0
01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.880
Does it leave you well?

474a595e-aa31-4c81-8115-d31b9797666b-0
01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:35.280
Is the Is the Mohammadra leaving you well?

a102f207-d5a5-42de-8c9b-7caa36ac8d92-0
01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:36.440
Hmm.

af5f52e4-0d76-4865-ad5a-0b118da5056b-0
01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.880
After the after the practice, Are you feeling well?

9be859c1-a1a0-459a-8d18-23f70cf5ae24-0
01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:44.508
So it could become very blissful, ecstatic that your

9be859c1-a1a0-459a-8d18-23f70cf5ae24-1
01:32:44.508 --> 01:32:45.930
life revolves around it.

f7b8794d-8067-4e54-8623-0857b125b4b3-0
01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:49.970
It can become like that but there are other benefits.

41bce748-c019-4b6f-ad31-42afe8c8b431-0
01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:51.770
It'll at least extend your life.

89671211-a08d-43f5-a477-8140112e3654-0
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:59.874
The next aspect of the practice is by doing the Kriya or the

89671211-a08d-43f5-a477-8140112e3654-1
01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:05.368
Mahamutra, you can greatly enhance the coordination between

89671211-a08d-43f5-a477-8140112e3654-2
01:33:05.368 --> 01:33:06.650
body and mind.

899ed0e1-c6e0-48f2-872f-e84bbaa71609-0
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:11.830
Mind body coordination means see, if I have to move my hand

899ed0e1-c6e0-48f2-872f-e84bbaa71609-1
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:15.980
like this, first my mind has to stress this path.

8213ee18-909d-4d14-948f-78bb9290c247-0
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.420
Only then my body can move like this.

95f33b44-971c-4bb2-9569-cb6953e962a0-0
01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:24.962
If this coordination is good, my hand will go exactly where I

95f33b44-971c-4bb2-9569-cb6953e962a0-1
01:33:24.962 --> 01:33:26.060
want it to go.

06e9e807-e8cb-4d38-b7f7-96b8be00d016-0
01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:29.178
If I want to touch this microphone where I'm looking or

06e9e807-e8cb-4d38-b7f7-96b8be00d016-1
01:33:29.178 --> 01:33:32.140
not looking, it goes only there if the coordination is good.

7518f2b5-5283-4c7c-84c3-b3b2dbbf5059-0
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.740
If it's not good, it goes slightly off.

28df2a70-e9c0-4f6d-b9bd-d0b9c66cf08b-0
01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:39.281
I have to make that little adjustment in every single

28df2a70-e9c0-4f6d-b9bd-d0b9c66cf08b-1
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:39.870
moment.

cafb0720-3856-447d-948d-4e4ab3f33d39-0
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:43.024
When you have to make that little adjustment, physical

cafb0720-3856-447d-948d-4e4ab3f33d39-1
01:33:43.024 --> 01:33:44.630
activity becomes burdensome.

cd03645b-4486-4d1a-bd9f-6f0b0f6bb048-0
01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:48.153
You cannot enjoy physical activity if your mind body

cd03645b-4486-4d1a-bd9f-6f0b0f6bb048-1
01:33:48.153 --> 01:33:49.550
coordination is good.

aa74d995-d4f9-47e3-9d15-019ab7d97887-0
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:52.972
You want to do things with your body because you enjoy the

aa74d995-d4f9-47e3-9d15-019ab7d97887-1
01:33:52.972 --> 01:33:53.630
moment of it.

a2bc54cd-cc2c-4c3b-83ad-543ba975d297-0
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:57.243
When the coordination is not good, you will try to avoid

a2bc54cd-cc2c-4c3b-83ad-543ba975d297-1
01:33:57.243 --> 01:33:59.470
everything because it is not enjoyable.

c947bac4-359b-43e6-9bbc-3a4d7c82c8b6-0
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:02.750
You will notice this just within a week of practice.

7c6e9046-060d-4597-a549-61a1f22b9a79-0
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:06.447
Simple things like you're driving, you're cooking, or

7c6e9046-060d-4597-a549-61a1f22b9a79-1
01:34:06.447 --> 01:34:07.030
whatever.

ad8f13e0-f63f-4028-9422-d0792bb6db36-0
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:10.394
Little things that you're doing with your life suddenly seems to

ad8f13e0-f63f-4028-9422-d0792bb6db36-1
01:34:10.394 --> 01:34:13.190
be more fun just because your coordination is better.

7723fa61-f661-4ed1-84c9-91cc01a9c1b6-0
01:34:13.710 --> 01:34:18.643
It could be already so, but within a week's time, everybody

7723fa61-f661-4ed1-84c9-91cc01a9c1b6-1
01:34:18.643 --> 01:34:23.741
can notice a distinct change in the way your body moves right

7723fa61-f661-4ed1-84c9-91cc01a9c1b6-2
01:34:23.741 --> 01:34:24.070
now.

c42f0f9e-6f10-4631-ab9a-7ae9b9faf6ca-0
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:26.590
I see If I ask you to get up, most of you will lose.

952d7faa-42ab-41dd-ba6f-1a2d113196f2-0
01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:28.110
Use all your forelimbs.

590da4fd-37c9-4d63-a96e-9800a509e97f-0
01:34:29.150 --> 01:34:30.390
That's not a good way to be.

40a2867c-cb9d-41e2-8aa7-1ce1755649b8-0
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:36.307
When you're like that, you don't want to move your body, You just

40a2867c-cb9d-41e2-8aa7-1ce1755649b8-1
01:34:36.307 --> 01:34:40.850
want to be static because you cannot enjoy physical moment.

3c486b5d-77c4-4a9a-b232-475545660538-0
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:45.175
If you keep the mind body coordination at a certain level,

3c486b5d-77c4-4a9a-b232-475545660538-1
01:34:45.175 --> 01:34:49.217
then just wanting to be active naturally comes to you because

3c486b5d-77c4-4a9a-b232-475545660538-2
01:34:49.217 --> 01:34:51.890
you enjoy just moving the body is a joy.

361dac62-38d5-466c-9333-a3e443350296-0
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:55.090
You'll dance a little more, I'm sure.

f265179f-7a90-4328-a0d6-a15fe392ec18-0
01:34:59.370 --> 01:35:04.474
This mind body coordination, you know, good coordination means

f265179f-7a90-4328-a0d6-a15fe392ec18-1
01:35:04.474 --> 01:35:08.040
you've seen the gymnasts on the television.

979cf7b5-de3f-4e23-ab65-4a0e575088db-0
01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:11.280
At least what they're doing with their body looks like magic.

2f4aba46-2c64-4574-a841-cdb1ed902b54-0
01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.000
Even with their eyes closed, they could do the same thing.

27bd9466-64c4-4c8d-9293-b9b4dff464da-0
01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.160
You can't believe your body could do this.

fb033188-c7dc-4f2f-b25a-cd86bf99be89-0
01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:18.440
It looks magical.

03005d2f-7249-4866-a9f7-bf3a6a4aee1e-0
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.680
It is just enhanced mind body coordination.

2fb595c8-3603-4326-a20f-fd983d788208-0
01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.803
Example for a bad coordination means somebody under the

2fb595c8-3603-4326-a20f-fd983d788208-1
01:35:27.803 --> 01:35:29.080
influence of alcohol.

4f71ef3b-38e1-47b2-ba35-cf7138464773-0
01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.560
He wants to put his foot here.

a40d0327-52f4-4e9f-9b03-0de9250c19b5-0
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.240
It goes there.

0d4a1b80-9009-46ce-a69d-2ba9000d4af4-0
01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:32.120
He wants to put it there.

913cec99-3192-41fe-94d9-e3cfb88be3e9-0
01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.280
It goes somewhere else.

c9a846eb-86e2-49f0-9ff5-8d070a61c105-0
01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:34.650
He knows where to go.

504c4898-88b2-464a-862f-a24f81fb9427-0
01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:37.370
It's just that the body doesn't take instructions.

10f33763-9f22-43cb-b8a4-422dec557910-0
01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:39.050
That's all that's happening with him.

dff53bb0-b998-4d1f-9f5c-b4bf6da79a58-0
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:47.904
On a certain day, Shankaran Pillai decided to initiate his

dff53bb0-b998-4d1f-9f5c-b4bf6da79a58-1
01:35:47.904 --> 01:35:49.690
son into drinking.

a097f07c-d89e-4a28-b226-db9db6a532bf-0
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:55.371
See, every parent initiates their children into whatever

a097f07c-d89e-4a28-b226-db9db6a532bf-1
01:35:55.371 --> 01:35:56.130
they know best.

9c6115ea-5c58-459e-b43e-2f911f6a1ecf-0
01:35:56.130 --> 01:35:56.610
Isn't it?

6aabd278-1f42-4d67-b559-6b83f5148d2e-0
01:35:57.690 --> 01:35:58.210
Isn't it?

a2d14307-9373-424f-8c8a-e35c4ec11665-0
01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:03.220
If you know fear, you'll initiate them into fear.

42e1ee07-f90a-4a90-be9c-c458aa7e99df-0
01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.700
If you know greed, you'll initiate them into greed.

52fc26c0-d38c-451e-8bc4-f0f4db6abaf6-0
01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:06.980
If you know love, love.

523893a3-38ce-47f3-b935-4fce607209b0-0
01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.580
If you know hatred, hatred.

dc604e42-784a-4991-b175-431665e5c450-0
01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.740
If you know drinking, drinking.

59265d8a-c12f-4e33-a095-2aa08e80d795-0
01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.300
If you know meditation, meditation.

85e74eea-72e2-493d-8327-d9543bc203f3-0
01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:13.180
It doesn't matter what.

4d7089fb-2365-4046-b3d1-018d4192dcec-0
01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:16.840
Whatever you know best, you will initiate your children into

4d7089fb-2365-4046-b3d1-018d4192dcec-1
01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.900
that, but you will do it in so many informal ways.

537c0128-ab93-41ba-9873-83ac4e877be8-0
01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.740
But Shankaran Pillai decided to give him a formal initiation.

8526b201-de1c-42b2-8afb-9f9b40ea392e-0
01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:29.495
So a day was chosen and he took his 12 year old boy to the bar

8526b201-de1c-42b2-8afb-9f9b40ea392e-1
01:36:29.495 --> 01:36:31.960
and ordered drinks for both of them.

0a9a0631-804e-4b00-99f7-08d28641d5e4-0
01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.030
And the boy, you know, looking around all these big people,

0a9a0631-804e-4b00-99f7-08d28641d5e4-1
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:41.945
sitting, drinking and laughing, talking loudly, he it's totally

0a9a0631-804e-4b00-99f7-08d28641d5e4-2
01:36:41.945 --> 01:36:42.679
new for him.

2b953d98-f0c6-4d3b-90df-d2f90587ffba-0
01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.520
He's very nervous and very gingerly slipping.

e29bb609-d29c-4395-bdf5-2e8cf2714f67-0
01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.680
He's slipping at the drink.

f130664b-1c65-40e3-a5df-d1018987bbb6-0
01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.592
But Shankaran Pillai drinking, you know, knocking off drink

f130664b-1c65-40e3-a5df-d1018987bbb6-1
01:36:51.592 --> 01:36:53.160
after drink, drink after drink.

a558fb49-1ee4-448d-90b8-6dc0a3b4628e-0
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.705
So halfway through the drink, the boy asked Father, when do I

a558fb49-1ee4-448d-90b8-6dc0a3b4628e-1
01:36:57.705 --> 01:36:58.960
know I've had enough?

389979f6-e14b-4a0d-9dba-7a532b73c5a5-0
01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.365
Because many times I have seen you on the street in the gutter

389979f6-e14b-4a0d-9dba-7a532b73c5a5-1
01:37:04.365 --> 01:37:05.240
in so many ways.

a6451a36-15c1-4689-ba94-bab882080425-0
01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.640
I don't want to get there.

7ce08223-0792-4258-877e-00a63ea58c0a-0
01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.200
So how do I know I've had enough?

1fdbf3e6-6756-4435-b285-c335238ffc0d-0
01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.200
And when should I stop?

ea162903-b5ba-43a1-909c-cf30da304b1b-0
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.360
So Sankaranpal, I said, that's very simple.

af6701e9-132f-46f1-bdca-dda983083cda-0
01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.000
You look at this and he pointed to the next table.

62e11794-e68f-4272-bd77-4fa3dc425ba6-0
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.360
Now you see there are four people sitting there.

b388c7fa-ff90-42d9-bf4e-ead772f949dc-0
01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.760
The moment you see eight, you stop.

0e7aa4b0-12b1-4baf-9bdf-7ade1ca75dd5-0
01:37:31.290 --> 01:37:38.546
The boy looked in the direction and said, But father, there are

0e7aa4b0-12b1-4baf-9bdf-7ade1ca75dd5-1
01:37:38.546 --> 01:37:46.029
only two people there, so that's bad coordination for you because

0e7aa4b0-12b1-4baf-9bdf-7ade1ca75dd5-2
01:37:46.029 --> 01:37:48.410
eye is just a camera.

aa28aa57-e7a1-44d8-9374-4743eb6c7b87-0
01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:52.490
It catches everything the way it is between the eye and the mind.

bc6ec01a-794e-440d-bdf6-fa93ffd59b78-0
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:53.810
Something is going mushy.

57bc4230-f8cc-49bc-89c9-b961c79ede23-0
01:37:54.730 --> 01:37:56.010
Coordination has gone bad.

cd3ade38-b092-412a-9be3-f943df9ab483-0
01:37:59.170 --> 01:38:02.682
You can greatly enhance your coordination, and human beings

cd3ade38-b092-412a-9be3-f943df9ab483-1
01:38:02.682 --> 01:38:05.610
can take their coordination to miraculous states.

dde7cde9-e75d-438c-b9d3-f83fe6a41f56-0
01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:09.250
You know you have seen magicians right in front of your eyes.

b367944e-f67a-4761-960f-3327f41b6634-0
01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:11.330
You can't see what he's doing.

cd4f874e-1b9b-485a-bb69-c3f12a08ec2f-0
01:38:12.370 --> 01:38:14.530
Yes, he will do it 100 times.

92fc0444-f921-4f3d-baf1-6c93144cc952-0
01:38:14.530 --> 01:38:16.330
The same trick you can't find out.

f3b55606-22cc-40de-86a3-792f46f090c7-0
01:38:17.130 --> 01:38:19.810
Have you seen this right in front of your eyes?

30fc56be-675d-42dd-b0a6-f93c84eb27c8-0
01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:21.810
He'll do this 100 times.

97227a43-bb37-404a-b468-bd2df109d17b-0
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:27.349
If he does it, however smart you are, you still can't catch him

97227a43-bb37-404a-b468-bd2df109d17b-1
01:38:27.349 --> 01:38:32.715
because it's just coordination of mind and body in such a way

97227a43-bb37-404a-b468-bd2df109d17b-2
01:38:32.715 --> 01:38:37.389
that you can do things that there are so many ways to

97227a43-bb37-404a-b468-bd2df109d17b-3
01:38:37.389 --> 01:38:42.668
stretch your coordination to extreme limits, apart from that

97227a43-bb37-404a-b468-bd2df109d17b-4
01:38:42.668 --> 01:38:44.400
by holding Kumbakka.

0e4d01e7-7e13-4ffa-9a17-69c74e802cea-0
01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.880
When you hold Kumbakka, that is the fullness of the breath.

b491d17c-fd32-4490-806b-078ccd345e9d-0
01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:50.600
When you lock it, expansion of the intellect will happen.

d5aa94ee-9c5d-4c78-96c1-b10d864af859-0
01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:54.313
Your intellectual capabilities can be greatly enhanced by

d5aa94ee-9c5d-4c78-96c1-b10d864af859-1
01:38:54.313 --> 01:38:57.820
holding the fullness of the breath with all the three locks.

737e5c0e-c8bf-47a1-a680-ee567908ae27-0
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.670
And when you hold Shoonyaka or emptiness dissolution of the ego

737e5c0e-c8bf-47a1-a680-ee567908ae27-1
01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:03.340
will happen.

744b1560-44f8-4037-9f7a-b11e89ed18f7-0
01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:10.829
So today you want an expanded intellect, so I'm not going to

744b1560-44f8-4037-9f7a-b11e89ed18f7-1
01:39:10.829 --> 01:39:14.580
let go that will Causeway damage.

7695340f-4daa-4127-89f5-99b508c1eb3e-0
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.003
Any forceful holding of the breath can Causeway damage to

7695340f-4daa-4127-89f5-99b508c1eb3e-1
01:39:19.003 --> 01:39:19.660
the system.

f63a9351-4422-46b6-a48b-741b9f21438e-0
01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:26.339
Or you want to dissolve your ego today itself, so this will

f63a9351-4422-46b6-a48b-741b9f21438e-1
01:39:26.339 --> 01:39:28.480
Causeway even more damage.

0331b04c-5a2c-4bd0-9b32-0a516f43a169-0
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.305
So forcefully depriving yourself of breath will Causeway damage

0331b04c-5a2c-4bd0-9b32-0a516f43a169-1
01:39:33.305 --> 01:39:34.160
to the system.

a8c22671-f29e-4514-8dd4-b9a0d7d5e69b-0
01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.045
You must stay there only as long as it's comfortable for you, but

a8c22671-f29e-4514-8dd4-b9a0d7d5e69b-1
01:39:38.045 --> 01:39:39.720
you stay there till that point.

eb192ff2-a5b1-4e1d-834e-25970f2a5b04-0
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:45.200
But you will see as you practice over a period of time every day,

eb192ff2-a5b1-4e1d-834e-25970f2a5b04-1
01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.622
if you practice this will see slowly the duration of the

eb192ff2-a5b1-4e1d-834e-25970f2a5b04-2
01:39:49.622 --> 01:39:54.354
Kumbakka and Shunyaka goes on increasing up to 4 1/2 to five

eb192ff2-a5b1-4e1d-834e-25970f2a5b04-3
01:39:54.354 --> 01:39:54.820
years.

7146b2c3-00a2-47d5-b3fa-4c04f56d644f-0
01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:58.533
It will go on increasing because right now most people are

7146b2c3-00a2-47d5-b3fa-4c04f56d644f-1
01:39:58.533 --> 01:40:02.020
functioning with just 15 to 20%
of their lung capacity.

1f072cd8-a485-4aa3-9eff-046148d3a748-0
01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:07.823
A very good athlete is using about 65 to 70% of his lung

1f072cd8-a485-4aa3-9eff-046148d3a748-1
01:40:07.823 --> 01:40:08.500
capacity.

8e2c7d01-348b-41e1-8d13-1a0e94a0ad66-0
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:12.006
If you do the Kriya over a period of four to five years

8e2c7d01-348b-41e1-8d13-1a0e94a0ad66-1
01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:15.163
time, you can reach a point where you're using 100% of your

8e2c7d01-348b-41e1-8d13-1a0e94a0ad66-2
01:40:15.163 --> 01:40:15.900
lung capacity.

140840f8-60db-4cf8-96ba-8c7f9e42976a-0
01:40:16.330 --> 01:40:18.090
That means how your system should be.

9fe8e4b6-351d-4b9c-abe1-a6048f0367d4-0
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:21.107
If you run up a staircase, 1
flight of stairs, there should

9fe8e4b6-351d-4b9c-abe1-a6048f0367d4-1
01:40:21.107 --> 01:40:22.610
be no disturbance of the breath.

4a22de0f-548a-4786-902c-7328635437bb-0
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:23.690
It must be just normal.

da92a313-8ce7-43de-a54a-2fd876290e89-0
01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:26.650
If it's like that, then you're in health.

d143c593-3561-45d2-addd-b63225720b2c-0
01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:28.690
You're really in health.

f267f591-8793-4eab-9fad-622b321ed220-0
01:40:29.650 --> 01:40:33.084
This is not just by doing hard work, but by just slowly

f267f591-8793-4eab-9fad-622b321ed220-1
01:40:33.084 --> 01:40:36.887
increasing the lung capacity, by pushing it little by little,

f267f591-8793-4eab-9fad-622b321ed220-2
01:40:36.887 --> 01:40:40.444
little by little, but very gently pushing, not forcefully

f267f591-8793-4eab-9fad-622b321ed220-3
01:40:40.444 --> 01:40:41.610
trying to go there.

d7e45450-4086-4d68-b63c-bd79508f0a9e-0
01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:46.530
So these are the five main benefits.

84a34dc0-a595-4a31-9559-60a3b9f20d2b-0
01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:50.860
But you should not do the sambhavi for benefits because

84a34dc0-a595-4a31-9559-60a3b9f20d2b-1
01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:52.770
these are physiological things.

93d2b7f4-79c1-408d-a2b4-689d7ba2ca10-0
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:54.890
There is something far bigger.

0f83dd33-be9c-4453-9a71-d97b0a40759e-0
01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:59.442
There is something far, far bigger in the process where

0f83dd33-be9c-4453-9a71-d97b0a40759e-1
01:40:59.442 --> 01:41:02.290
physiological benefits are of no significance.

a829b56b-2e17-4e4d-b41c-87fe0b7c972a-0
01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:04.250
Really, these things will anyway happen.

08f2135d-0768-49f0-aab0-3858d3bd4726-0
01:41:05.010 --> 01:41:08.971
The important thing is it aligns your system in such a way that

08f2135d-0768-49f0-aab0-3858d3bd4726-1
01:41:08.971 --> 01:41:12.994
the innermost core will find its expression sadhguru, that which

08f2135d-0768-49f0-aab0-3858d3bd4726-2
01:41:12.994 --> 01:41:14.480
you call as the creator.

aea2e1b1-4740-44c7-a784-1c9888cbb4c0-0
01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.192
Once it becomes a normal part of your life, life is very blissful

aea2e1b1-4740-44c7-a784-1c9888cbb4c0-1
01:41:19.192 --> 01:41:22.520
and you can live with a certain sense of ease.

af5a980e-f9c6-4a8b-a02d-cffea6899d6d-0
01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:30.709
This ease doesn't come with any amount of Social Security you

af5a980e-f9c6-4a8b-a02d-cffea6899d6d-1
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:31.280
know.

4a9ddcd5-2237-4bdf-b2bf-8364983f05eb-0
01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.103
Any amount of insurance or any amount of property or money will

4a9ddcd5-2237-4bdf-b2bf-8364983f05eb-1
01:41:35.103 --> 01:41:36.320
not give you this ease.

ed5c8601-9dde-4687-aec6-52de36a486e8-0
01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:40.853
Once that which is the source of creation is not a remote thing

ed5c8601-9dde-4687-aec6-52de36a486e8-1
01:41:40.853 --> 01:41:41.370
for you.

b036723b-1ff5-42a4-a44d-693cd42ef696-0
01:41:41.370 --> 01:41:44.090
It is a living reality for you on a daily basis.

2be4c4b8-febf-41f1-b1a8-cd89a0fcd199-0
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:48.712
Once it is so, you are at an ease which is which is totally

2be4c4b8-febf-41f1-b1a8-cd89a0fcd199-1
01:41:48.712 --> 01:41:49.450
different.

ad1fad86-4bac-4c6a-b2e6-2709125804f4-0
01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:53.566
People just don't know what it means to just sit here with

ad1fad86-4bac-4c6a-b2e6-2709125804f4-1
01:41:53.566 --> 01:41:54.410
absolute ease.

6792da34-078d-4adc-9d76-8eb26d00ed93-0
01:41:54.970 --> 01:41:56.490
People just don't know this.

e6a45b7a-1cf8-4825-9535-62e47c96a9d6-0
01:41:57.730 --> 01:41:58.810
You must know this.

08ed349a-2e7d-4ee9-8ca6-557952d6f4b4-0
01:41:59.290 --> 01:41:59.690
You know.

4df478b4-ddfb-43d4-af92-4e42d2b43c6c-0
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:02.690
Human beings should know what it means to be at ease.

a4f60f96-e143-47ed-a00e-5e624e20cc96-0
01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:03.770
Total ease.

72a6b1b0-c21d-420f-86b7-a6a887f91b3a-0
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:05.570
There is no greater joy than that.

2793b78d-2121-4d87-bc61-628899f429f8-0
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:09.470
If you sit in one place, you're absolutely at ease.

fdf490c6-4819-4d69-90e6-af728c1e9abd-0
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:14.070
There is nothing within you that you're complete by yourself.

facfaca5-10ed-4f8b-95d5-44a66eed948d-0
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:19.630
So Shambhavi is a great possibility for a thinking mind.

518343f2-87ad-4298-abd6-a63a03eb0b5d-0
01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:20.750
It's hard to understand.

3031873e-578d-4a2d-9762-a488195970b1-0
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:24.710
If I just sit here and do like this, how will my life change?

bf51d0f1-736c-4e76-8e95-21a0c7ea34ff-0
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:30.550
It doesn't make sense.

b8b50b17-918d-4604-b80b-785b1c6f70c2-0
01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:33.510
It doesn't make logical sense.

d8dfea22-3114-4452-855b-4a970f3dc760-0
01:42:34.110 --> 01:42:38.833
If I simply sit here and do like this or that, how will my life

d8dfea22-3114-4452-855b-4a970f3dc760-1
01:42:38.833 --> 01:42:39.350
change?

10dedba5-5a06-4c16-b751-09ad468610bd-0
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:46.310
That's how it is.

728d819b-d7d6-4035-94d1-d933c376e575-0
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:48.790
It's not the way you think.

4607a30d-cb5d-4e41-96d8-b455de878de3-0
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:50.510
It is some other way.

e60a8b27-e5c6-40fe-b99e-c481bf6975fb-0
01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:54.670
If you just touch that, life changes dramatically.

9345e43e-547b-4f47-8011-b516dd53b2c1-0
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:57.310
So it is so good.

5dde1280-380d-486b-93ac-6607073c08c1-0
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.870
Shall I?

7128a284-107a-49c7-96ae-a0928b01e2c6-0
01:42:58.470 --> 01:43:01.905
Tomorrow morning I'm going to initiate my son Sadhguru

7128a284-107a-49c7-96ae-a0928b01e2c6-1
01:43:01.905 --> 01:43:02.530
Shambhavi.

b0564c00-af46-4b6d-ab8b-b7b6d58f2b12-0
01:43:02.530 --> 01:43:04.370
Please don't do such things.

c72ff414-1fa4-4591-905c-9e7a5ca271f4-0
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:09.416
You will destroy your own life and his life in many ways by

c72ff414-1fa4-4591-905c-9e7a5ca271f4-1
01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:10.570
doing such things.

1811537b-4f64-4880-991f-7d20e3636a04-0
01:43:12.450 --> 01:43:13.690
Teachers are trained for us.

afee4eb8-1c20-46d3-a35e-c919b9ee5e8f-0
01:43:13.690 --> 01:43:16.530
There are teachers who have been trained for over 1215 years.

6ab7d7df-12bd-4f55-ba74-ea57397e97af-0
01:43:16.610 --> 01:43:18.370
Even they don't initiate.

a2d310ba-b17a-47d4-9e1f-c7de07cd4258-0
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:21.450
So please don't try such things.

c4ad9f3c-fefc-4552-ac37-a61d7e54e606-0
01:43:21.450 --> 01:43:22.530
It's very important.

6db71031-761b-41ea-a373-809d80b44ef7-0
01:43:22.610 --> 01:43:25.310
This has been maintained for thousands of years in a

6db71031-761b-41ea-a373-809d80b44ef7-1
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:26.330
particular sanctity.

a7a4a22c-3a87-49aa-8a2f-3d5892d71924-0
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:28.370
See, you need to understand this.

1700b3a0-b912-42ab-b343-02852ad5f584-0
01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:32.080
Anything which has the power change your life needs to be

1700b3a0-b912-42ab-b343-02852ad5f584-1
01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.320
handled with a certain discipline.

d2292a59-1434-40f8-8fc0-e5c299e9711b-0
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.120
Right now, this electricity is so wonderful.

181505d3-1924-4386-9228-1d2f121e4278-0
01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.680
It's making our lives, isn't it?

400a3fa6-f67d-419d-b7f9-ebbb056a5f21-0
01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.720
Could we do anything without it today?

328e10c7-aaa2-4784-b0e5-a2041c8249ac-0
01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.880
Could we conduct this program here today without it?

748607e5-df28-4dea-a054-c122e2b084ab-0
01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.760
So we just love it.

1b16a3de-8f1d-4dad-9df4-968794b0abbe-0
01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.257
So go and stick your little finger into that that little

1b16a3de-8f1d-4dad-9df4-968794b0abbe-1
01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:51.040
hole there.

731fcb91-58be-4b21-b792-64318575155c-0
01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.826
Because you love the electricity, it'll take away

731fcb91-58be-4b21-b792-64318575155c-1
01:43:53.826 --> 01:43:54.360
your life.

7b937d91-fb27-476f-be2b-9dcd0ff6603f-0
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.280
So is electricity dangerous?

0aa90328-767a-4ecf-bebd-d47be340ad30-0
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:00.240
Anything.

9dc2df99-03ee-42d0-a3e5-1fa3394a207d-0
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.192
Your car is making your life, If you handle it irresponsible,

9dc2df99-03ee-42d0-a3e5-1fa3394a207d-1
01:44:03.192 --> 01:44:05.240
it'll take your life in no time, isn't it?

9f859903-d13b-4026-9fd7-b10d9a322d6a-0
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.280
So is a car dangerous?

ff5ad3d0-41b0-45f5-a3b9-4f67c2e01181-0
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.560
Is electricity dangerous?

2bc6e061-6c31-4981-9f0a-306c7a78fbd9-0
01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.400
No, No.

a6a45b31-342c-414c-8a1a-458d8fc9dc8e-0
01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.440
On this planet, stupidity has always been dangerous.

3cc5572d-ce1e-4ab3-ab6f-21925c7c7bfd-0
01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.000
That's how this planet works.

e4d71e55-357e-46a9-a5fd-48f57e54b029-0
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:19.360
On this planet, stupidity has always been dangerous, isn't it?

580ecca9-6228-4685-b22a-aa6ac32b2c12-0
01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.560
So please do not try such things.

b0ec2907-1c12-473c-8ed1-607b2c427c24-0
01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.760
No experimentation.

ebcb5f16-41c8-43dc-9163-e20b5fbbc469-0
01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.431
I'm particularly saying this because this is a kind of a

ebcb5f16-41c8-43dc-9163-e20b5fbbc469-1
01:44:27.431 --> 01:44:28.720
disease in the West.

60be79a1-2429-44f0-b32f-130497589193-0
01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:31.290
People want to innovate on everything.

65ab7cdc-89a9-4602-b5c9-1751ad0c0a9c-0
01:44:31.290 --> 01:44:33.010
You don't innovate on this.

a84ee609-31ac-44a0-b2d3-d711a658cd74-0
01:44:33.250 --> 01:44:35.570
This has to be just done the way it is.

116f3b57-b35a-4111-85e4-4611c5f7957a-0
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:36.730
Do you understand?

7ed7e0e9-9fe2-4fd7-b40f-f4209c2effce-0
01:44:37.690 --> 01:44:41.928
It just has to be done the same way as it is because to initiate

7ed7e0e9-9fe2-4fd7-b40f-f4209c2effce-1
01:44:41.928 --> 01:44:45.905
this you have to understand the whole nuts and bolts of your

7ed7e0e9-9fe2-4fd7-b40f-f4209c2effce-2
01:44:45.905 --> 01:44:49.752
system without understanding every nut and bolt of how the

7ed7e0e9-9fe2-4fd7-b40f-f4209c2effce-3
01:44:49.752 --> 01:44:50.730
system is made.

02495b21-cee5-4ffc-9e7c-be7db021ad1e-0
01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:54.130
You don't try to do that because it will Causeway problems.

f7b1e097-d1d2-4073-818d-e63aab5f7f2d-0
01:44:54.610 --> 01:44:56.290
Plus you don't do any innovation.

53f18e40-0d80-437d-9479-7ecb551ee7f1-0
01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:58.250
Is the practice 100% clear to you?

78254d09-0b5b-433f-b89c-183dc45b3916-0
01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:01.060
Is it clear to you at anytime?

fd407b7c-7f79-42d0-b704-803b71a0267f-0
01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:05.620
If you have any doubt, you don't try to talk to somebody else.

050d59d7-b8d6-4e58-b10f-64a47540b24e-0
01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.620
There are people who are trained just to guide you on this.

e70ee887-c604-40d7-abad-2210cbfa1a0a-0
01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:11.602

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.500
Don't do something fanciful.

fffec44b-62e1-4dea-9236-09829fd66097-0
01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.940
It is not dangerous.

1455bb13-37ff-496b-80f5-a8f331fba210-0
01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:26.769
Everything in the world is dangerous if you do it

1455bb13-37ff-496b-80f5-a8f331fba210-1
01:45:26.769 --> 01:45:27.740
improperly, isn't it?

18adca7b-d208-412f-9205-7674074d05a3-0
01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.800
What is not dangerous?

fe273412-8486-4825-aec3-a04e91e43bd7-0
01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.160

Tell me one thing that is not dangerous if you don't do it

97bafebd-3d0d-4210-9309-8d696160f8dd-1
01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:32.880
properly.

379aa995-abc7-4f74-8b3d-3491f50cb0f7-0
01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.320
Even if you don't eat properly, it's dangerous, isn't it?

db271dbf-aa2b-42b1-94d1-2fcbcafe8ce9-0
01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:49.240
So tomorrow we'll meet at 10:30

01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:30.210
So I'll review the the timings again.

5e69cd27-6e89-4454-a7ae-6eaf46d10996-0

01:47:32.708 --> 01:47:33.410
the details too.

1efd60a2-b155-4153-9040-c810bac5c55b-0
01:47:33.730 --> 01:47:35.210
So we'll review the timings again.

912ebf21-57e8-4997-9a18-f040dc437d78-0
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:42.159
So once again, tomorrow morning

It's a practice session so make sure that you come on an empty

01:47:47.183 --> 01:47:48.010
stomach condition.

e9203052-2b50-4e48-a977-a31ac21fb47f-0
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:54.108
Then there will be a 1 1/2 hour break from noon to 1:30 PM AEDT

e9203052-2b50-4e48-a977-a31ac21fb47f-1

session which is a transmission session with sadhguru will start

f32ea5e3-2d7e-442b-affd-727bf876da46-2

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:11.560
Yes.

c203550c-51b6-4a05-b4d7-f22e7a72290d-0
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.280
So there are few guidelines for tomorrow's session.

d7634542-1591-4877-ab1f-89093e8e68b3-0
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.570
So make sure that you join the session from your home or a

d7634542-1591-4877-ab1f-89093e8e68b3-1
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:23.120
private quiet space.

3091c361-9858-4d82-ba1b-f84053b51c17-0
01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:28.709
There is no need to go to the mountain top or river bed to to

3091c361-9858-4d82-ba1b-f84053b51c17-1
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:29.400
do this.

be757e48-ba3c-49eb-8c02-b31b032639ef-0
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.400
Shambi Mahamudra can happen from your home also.

3926af70-f70a-48f6-b83d-693ae31345e6-0
01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.467
Please also make sure that your family members, including your

3926af70-f70a-48f6-b83d-693ae31345e6-1
01:48:37.467 --> 01:48:40.714
children and pets are not sitting with you during the

3926af70-f70a-48f6-b83d-693ae31345e6-2
01:48:40.714 --> 01:48:43.720
session, even if they have completed the program.

b68c133d-1b4f-4689-a305-337f58eff6bb-0
01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:50.354
And to create the right ambience around you, we recommend

b68c133d-1b4f-4689-a305-337f58eff6bb-1
01:48:50.354 --> 01:48:52.130
lighting an oil lamp.

6a778995-10d1-465d-9d17-3bef0d0e63bf-0
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:55.877
You can light this in the lamp in in in your room for the

6a778995-10d1-465d-9d17-3bef0d0e63bf-1
01:48:55.877 --> 01:48:57.130
duration of the session.

8b2de0d5-565e-4b93-a096-eb3a409eef4b-0
01:48:58.330 --> 01:49:02.601
The best is to use the sesame oil, but if sesame oil is not

8b2de0d5-565e-4b93-a096-eb3a409eef4b-1
01:49:02.601 --> 01:49:06.090
available you can use any oil that is available.

b3159617-7e4a-47c2-8279-f457d55334c3-0
01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:09.170
If you don't have an oil lamp, it is also OK.

0f8f878d-47e9-44f1-931f-3e8677eb2e6c-0
01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:14.178
So tomorrow all of you will be will be will be receiving the

0f8f878d-47e9-44f1-931f-3e8677eb2e6c-1
01:49:14.178 --> 01:49:16.380
Shambhavi Mahamuda Kriya from Sadhguru.

2671c556-ab52-42f4-aa1b-2a9328092830-0
01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:20.580
Everything that we have done so far is in preparation for this.

044af9e2-289d-4ead-8fb1-49239b86a3e7-0
01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:26.040
For millions of people around the world, this day is immensely

044af9e2-289d-4ead-8fb1-49239b86a3e7-1
01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.380
significant for them.

616fc597-f271-49c3-86ea-fdc52e677388-0
01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:32.220
So before we close, let's hear from Sadhguru.

211bc119-26ba-432d-adec-9af6f21087b1-0
01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:41.946
If you are willing, I will be available to you in more ways

211bc119-26ba-432d-adec-9af6f21087b1-1
01:49:41.946 --> 01:49:45.310
than you can logically understand.

1e2bb2a5-e95f-41b0-b0a3-f7e134a824b5-0
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:50.710
Because a Guru is not a person.

246a96e5-152f-461b-bc47-7b09096c8841-0
01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:58.026
You may meet him, you may greet him, you may even mingle with

246a96e5-152f-461b-bc47-7b09096c8841-1
01:49:58.026 --> 01:49:58.310
him.

fe5de39d-42fb-486d-9c1a-35d186e6c578-0
01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:05.182
But the personality or the person of the Guru is not the

fe5de39d-42fb-486d-9c1a-35d186e6c578-1
01:50:05.182 --> 01:50:07.030
important aspect.

518ff478-8746-40b0-8863-9e56654fdc7b-0
01:50:09.370 --> 01:50:15.968
The persona for me is structured in such a way that largely, if

518ff478-8746-40b0-8863-9e56654fdc7b-1
01:50:15.968 --> 01:50:22.669
you're reasonably unprejudiced, a persona which is acceptable to

518ff478-8746-40b0-8863-9e56654fdc7b-2
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:29.061
most people in the world, that is a carefully crafted persona

518ff478-8746-40b0-8863-9e56654fdc7b-3
01:50:29.061 --> 01:50:31.330
that is not important.

a649ad2a-b5fe-4143-beaa-4b689a8b03e3-0
01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:32.810
That is only a knock on the door.

192f941a-067f-4505-85ec-f01164744328-0
01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:39.546
But if you open the door, if your doors are open, then I am

192f941a-067f-4505-85ec-f01164744328-1
01:50:39.546 --> 01:50:44.402
available to you in more ways than you can logically

192f941a-067f-4505-85ec-f01164744328-2
01:50:44.402 --> 01:50:45.410
understand.

edc19785-73aa-435e-83de-2691f08b3f1f-0
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:53.210
Because this is a presence, this is an energetic possibility.

60bcfae5-8197-49a7-933b-fa0b3644eb22-0
01:50:54.170 --> 01:50:59.804
As I have repeatedly said, I have initiated more people who I

60bcfae5-8197-49a7-933b-fa0b3644eb22-1
01:50:59.804 --> 01:51:03.530
have not met than those that I have met.

fb81f773-f4bf-44ea-ac10-e55092fbb51b-0
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:08.410
When they are open, it is possible.

b7899575-e1c8-49eb-90db-cfa0e74d77a3-0
01:51:09.810 --> 01:51:15.510
This whole tradition talking about a Guru will be available

b7899575-e1c8-49eb-90db-cfa0e74d77a3-1
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:18.170
to you when you are willing.

ef86b7d9-3e50-4336-86f0-7599ecb5c9b3-0
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:19.690
When your doors are open.

0640cacd-d4c2-4447-b149-299fd33a6561-0
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:22.210
You have heard this in many different ways.

6be71e25-3e8f-4c39-9731-b39af1889f66-0
01:51:22.410 --> 01:51:24.170
A guru will come when you're ready.

079c4f5f-9aeb-4a4f-a14b-91f9b03cdfa8-0
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:27.850
It does not mean he has to come as a person.

158d204f-c8ad-43f4-9585-b399b06bd1ef-0
01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:34.823
It simply means when you are open, when you're ready, this

158d204f-c8ad-43f4-9585-b399b06bd1ef-1
01:51:34.823 --> 01:51:41.160
energy, this presence which is always seeking to penetrate and

158d204f-c8ad-43f4-9585-b399b06bd1ef-2
01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:46.892
make a life blossom like sunlight, is always seeking how

158d204f-c8ad-43f4-9585-b399b06bd1ef-3
01:51:46.892 --> 01:51:52.826
to touch every leaf, every flower, every life, and make it

158d204f-c8ad-43f4-9585-b399b06bd1ef-4
01:51:52.826 --> 01:51:55.139
blossom just like that.

c0339900-fbf7-44d1-9009-5b318a9f5d2d-0
01:51:55.140 --> 01:52:00.413
It is seeking because this is not of an individual, this is

c0339900-fbf7-44d1-9009-5b318a9f5d2d-1
01:52:00.413 --> 01:52:01.820
not of a person.

310c7ab3-d5bb-4425-8297-e6d786785595-0
01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:04.260
This is the nature of grace.

bf36ba93-71ab-474f-9604-2d578652eed3-0
01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:09.610
You just have to work towards your openness.

f61cde08-35de-45e1-a974-9592b2a1ef84-0
01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:18.946
Tomorrow is a tremendous possibility for millions of

f61cde08-35de-45e1-a974-9592b2a1ef84-1
01:52:18.946 --> 01:52:20.480
people around the world.

f551619f-830f-45f0-bdb8-3c360d3c7011-0
01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:24.800
The day they receive Shambhavi Mahmuda Kriya is the turning

f551619f-830f-45f0-bdb8-3c360d3c7011-1
01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.040
point in their life.

0292e606-2adb-4f03-bcb5-3bd688c76e04-0
01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:30.232
So it is Sadguru's wish and blessing that the same must

0292e606-2adb-4f03-bcb5-3bd688c76e04-1
01:52:30.232 --> 01:52:31.520
happen to all of you.

d1a37196-0d4d-4ec7-b1e4-4e548782127a-0
01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:41.160
We'll close with Invocation.

6ae066b7-6840-4e98-b801-c73571447583-0
01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:46.125
If you wish, you can stay back for additional questions after

6ae066b7-6840-4e98-b801-c73571447583-1
01:52:46.125 --> 01:52:50.080
the session is over, please hold Brahmamudra in your hands.

3763be56-f190-4e66-96fa-d82ff37e98f1-0
01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.861
Place your right palm over the left palm, palms facing upwards,

3763be56-f190-4e66-96fa-d82ff37e98f1-1
01:52:55.861 --> 01:52:57.760
loosely placed in your lap.

61ecb6cf-20b4-420c-95ce-97c66e0e4bef-0
01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:01.280
Those of you wearing spectacles, please keep them aside.

34ba66d8-2bd6-4ff1-9bca-b6122ebfd3f1-0
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:12.110
Please close your eyes and we'll say the invocation together.

d05ee450-09ba-4400-9530-7392b5966480-0
01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.560
This question is from John.

c8f0be80-c607-4d42-b4fb-1ec7e5a3e574-0
01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:42.854
When practicing each step in the future, will I need to use a

c8f0be80-c607-4d42-b4fb-1ec7e5a3e574-1
01:54:42.854 --> 01:54:47.087
timer to make sure I'm doing them for the correct amount of

c8f0be80-c607-4d42-b4fb-1ec7e5a3e574-2
01:54:47.087 --> 01:54:47.440
time?

ee6e5c0e-5f70-4925-a95f-05b4cda27c34-0
01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:53.080
So this Kriya is an internal process.

caaa63b5-6d35-4e00-93e5-2ad60c6c3b4b-0
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.320
It's a process to turn inward.

7014dfbc-c2c8-4622-bf5e-7c1490fd706e-0
01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:59.320
So if you put a timer then it will be a distraction for you.

de1672fa-7fae-49b8-8d17-84d694d52c4c-0
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:03.781
So don't worry about using the timer when you sit with the

de1672fa-7fae-49b8-8d17-84d694d52c4c-1
01:55:03.781 --> 01:55:04.190
Korea.

c05bf6d9-e9f9-416a-9535-5efe7b848266-0
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:08.070
Just be focused and be fully involved with the Korea.

487b528c-1422-40cc-83c3-c47b5819af39-0
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:10.190
The time will comes naturally.

390cccce-1405-465f-8bc3-ca736278638f-0
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:14.487
So this this issues of trying to figure out how long is 6

390cccce-1405-465f-8bc3-ca736278638f-1
01:55:14.487 --> 01:55:15.830
minutes, 5 minutes?

20b69832-52fd-4e6b-b70f-394ce7798365-0
01:55:16.110 --> 01:55:17.230
This is just at the beginning.

493d0cd5-0603-47a0-86c1-a057566d63a2-0
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:21.122
After you do it for for some time like for a few days, this

493d0cd5-0603-47a0-86c1-a057566d63a2-1
01:55:21.122 --> 01:55:23.070
will this problems will go away.

9e6850f5-91a5-4f72-8a64-f219046fc25d-0
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.590
Yes.

6bde0c6b-55c6-4d54-a166-78a421f62662-0
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:27.865
So if let's say you still couldn't figure out what is 6

6bde0c6b-55c6-4d54-a166-78a421f62662-1
01:55:27.865 --> 01:55:32.502
minutes, what is 5 minutes, Then what you can do is you can just

6bde0c6b-55c6-4d54-a166-78a421f62662-2
01:55:32.502 --> 01:55:36.854
sit on your own and justice see what how does 6 minutes or 5

6bde0c6b-55c6-4d54-a166-78a421f62662-3
01:55:36.854 --> 01:55:41.206
minutes feels for you and then you can incorporate that into

6bde0c6b-55c6-4d54-a166-78a421f62662-4
01:55:41.206 --> 01:55:41.920
the Kriya.

8bd0150f-10d4-4202-bcd0-c4797c4bba90-0
01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.400
But please do not use the alarm or the timer.

d9cc6f57-9dee-4f19-8902-3dddace8ea47-0
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.960
This question is from Shutinan.

33732d94-0a51-4daf-814c-bc2c162bbed0-0
01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.946
Can we do arm chanting separately from the whole

33732d94-0a51-4daf-814c-bc2c162bbed0-1
01:55:52.946 --> 01:55:53.480
practice?

13f14cd8-a4e3-4ee6-bdf3-0fa8a71f96d0-0
01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.891
So both Sukka Kriya and arm chanting can be practiced

13f14cd8-a4e3-4ee6-bdf3-0fa8a71f96d0-1
01:55:58.891 --> 01:56:00.640
separately out of Shambhavi.

d4ca411c-1a25-473e-bb9c-2edd36ec0474-0
01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:05.256
So yes so definitely you can practice am chanting and Suka

d4ca411c-1a25-473e-bb9c-2edd36ec0474-1
01:56:05.256 --> 01:56:06.420
Kriya separately.

bee1331e-8b9a-4411-a584-146efa3a9433-0
01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:12.441
You can and this is will be very beneficial especially for people

bee1331e-8b9a-4411-a584-146efa3a9433-1
01:56:12.441 --> 01:56:17.797
who have anxiety or depressions or if they have nightmares or

bee1331e-8b9a-4411-a584-146efa3a9433-2
01:56:17.797 --> 01:56:19.180
excessive fears.

7b613493-d46e-49c4-bd56-bc3506d0bfc4-0
01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:23.462
Ideally you can do Suka Kriya and am chant followed by am

7b613493-d46e-49c4-bd56-bc3506d0bfc4-1
01:56:23.462 --> 01:56:27.216
chanting 21 minutes, 12 minutes of Suka Kriya and 12 minutes of

7b613493-d46e-49c4-bd56-bc3506d0bfc4-2
01:56:27.216 --> 01:56:30.852
am chanting two to three times a day that will that will be a

7b613493-d46e-49c4-bd56-bc3506d0bfc4-3
01:56:30.852 --> 01:56:31.850
significant help.

93dd4fc5-ccf9-4315-9f7f-2ef2c974cc1b-0
01:56:32.170 --> 01:56:35.033
But just make sure that this doesn't replace Shambhavi

93dd4fc5-ccf9-4315-9f7f-2ef2c974cc1b-1
01:56:35.033 --> 01:56:35.450
Pamudra.

473bc8c7-9242-4cb7-b4ad-603eece35d1b-0
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:37.210
Shambhavi Mahamudra still has to happen.

2c173b95-6d26-4faa-aaa8-8df3eb3a12cc-0
01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:42.170
This question is from Swati.

4b82431d-791f-4c8f-8616-73dbb69f38aa-0
01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:46.250
Can I do Shambhavi with my 8
year old child.

5f156490-5274-4725-8de7-89fc2b7a85cf-0
01:56:48.650 --> 01:56:51.732
So when you do Shambhavi, make sure you do it in a private and

5f156490-5274-4725-8de7-89fc2b7a85cf-1
01:56:51.732 --> 01:56:53.690
quiet space and there's no disturbance.

4beea97b-9cd8-40cc-ad3d-2f6f14761eb6-0
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:57.536
So if you if you sit with your 8
years old child, you will know

4beea97b-9cd8-40cc-ad3d-2f6f14761eb6-1
01:56:57.536 --> 01:56:59.280
what happened to your Shambhavi.

97dfed29-5bb2-4cf2-9b23-4b347f7581a2-0
01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:00.960
Shambhavi might not happen.

a40231c3-a413-4ea2-b6ad-7dc59d21fb29-0
01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:05.131
So it's very important that before you sit for Shambhavi you

a40231c3-a413-4ea2-b6ad-7dc59d21fb29-1
01:57:05.131 --> 01:57:08.639
you set the the space, the ambience in such a way that

a40231c3-a413-4ea2-b6ad-7dc59d21fb29-2
01:57:08.639 --> 01:57:10.999
you're in a private and quiet space.

1bf5ae93-f0e3-4685-9563-19b6a3b8d73e-0
01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:11.720
Yes.

3aab9a8b-53bc-481a-bafd-0ad94ed796dd-0
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:19.400
So that's all this question is from Sicily.

10ebe41f-703d-44e6-bc4a-af367e834dfa-0
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.580
Any suggestions how to keep a good a good count to 21 arms?

d9591e7a-785f-4520-9bab-8bc16e50deb4-0
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:32.260
So to so for arm you do have to count them.

55f1c4b8-b8c5-4a3d-b045-b733c5e13cda-0
01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:34.060
You can count count them in your mind.

780db400-55f6-422c-8eb2-ac0770284908-0
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:37.439
Please don't use your fingers to count because then your yoga

780db400-55f6-422c-8eb2-ac0770284908-1
01:57:37.439 --> 01:57:38.340
mudra will go away.

a0a1e847-8e71-4c29-bd89-4d4e0b8692da-0
01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:38.980
Yes.

1c26000a-c357-47ba-8d18-98e956a4b7b8-0
01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:40.940
So you you should be able to do this.

76eb6361-3b19-41db-a4d6-8d3e0439edb6-0
01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:42.860
Yeah 21 times.

c93253fc-2427-40fa-be12-45422284c4a0-0
01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:46.681
It is very much within your capability to count in your mind

c93253fc-2427-40fa-be12-45422284c4a0-1
01:57:46.681 --> 01:57:47.180
mentally.

47d592bc-f9e4-4260-8f0f-7783cd301d24-0
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.660
This question is from Meenan.

45527da7-e3c2-4a9e-9ea0-c36d5c298706-0
01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:57.400
With the bandas I have no problem releasing the neck lock

45527da7-e3c2-4a9e-9ea0-c36d5c298706-1
01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.703
first, but I notice when I try to release the diaphragm lock, I

45527da7-e3c2-4a9e-9ea0-c36d5c298706-2
01:58:01.703 --> 01:58:05.940
release the inner lock at the same time as the diaphragm lock.

ae9ba161-6455-460a-8a7c-60b8f24f8df1-0
01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:08.740
Is there any advice regarding this?

616e1409-6b56-4daf-b91b-ad382b2152fc-0
01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:15.167
So as I mentioned earlier, your body might not cooperate right

616e1409-6b56-4daf-b91b-ad382b2152fc-1
01:58:15.167 --> 01:58:15.420
away.

424aeac1-faf8-4f11-a0a2-ee05bef792ab-0
01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:20.783
This is your first day doing all of this bandas, so as you go

424aeac1-faf8-4f11-a0a2-ee05bef792ab-1
01:58:20.783 --> 01:58:25.379
along, as you do the practice, you will see that the body will

424aeac1-faf8-4f11-a0a2-ee05bef792ab-2
01:58:25.379 --> 01:58:26.620
cooperate better.

0a50da7f-ddf5-41d0-a309-9036fd636f46-0
01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:30.319
So for now, just focus on making sure that you are clear about

0a50da7f-ddf5-41d0-a309-9036fd636f46-1
01:58:30.319 --> 01:58:31.220
the instructions.

34c76768-b2e6-4427-a1db-fc17d4e290fa-0
01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:39.340
Yes, this question is from DeAndre.

2bab0475-918a-475e-9e99-1b5fa4a4bd69-0
01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:45.100
Is there a more effective time of day to perform Shambhavi?

c8286572-ed2f-4621-9bb8-82044b61aa26-0
01:58:47.410 --> 01:58:50.662
So you can do Shambhavi at any time as long as there is an

c8286572-ed2f-4621-9bb8-82044b61aa26-1
01:58:50.662 --> 01:58:51.930
empty summer condition.

a66fc6f7-d4d9-42ec-b0ca-b83f01030c00-0
01:58:52.330 --> 01:58:55.290
But if you wish to use the Sandia Colas.

263a2659-d46a-4162-8ba5-9910a005f563-0
01:58:55.290 --> 01:58:59.294
So Sandia Colas is a certain timing where the nature is going

263a2659-d46a-4162-8ba5-9910a005f563-1
01:58:59.294 --> 01:59:02.718
through a certain transition which is supportive for

263a2659-d46a-4162-8ba5-9910a005f563-2
01:59:02.718 --> 01:59:04.010
spiritual processes.

076842bf-8b4e-4175-81e3-41063bc4a0c8-0
01:59:04.130 --> 01:59:05.890
So if you wish you can make use of this.

c2f3a0af-c308-4a70-9c9a-a4ff1717f9da-0
01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:08.569
But it's not necessarily that you have to wait for Sandia

c2f3a0af-c308-4a70-9c9a-a4ff1717f9da-1
01:59:08.569 --> 01:59:09.770
Colas to do your practice.

3e80adfd-2f3d-4843-a824-ebdfd5f6c3f4-0
01:59:10.170 --> 01:59:14.606
So the morning Sandia Colas is from 20 minutes before sunrise

3e80adfd-2f3d-4843-a824-ebdfd5f6c3f4-1
01:59:14.606 --> 01:59:16.610
to 20 minutes after sunrise.

8941bfa5-bfcc-4154-be9a-07c5e0dead4b-0
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:21.705
Or the noon San Jacalas 20
minutes before 20 minutes before

8941bfa5-bfcc-4154-be9a-07c5e0dead4b-1
01:59:21.705 --> 01:59:23.110
noon to 20 minutes.

1a3762cb-03dd-4726-9589-d5479396397a-0
01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:27.591
Afternoon and evening San Jacalas 20 minutes before sunset

1a3762cb-03dd-4726-9589-d5479396397a-1
01:59:27.591 --> 01:59:29.870
until 20 minutes after sunset.

37c3e69a-8798-4ca4-bc9a-d3cffb6f94c4-0
01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:34.325
But please avoid doing any meditation including Shambhavi

37c3e69a-8798-4ca4-bc9a-d3cffb6f94c4-1
01:59:34.325 --> 01:59:38.903
during the midnight San Jacalas which is the 20 minutes before

37c3e69a-8798-4ca4-bc9a-d3cffb6f94c4-2
01:59:38.903 --> 01:59:43.336
until 20 minutes after midnight because this is this is only

37c3e69a-8798-4ca4-bc9a-d3cffb6f94c4-3
01:59:43.336 --> 01:59:45.880
reserved for the aesthetic people.

aa542d89-94c2-4e1b-ac75-89efbbfa0236-0
01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.280
Yeah like the monks.

d59ae1a3-7ed9-4338-831b-862e6de6b386-0
01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:51.133
So people in social life or family situation shouldn't

d59ae1a3-7ed9-4338-831b-862e6de6b386-1
01:59:51.133 --> 01:59:52.640
meditate in these hours.

ba4b756f-8405-4faa-88b4-d17e04fda154-0
01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.280
This question is from Shantanu.

7ba8211c-637e-47c0-ad9d-3ccc383f8d68-0
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.160
I cannot touch my forehead with my knee in Nandi Pajan.

86e473d1-754a-446d-90f3-90770cf885f4-0
02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:07.647
So if you cannot touch your forehead to your knee, so you

86e473d1-754a-446d-90f3-90770cf885f4-1
02:00:07.647 --> 02:00:11.189
bring it to whatever extent that you can, but make sure that

86e473d1-754a-446d-90f3-90770cf885f4-2
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.480
your.

3759cf84-7657-41bc-aea9-9c3b391d1f6c-0
02:00:12.210 --> 02:00:15.997
Your toes is you're not resting your feet on the ground and your

3759cf84-7657-41bc-aea9-9c3b391d1f6c-1
02:00:15.997 --> 02:00:16.930
toes is pointed.

934ac5f3-b4cc-4cde-bce8-47e2b5751197-0
02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:19.730
Yes, and just make sure that you don't bend your elbows.

ecabc813-c3a9-48b6-a4e4-768b2fd77096-0
02:00:20.090 --> 02:00:22.810
So make sure that you just bring it to whatever extent you can.

2f4a9bef-3963-4b3a-aca2-3abf984193e3-0
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:26.621
Making sure that elbows is kept straight, foot pointed and you

2f4a9bef-3963-4b3a-aca2-3abf984193e3-1
02:00:26.621 --> 02:00:28.650
don't rest the foot on the ground.

670b5810-c84d-4e32-a58e-9e7d0d4c8a44-0
02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:32.906
And overtime as you practice you'll see your you can touch

670b5810-c84d-4e32-a58e-9e7d0d4c8a44-1
02:00:32.906 --> 02:00:33.090
it.

e4023277-1981-473d-9b99-b3c4feee15b7-0
02:00:33.330 --> 02:00:34.810
Yes, it just takes some practice.

196260c0-e708-4a9c-b082-056348854b95-0
02:00:37.130 --> 02:00:39.410
This question is from Kavita.

c51b9a7b-c547-4c98-b5bc-36c818a6d44c-0
02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.645
How long do we need to wait before drinking water after

c51b9a7b-c547-4c98-b5bc-36c818a6d44c-1
02:00:43.645 --> 02:00:43.960
yoga?

beca215e-b2e8-4b12-92dc-efcad2d9080f-0
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.632
So if you're drinking or having any food after the practice, if

beca215e-b2e8-4b12-92dc-efcad2d9080f-1
02:00:50.632 --> 02:00:55.264
it is off the room temperature or warmer, you can take it right

beca215e-b2e8-4b12-92dc-efcad2d9080f-2
02:00:55.264 --> 02:00:56.640
after the practice.

c7654e1e-755d-4a3b-85d1-093c702d664a-0
02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.324
But if you are consuming something cold out from the

c7654e1e-755d-4a3b-85d1-093c702d664a-1
02:01:00.324 --> 02:01:03.280
fridge, then you have to wait for 30 minutes.

a13f80de-9203-428b-9adf-dadc57cd50f6-0
02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.080
This question is from Yao.

d214e0a7-5b5f-481c-bca9-156fdbee1d3d-0
02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:15.315
How can someone with knee arthritis do the preparatory

d214e0a7-5b5f-481c-bca9-156fdbee1d3d-1
02:01:15.315 --> 02:01:15.930
asanas?

89f8b601-2cef-42a7-8cec-e1be96248259-0
02:01:18.610 --> 02:01:23.190
So you can do it to whatever extent that is possible for you,

89f8b601-2cef-42a7-8cec-e1be96248259-1
02:01:23.190 --> 02:01:27.845
but if it is not possible, you get to a point that it is it'll

89f8b601-2cef-42a7-8cec-e1be96248259-2
02:01:27.845 --> 02:01:30.210
cause severe pain or discomfort.

386b964f-56f6-4e58-8151-08cdfac3b5ac-0
02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:33.763
Then what you can do is you can sit with your eyes closed and

386b964f-56f6-4e58-8151-08cdfac3b5ac-1
02:01:33.763 --> 02:01:35.850
just visualize this preparatory asanas.

e7aeaae2-ce41-4887-9f8d-7c938ff1a20d-0
02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:40.105
You visualize it like how you redo the Nadui by Chan earlier

e7aeaae2-ce41-4887-9f8d-7c938ff1a20d-1
02:01:40.105 --> 02:01:43.100
with as much focus and involvement as you can.

17c96c4a-9df4-4269-94b7-ece68ee8f0bc-0
02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.300
This question is from Kam Sharma.

6b09b137-991c-4305-9e55-080fb13fdbac-0
02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:55.239
I'm flying for 16 hours, so I cannot do Shambhavi for twice a

6b09b137-991c-4305-9e55-080fb13fdbac-1
02:01:55.239 --> 02:01:55.540
day.

32c0c4c2-26c7-4e68-a477-26f144f46468-0
02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:57.900
Can I do that day?

df71f701-4f1a-46d5-89ca-d54071c180a4-0
02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:01.060
I'm flying for one day.

859d57fa-b46f-4213-9a50-ea0f065cd72f-0
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:04.860
Can I do one time in that day?

e3cad7d3-6edf-4a71-8df2-3bf639826bf7-0
02:02:08.350 --> 02:02:11.470
So travel may not be a limitation to your practice.

614bb421-2c5d-484e-ab8c-363c08d7df60-0
02:02:13.110 --> 02:02:17.382
So if if you're travelling for
16 hour straight on the on the

614bb421-2c5d-484e-ab8c-363c08d7df60-1
02:02:17.382 --> 02:02:21.587
flight on on the plane and you cannot do the property asanas

614bb421-2c5d-484e-ab8c-363c08d7df60-2
02:02:21.587 --> 02:02:23.310
because there's no space.

a82ea298-3d94-4e3b-a4a2-b23f0cc11962-0
02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:26.742
So only at that time you can make the exceptions where you

a82ea298-3d94-4e3b-a4a2-b23f0cc11962-1
02:02:26.742 --> 02:02:29.611
can just do the Shambhavi without doing the property

a82ea298-3d94-4e3b-a4a2-b23f0cc11962-2
02:02:29.611 --> 02:02:29.990
asanas.

abd373b9-aad0-4cb2-9c8b-aff4b3c3dea0-0
02:02:30.190 --> 02:02:34.135
So you can sit on a chair with your ankle, cross, cross your

abd373b9-aad0-4cb2-9c8b-aff4b3c3dea0-1
02:02:34.135 --> 02:02:38.209
legs by the ankle, right ankle over the left ankle and you can

abd373b9-aad0-4cb2-9c8b-aff4b3c3dea0-2
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:40.150
do the Shamba V in the flight.

758f4b34-6a6b-43dc-a7cd-4bac08122841-0
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:43.867
Don't worry that you might be worrying that, you know people

758f4b34-6a6b-43dc-a7cd-4bac08122841-1
02:02:43.867 --> 02:02:45.990
might hear you when you do the arm chanting.

a54f2503-ecc9-45ac-ba03-50a99f70ffc0-0
02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:48.150
We do it all the time.

857c52c5-c9fe-4a43-b4a0-7b119dfcd2f7-0
02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:50.110
I mean all of us.

61529569-9146-496a-8d90-85991eaa262a-0
02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:54.288
We travel all the time to to different parts of the world for

61529569-9146-496a-8d90-85991eaa262a-1
02:02:54.288 --> 02:02:58.064
classes and believe me, people wouldn't even hear your your arm

61529569-9146-496a-8d90-85991eaa262a-2
02:02:58.064 --> 02:03:01.840
chanting sometimes because it's just so, so loud when you're on

61529569-9146-496a-8d90-85991eaa262a-3
02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:02.430
the plane.

de5a9cf9-1403-458c-b30b-18b742f07aa7-0
02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.800
So don't worry about it, just do it.

704eafb0-43d3-491e-b73c-160586c20c1a-0
02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:09.073
And let's say if really they hear it, maybe they'll become

704eafb0-43d3-491e-b73c-160586c20c1a-1
02:03:09.073 --> 02:03:13.035
interested and they'll ask you about Shambhavi Mahamudra and

704eafb0-43d3-491e-b73c-160586c20c1a-2
02:03:13.035 --> 02:03:14.919
you can tell them about that.

e6f20cff-608a-484f-95e8-deaa083e8f4b-0
02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:15.760
So.

ebfbf3e9-a84b-4863-8bcd-c14f9cf7441f-0
02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:16.680
So don't be shy.

c620afa2-a216-4afd-8c03-bfffdafc58bf-0
02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.560
You just make sure that you invest this time.

3b22cf7b-dc85-480e-8e90-4b3b3bf5425b-0
02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:19.800
This is for your well-being.

ea4177c9-7427-452d-9457-1e8fbae8ac36-0
02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:20.640
Yes.

7d9e3d73-916f-4b0a-ae80-67e0a59732c0-0
02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:25.560
This question is from Shivani.

451882f9-9282-499f-81cf-efa1ad93a92f-0
02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:29.080
I have a small injury in my left ankle so.

4b002306-7d5a-41f4-93d0-fac8e48f6372-0
02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:33.120
So sitting in Arthasiddhasana, start hurting after sometime.

15079106-302b-4500-aa02-13daf0be4acd-0
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:34.870
Do you have any suggestions?

3f51578b-a3b4-41b7-99d7-5dfef0a4e7e4-0
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:41.030
So one possibility is you can try to use the cushion.

25d882c1-3b89-4327-bcda-350858d2ebfc-0
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:45.205
If the cushion still doesn't help then you you don't have to,

25d882c1-3b89-4327-bcda-350858d2ebfc-1
02:03:45.205 --> 02:03:48.689
you don't have to push it that you can just push it to whatever

25d882c1-3b89-4327-bcda-350858d2ebfc-2
02:03:48.689 --> 02:03:51.030
extent you can that's comfortable for you.

3a0d296d-e81b-4252-af8e-ef34c4286b32-0
02:03:51.550 --> 02:03:54.270
It doesn't have to touch the perineum at this point in time.

c22e7002-ccc5-459e-baf5-9dfa0accfcba-0
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:56.790
If if you have some injury, yes.

f207e805-ae82-4fff-a3b7-03f0e6b75f82-0
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:59.790
So you just push it to whatever extent you can.

adde63cb-65dc-4bf2-9a94-dd0a56d2d4fa-0
02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:03.761
So let's see if that that kind of help you to to make sure that

adde63cb-65dc-4bf2-9a94-dd0a56d2d4fa-1
02:04:03.761 --> 02:04:07.733
it doesn't it doesn't cause the pain as much but if it's really

adde63cb-65dc-4bf2-9a94-dd0a56d2d4fa-2
02:04:07.733 --> 02:04:11.581
not bearable then you can sit on a chair with the right ankle

adde63cb-65dc-4bf2-9a94-dd0a56d2d4fa-3
02:04:11.581 --> 02:04:14.560
over the left ankle until it until you recover.

bad8d0e7-ba96-42f3-80f9-2096d8270896-0
02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:21.819
This question is from Arpana can I rest my back during sitting in

bad8d0e7-ba96-42f3-80f9-2096d8270896-1
02:04:21.819 --> 02:04:23.040
at the sit asana.

42116099-df0d-4774-bfbb-f1e0b4980b70-0
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.038
So when you right when you sit in other sit asana, you should

42116099-df0d-4774-bfbb-f1e0b4980b70-1
02:04:28.038 --> 02:04:28.920
not be resting on.

e55d2d4d-d1a8-49e0-a0de-98506d6c66fb-0
02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:30.360
We should not be resting your back.

52193e26-e78b-4584-aca7-a89796aecab2-0
02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:33.740
Yes, so you should be you should be sitting away from the wall.

922590e7-c64f-430b-8915-315bc9e004e6-0
02:04:41.770 --> 02:04:49.090
This question is from muwashi my back.

bb3fbaa8-b4e9-4f67-8347-a0deb001e6da-0
02:04:49.730 --> 02:04:51.850
My back is extremely hurt.

ca370e8d-0dff-4c72-8374-3a5c36772b87-0
02:04:52.130 --> 02:04:57.725
When I do the rocking the baby practice does that mean I did it

ca370e8d-0dff-4c72-8374-3a5c36772b87-1
02:04:57.725 --> 02:04:58.250
wrong?

72373fac-205a-4568-b8f0-1e0da4a1779c-0
02:04:58.450 --> 02:04:59.330
What should I do?

6ce79705-c968-40a5-9a25-2c4f31cc2da8-0
02:05:01.890 --> 02:05:07.007
So when you do the rock the baby, So what you so if you have

6ce79705-c968-40a5-9a25-2c4f31cc2da8-1
02:05:07.007 --> 02:05:09.860
so if you cannot clasp the hands.

1d8c151a-e903-480c-bc64-ed44dd51cbfb-0
02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:12.717
So one possibility that I can think of is maybe you are

1d8c151a-e903-480c-bc64-ed44dd51cbfb-1
02:05:12.717 --> 02:05:15.727
forcing yourself to clasp the hands and that's why you are

1d8c151a-e903-480c-bc64-ed44dd51cbfb-2
02:05:15.727 --> 02:05:18.788
you're you're forcing you're you're you're hanging your leg

1d8c151a-e903-480c-bc64-ed44dd51cbfb-3
02:05:18.788 --> 02:05:19.860
and forcing yourself.

d2374a0f-41c9-451b-aa3e-dec1c6612ce1-0
02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:23.770
So if you're unable to to to clasp the hands you can just

d2374a0f-41c9-451b-aa3e-dec1c6612ce1-1
02:05:23.770 --> 02:05:27.463
bring it as close as possible and you hold the leg and you

d2374a0f-41c9-451b-aa3e-dec1c6612ce1-2
02:05:27.463 --> 02:05:28.340
rock the baby.

658a0a2b-9e74-4a0c-b402-184daefd987e-0
02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:31.420
So then there should be less pressure on your back.

d76d459a-0c40-4487-a6bb-2deb61a61899-0
02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:37.590
Yes, this question is from Dang Dang kuang.

3443cb00-6b78-42e5-8d0f-1a1f96cfff53-0
02:05:38.630 --> 02:05:43.042
Can the Suka Kriya and Kumbakka practices be practiced multiple

3443cb00-6b78-42e5-8d0f-1a1f96cfff53-1
02:05:43.042 --> 02:05:43.870
times daily?

b75da0e6-0da0-49a0-a1da-a169b7b00b14-0
02:05:45.190 --> 02:05:49.790
Are there any conditions regarding an empty stomach?

6a6f6417-c2a8-43d6-8550-eeb2cc399aa9-0
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:52.630
I'm practicing Hatha yoga exercises.

5899ee7d-988a-435c-ba3d-6ee7cc8cce69-0
02:05:53.110 --> 02:05:55.750
What is the order of these exercises?

38cd6f45-b485-4122-aea7-38a56b135c16-0
02:05:58.280 --> 02:05:59.840
So both So the bandas.

f6605665-169d-441c-a334-aa1abd3dd538-0
02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:03.011
Just to clarify again, the bandas should not be practiced

f6605665-169d-441c-a334-aa1abd3dd538-1
02:06:03.011 --> 02:06:04.160
outside of Shambhavi.

b39ba509-06c1-4090-80b5-c74a20aff564-0
02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.600
It can only be done as part of Shambhavi.

57e3a521-c0d4-4f13-b988-5e8f527fc669-0
02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:07.040
Yes.

706ba573-94b6-4aee-9c18-faf022d483b1-0
02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:11.637
So engaging the bandas in emptiness and in fullness and

706ba573-94b6-4aee-9c18-faf022d483b1-1
02:06:11.637 --> 02:06:13.280
emptiness of breath.

b934a227-5193-4334-9003-1e2dd8880b81-0
02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:17.967
So in the whole Shambhavi set on this Sukhakriya and AAM chanting

b934a227-5193-4334-9003-1e2dd8880b81-1
02:06:17.967 --> 02:06:22.280
are the only two practice that you can do outside of Shambhavi.

b33e411e-48f7-4524-8024-639728e0bcca-0
02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:24.535
The rest of them please make sure that you don't do it

b33e411e-48f7-4524-8024-639728e0bcca-1
02:06:24.535 --> 02:06:25.320
outside of Shambhavi.

46e98e21-93df-404e-ac1c-60557e09e31e-0
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.228
And in terms of what is the sequence if you you have learned

46e98e21-93df-404e-ac1c-60557e09e31e-1
02:06:31.228 --> 02:06:34.400
some of the Ishihatta yoga practice.

9443018b-474e-4b79-8f5a-7e67fd1313b1-0
02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:41.758
So the sequence will be UPA Yoga and then Anga Madhana and then

9443018b-474e-4b79-8f5a-7e67fd1313b1-1
02:06:41.758 --> 02:06:47.320
Surya Kriya Yoga, Yoga asanas and then Shambhavi.

74a7587c-ad48-4b5b-9942-4d54e7661a4b-0
02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:53.316
So I'll repeat, first is UPA, Yoga, Anga, Madhana, Surya,

74a7587c-ad48-4b5b-9942-4d54e7661a4b-1
02:06:53.316 --> 02:06:57.160
Kriya, Yoga, Asana and then Shambhavi.

124b8ee3-630e-4e76-9bb3-67c109e4633a-0
02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:58.000
So.

ed29bb02-e863-4f49-abd3-bf5dbdd20cba-0
02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:02.585
So if you are doing them in A in A in A1 go like at one time then

ed29bb02-e863-4f49-abd3-bf5dbdd20cba-1
02:07:02.585 --> 02:07:06.839
you don't have to do the Prep 3
asanas before Shambhavi because

ed29bb02-e863-4f49-abd3-bf5dbdd20cba-2
02:07:06.839 --> 02:07:11.158
before you do the either you do the Yoga asanas or before you do

ed29bb02-e863-4f49-abd3-bf5dbdd20cba-3
02:07:11.158 --> 02:07:14.880
the Surya career you would have done the Prep 3 asanas.

2334254e-5601-493e-a168-98b74463e97b-0
02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:18.094
So you can skip the Prep 3
asanas and just go straight to

2334254e-5601-493e-a168-98b74463e97b-1
02:07:18.094 --> 02:07:18.600
Shambhavi.

1f82af48-713d-424b-8d59-da31a74191dc-0
02:07:19.190 --> 02:07:21.030
But this is only if you're doing it together.

ddbb781e-ed48-4556-bf32-fa14eeb764d6-0
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:23.910
If you're doing it separately, then you have to do the prepetor

ddbb781e-ed48-4556-bf32-fa14eeb764d6-1
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:24.870
asanas before Shambhavi.

634ab017-fc28-45fb-bab4-e864955bfd83-0
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:30.710
This question is from Ujwala.

c660fdb5-5a9a-45fb-873e-a2241513a11d-0
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:37.400
Does the 21 minutes duration of Shambhavi include preparatory

c660fdb5-5a9a-45fb-873e-a2241513a11d-1
02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:38.710
asanas as well?

6471459a-2dfd-440b-b75e-65134c824c37-0
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:44.498
So the 21 minutes of Shambhavi Mahamudra, the 21 minutes is

6471459a-2dfd-440b-b75e-65134c824c37-1
02:07:44.498 --> 02:07:48.110
only Shambhavi, it doesn't include the prepetor asanas.

996c4c20-63c4-4675-86a2-9b377c09d8b8-0
02:07:48.450 --> 02:07:52.090
So the preputed asanas will take maybe another 10 to 15 minutes

996c4c20-63c4-4675-86a2-9b377c09d8b8-1
02:07:52.090 --> 02:07:54.650
depending on how fast or how slow you do it.

8b51581a-3366-4539-983c-e381adafa64b-0
02:07:57.050 --> 02:07:58.570
This question is from Himal.

5cb1415f-b141-4559-bf4a-bb2200d2fe3b-0
02:07:59.650 --> 02:08:03.494
Is it normal to have pain in lower back while doing

5cb1415f-b141-4559-bf4a-bb2200d2fe3b-1
02:08:03.494 --> 02:08:04.530
Arthasitasana?

c158d839-5259-42f8-9dcf-eff22da897c0-0
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:08.410
So there shouldn't be any pain.

76b34c01-6db9-4915-bb7e-a805a0ba0144-0
02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:11.710
I mean you might be getting muscle aches because this is

76b34c01-6db9-4915-bb7e-a805a0ba0144-1
02:08:11.710 --> 02:08:15.010
probably the first time you're sitting down for so long.

5b913143-7fbe-4b16-98a1-0fd6745ae624-0
02:08:16.170 --> 02:08:20.754
So so just see, I mean if you continue to practice the pain,

5b913143-7fbe-4b16-98a1-0fd6745ae624-1
02:08:20.754 --> 02:08:23.160
the muscle aches should go away.

651f871b-9077-4e5a-ba02-98ecb3b5e64e-0
02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:27.316
But if it's just like a pinching pain, like it's a severe pain or

651f871b-9077-4e5a-ba02-98ecb3b5e64e-1
02:08:27.316 --> 02:08:30.920
discomfort, then you can consult your doctor before continuing.

62d90114-f069-4b51-9649-4ebf879f4728-0
02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:38.160
This question is from Vamsi.

ac83cfa9-1c7a-43f9-9682-0131cd55c1ed-0
02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:43.960
Rocking the baby for continuous for two minutes is hard for me.

d22b21e3-4a41-4754-b43e-7d0c5bdf17dd-0
02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:49.250
Am I allowed to relax and start every 30 seconds?

3a3cf12d-c4dc-4785-b781-41ab725e7f15-0
02:08:51.330 --> 02:08:54.770
So when you do patangasana or Shishu Palasana, both of them.

c4a80373-18b3-445e-9ac1-d899ce7c692a-0
02:08:55.330 --> 02:08:58.950
So it's ideally you do it continuously without taking a

c4a80373-18b3-445e-9ac1-d899ce7c692a-1
02:08:58.950 --> 02:09:00.050
break in between.

d57b1480-eb39-448a-b19b-8f930e116252-0
02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:04.428
So it might be hard to do this initially because you're just

d57b1480-eb39-448a-b19b-8f930e116252-1
02:09:04.428 --> 02:09:05.770
getting used to this.

62cb7ca4-6a34-4f04-93e2-0dc8424f4b50-0
02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:09.821
So for now you can you can take a break if it if it's needed,

62cb7ca4-6a34-4f04-93e2-0dc8424f4b50-1
02:09:09.821 --> 02:09:13.237
but you should work towards making sure that you do it

62cb7ca4-6a34-4f04-93e2-0dc8424f4b50-2
02:09:13.237 --> 02:09:16.530
continuously without taking a break as you practice.

c3ccfff9-c2d4-4817-a818-dcfee77c0e3a-0
02:09:20.090 --> 02:09:24.578
So now we are running out of time, So tomorrow we'll go over

c3ccfff9-c2d4-4817-a818-dcfee77c0e3a-1
02:09:24.578 --> 02:09:29.139
the practices again and we'll go over all the instructions in

c3ccfff9-c2d4-4817-a818-dcfee77c0e3a-2
02:09:29.139 --> 02:09:30.170
details again.

eaaa1928-6ce8-47c1-b6aa-178cf18e6286-0
02:09:30.170 --> 02:09:33.837
So don't worry if you still have any questions about any of the

eaaa1928-6ce8-47c1-b6aa-178cf18e6286-1
02:09:33.837 --> 02:09:34.410
practices.

3846dfe1-e491-4578-a223-e3587a2a1f8f-0
02:09:35.050 --> 02:09:37.090
And so we'll see you tomorrow.

Make sure you come on empty stomach.

bc0ab68a-8b07-4508-bcf2-0573c38700a2-0
02:09:40.130 --> 02:09:44.690
We'll start at 10:30 AM AEDAEDT time.

426ada9f-1197-4243-9d24-bfebc39208de-0

The.

e72a8565-0ec0-42ce-b884-82aec9ba24cc-0
