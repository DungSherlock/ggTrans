4addbda6-f3ce-4007-87ad-011cd995293b-0
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.600
Why such a thing?

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.450
You must ask.

00df608d-2da2-43b9-86cc-bae5c6687cd1-0
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.231
You must ask all those people who are drinking alcohol and

00df608d-2da2-43b9-86cc-bae5c6687cd1-1
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:09.770
drugging in their lives.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.430
that they are so now.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:39.281

00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:17.950
that you will make it for always Sadhguru, if you are blissful or

60be1edf-4111-45ce-8b5b-c3101ce3d892-3
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:25.045
ecstatic every moment of your life by choice, that means you

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.023
The fear of suffering right now has crafted the whole human

e3abac3b-9432-44bf-87c2-c7007c592be8-1
00:09:38.023 --> 00:09:42.156
societies and all the structures that we have built in this

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.230
Is the fear of suffering.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.584
If not because I tell you, if it became very clear to you that it

e9c2083b-acea-4800-aa11-ae9668f43c85-1
00:09:53.584 --> 00:09:58.200
doesn't matter what happens, even if they throw you in hell,

e9c2083b-acea-4800-aa11-ae9668f43c85-2
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.790
you will be blissful.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.910
Ah, you would like to go and even explore the hell, isn't it?

9e3e0870-9bf4-4dad-bc42-7268591054de-0
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.110
Hello.

5e190c14-fbcd-41ee-9fc0-30cda2ec7601-0
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.630
Hell means, Oh my God, suffering.

24c70809-744c-4bb7-8bed-9ab045714955-0
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.920
Hell does not mean only afterlife.

12c429b0-9c99-468d-aa89-e43019478342-0
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.080
There are various kinds here.

a1f400dd-8702-417f-b3c9-ff6bf4e8d579-0
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.360
You know, acclimatization.

333daa12-c1e3-47bb-a4f3-ac0c2c9622b8-0
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.840
Each one of you have created your own kinds of Hells.

793e06a2-28fb-4dde-93fd-86999ca78953-0
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.120
Hmm.

edc9471f-a28c-4955-bdce-3060a07f7246-0
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.913
Done pretty good construction, I know, because it endures

edc9471f-a28c-4955-bdce-3060a07f7246-1
00:10:33.913 --> 00:10:37.840
throughout life and it is so innovative.

706db267-d7a1-4c4f-958b-64bee4439bd2-0
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.670
When you're a toddler, it creates a toddler's hell.

8d313c40-e335-4bfb-ae5d-b39f8a1f8632-0
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.710
When you become an adolescent, it creates an adolescent hell.

3261ce09-97a4-47ab-9db7-38b39f975fcf-0
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.070
When you become an adult, it creates an adult hell.

0a6ea6a5-bc48-46f6-92de-5820c43c8689-0
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.790
Middle age, middle age hell.

ee6f22a2-d792-4545-8a63-cd7c2548daad-0
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.230
Old age-old age hell.

6b506f8f-3dd9-4f09-87d0-f28fdf4fefda-0
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.270
And of course people imagine the hell beyond life also.

47afcdea-880d-4b51-ad49-4a321593e4e4-0
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:13.300
It is just that problem is just this.

57c198ce-f621-4f5c-a567-00bbc27f10b1-0
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:21.582
All the other creatures on the planet 95% they are determined

57c198ce-f621-4f5c-a567-00bbc27f10b1-1
00:11:21.582 --> 00:11:27.260
by their instinctive, instinctive reactions to life.

595d10fd-3893-4cd0-a134-50462343c8e2-0
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.620
That means it's all programmed
5% latitude they have.

f95f572e-c042-4179-bd44-8c12c78afc3b-0
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.982
If you pick one tiger and another tiger maybe 5% different

f95f572e-c042-4179-bd44-8c12c78afc3b-1
00:11:38.982 --> 00:11:42.043
in his characteristics, Sadhguru, but otherwise

f95f572e-c042-4179-bd44-8c12c78afc3b-2
00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:44.020
fundamentally all of them same.

4aeb97b5-4e32-4ae2-9aab-da7db7612f09-0
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.340
But for a human being, only 5 to
10% is fixed.

2b9351a4-6956-41be-b791-4ac478b9f9bd-0
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.660
90% or over 90% left in your hands.

79f77f59-bfde-465e-b493-aacf1f442ea4-0
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.340
Ah, that is the problem.

3db97b37-c79c-42a9-8c96-a59aa3a627e9-0
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.060
If you were also fixed, you would also be a OK man.

db59e3c0-713b-432b-9405-1041bbab434a-0
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:09.700
That's why so many people like to call themselves Tiger Lion.

bcffdeb7-616a-4eca-beed-a61553d1f51e-0
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.660
All kinds of things.

42920af1-c6f2-4e65-86b2-a14e1c041fc5-0
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.209
Because somewhere in their mind they feel being a tiger or a

42920af1-c6f2-4e65-86b2-a14e1c041fc5-1
00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:19.114
lion or a monkey, whatever it is they have chosen to be, is

42920af1-c6f2-4e65-86b2-a14e1c041fc5-2
00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:23.278
better than being human because they are not able to handle the

42920af1-c6f2-4e65-86b2-a14e1c041fc5-3
00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:24.319
human condition.

3046d156-9c9b-481a-aaf6-e99a02e1b21d-0
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.972
They are not able to handle the freedom that comes with being a

3046d156-9c9b-481a-aaf6-e99a02e1b21d-1
00:12:29.972 --> 00:12:30.800
human being.

f5094804-fb77-46df-8efb-6d4648dc1b39-0
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.519
I'm just reminding you, you are not suffering your bondages, you

f5094804-fb77-46df-8efb-6d4648dc1b39-1
00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:38.280
are suffering your freedom.

90286ce5-29e1-4712-a181-e19266c7ee9e-0
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.680
That is your real problem.

fd9390ca-49a7-4267-8d97-2ef198b9f05f-0
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.112
If everything was fixed for you also from within, huh, Living

fd9390ca-49a7-4267-8d97-2ef198b9f05f-1
00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:48.790
peacefully wouldn't be a problem.

47b6178c-0bb7-41e9-a5ec-27289e862de1-0
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.406
Nobody even ever went and taught a a meditation program to an

47b6178c-0bb7-41e9-a5ec-27289e862de1-1
00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:52.990
earthworm.

d0dca5fe-04fc-477d-adc6-21f22a797f3d-0
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.750
It is living quite peacefully.

b01d9cc0-c041-479d-ab18-47581a8262fe-0
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.190
If you also had the brain of an earthworm, you would be fine.

6850f7a9-3c82-467c-8872-6310acfed752-0
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:09.541
But the problem is the process of evolution worked on you for

6850f7a9-3c82-467c-8872-6310acfed752-1
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:15.948
millions of years and got you to the top place, literally on top

6850f7a9-3c82-467c-8872-6310acfed752-2
00:13:15.948 --> 00:13:17.230
of the world.

f414ff75-9d76-491d-bfa9-0d844fed5ae3-0
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.190
That's what you're suffering.

51ab52fc-da27-4737-a1da-07e7915e9f29-0
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.990
Yes, literally on top of the world.

4058b88e-bba8-4b0a-bc3d-cca2c40a5499-0
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.750
That is what you're suffering right now.

6e6b6df7-1f54-418c-bfc9-f2953dcb6f43-0
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.539
If you were at the bottom of the pile, you would have been fine

6e6b6df7-1f54-418c-bfc9-f2953dcb6f43-1
00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:36.310
because you didn't have to handle yourself.

328ce6c4-d566-4aaa-99ed-bcf8f2a8f2b4-0
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:43.267
Sadhguru nature would handle you even now because you never made

328ce6c4-d566-4aaa-99ed-bcf8f2a8f2b4-1
00:13:43.267 --> 00:13:47.130
efforts to understand how to handle this one.

1a48752f-3740-4691-bee2-c9fda7fdb0a1-0
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.330
This means.

6ee93e67-6060-4b2f-bbeb-019a9aa13b1d-0
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.730
See, just look at all the prayers on the planet.

c5b33148-3760-4388-9ad1-cf4e151f1c0c-0
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.130
Dear God, give me this.

Give me that.

63e65132-1b3b-42ee-8aba-cf2735f3ab85-0

Give me that.

db3fb52f-5ca8-455d-b720-cccb29f0e5a3-0
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.050
Otherwise, save me.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.690
Protect me.

74850034-786e-4484-9d9e-a93a7be87530-0

Hello.

f607ed40-13f1-454a-8b2b-dc5db426abd9-0

Give me this.

67028449-ecd8-4b30-8d3b-31b44232e80e-0
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.510
Give me That is about shopping.

32dce340-f604-492a-bb7c-ff0fd527e85e-0
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.670
Save me, Protect Me is about survival.

1cbda1bf-534e-43b4-96f4-48ad8859172d-0
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:12.830
Hello.

a975cb07-033b-4977-ab37-8294a30f466f-0
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.470
I'm asking is there anything religious or spiritual about it?

106fff92-8086-45a2-8957-5386d9742e0f-0
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.310
I'm asking.

c202a1b6-d362-4942-908d-df819f6c51f6-0
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.270
One is shopping.

ac297154-19a6-4dd5-9ee5-8eb00aab162c-0
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.323
You could have done it on Amazon or whatever other platforms

ac297154-19a6-4dd5-9ee5-8eb00aab162c-1
00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:25.030
which are there.

8e62f71f-ec97-4db2-afbf-63350c6d4fa9-0
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:34.750
Or saving, protecting something.

c53dbd53-d55c-4ecd-8bdc-90871944b664-0
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.070
You can take care of Indiana so many different ways.

f4fc32f0-533e-415e-a771-d0805a2f711c-0
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.407
Essentially what you're trying to do is the freedom that's been

f4fc32f0-533e-415e-a771-d0805a2f711c-1
00:14:42.407 --> 00:14:45.390
given to you as a human being by this creation.

132f7069-3d29-4f96-b2e5-ec7bb2a4a069-0
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.110
You want to throw it back.

e960a730-d006-41d5-ac9a-ac001b3c6fbd-0
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.910
Please, somebody handle my life.

d0d4df83-5f1e-4aa2-b3e6-1bef374a1909-0
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.150
That's why you got married.

7bd7d693-5144-44ba-a9ec-64e276195491-0
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.350
Hello.

675021b2-0158-4425-89f7-9607d0dd9613-0
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.510
But that's not working like that.

e87f89d0-a9b0-4775-a8d8-96b651465c80-0
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.930
Now you have to handle yourself and the other person, Sadhguru.

cdfe5174-f2fe-4d7f-8188-2f9892779b9d-0
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.490
You thought if you get married they will handle everything.

54f897e5-b93d-4272-921f-b8388298c024-0
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.286
But now you have to handle yourself and also one more

54f897e5-b93d-4272-921f-b8388298c024-1
00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:08.690
person.

c2c7dbbb-0aff-42a1-ac99-597209c9bbfc-0
00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:10.930
Double trouble.

c572e46e-5d6c-40ed-9acc-cb072ed5104c-0
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.690
The problem is not about being a child.

d2315dc5-446c-458b-94ec-ab92acfa9d8d-0
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.890
The problem is not about being an adolescent.

eeca5167-0c3e-416e-bf7c-2e0cd583a8d8-0
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.370
The problem is not about adulthood.

84c35b55-10be-400b-b5ce-6820e27d4e86-0
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.450
The problem is not about marriage.

ee4e86fb-4cb0-46c0-aa74-a346a3f0df76-0
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.370
The problem is not about your business or profession.

46604bb2-fcd7-4f39-b0eb-7bfc5ca1289e-0
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.167
The problem is you have not learnt how to handle your own

46604bb2-fcd7-4f39-b0eb-7bfc5ca1289e-1
00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:36.950
faculties.

77575949-24be-4004-b63e-e2c647535c3f-0
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.976
This has not happened simply because everything causes pain

77575949-24be-4004-b63e-e2c647535c3f-1
00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:42.910
and hurt and trouble within you.

e5e5dfc1-af85-4549-839c-1659df6aaf7b-0
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.467
Only and only when there is No Fear of suffering will you be

e5e5dfc1-af85-4549-839c-1659df6aaf7b-1
00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:53.630
able to walk your life full stride.

580b3111-b0c8-47df-842d-c5ddabd5f4a3-0
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.957
Otherwise, always what will happen, what will happen, what

580b3111-b0c8-47df-842d-c5ddabd5f4a3-1
00:15:56.957 --> 00:16:00.190
will happen, What will happen means what suffering may come.

bd841273-2ec7-48f6-aba2-26d52de7d37c-0
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.300
That is the whole problem.

79cb56e7-528e-4dec-b663-90517782cf13-0
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.382
If that one thing is removed from your life, the fear of

79cb56e7-528e-4dec-b663-90517782cf13-1
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:06.980
suffering.

f6f73fc0-d380-4d67-9086-6cbe267ac7ef-0
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.660
Whatever happens, this is how I will be.

bbe3f99b-865e-40f5-b166-274b41893c02-0
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.865
If this assurance was there within you, TCH, I think you

bbe3f99b-865e-40f5-b166-274b41893c02-1
00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:18.900
would explore many many, many more possibilities of life.

538f4d0b-8819-4627-a020-4cdbb29f2597-0
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:19.820
Hello.

7732b69f-228b-46c2-b16e-ee746cca118c-0
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.300
Definitely you would.

2af0b1b1-d2ed-4f4b-8ce0-4238596ded7d-0
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:31.059
So Shambhavi is is about that to activate sadhguru system in such

2af0b1b1-d2ed-4f4b-8ce0-4238596ded7d-1
00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:34.770
a way being blissful is not an effort.

b9b61497-672f-4af6-bccd-8368444e5e02-0
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.290
You're naturally bliss blissful.

9a7bb7ef-8062-4a32-a853-5dbb0a13712a-0
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:43.050
But today is not a romantic day.

c0a5d97d-215c-4832-af46-f5a10012cde7-0
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:49.210
Today is a mechanical day, because today we are not

c0a5d97d-215c-4832-af46-f5a10012cde7-1
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.610
romancing her.

d40ecd9c-7a4c-4ee7-b528-e281eea02ee3-0
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:56.645
Today we are building a device or a tool or let's say a key to

d40ecd9c-7a4c-4ee7-b528-e281eea02ee3-1
00:16:56.645 --> 00:17:02.160
put it simply, Sadhguru, suppose you were locked in this room.

a56a8671-0106-4fcd-b6a2-a4fa1c17fbc0-0
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.920
I see many of you sitting in your own rooms.

454814ee-dd06-46df-9de2-b44a1e48aa42-0
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.080
Somebody is lying down and doing it.

f9b76d05-7659-4a3d-b259-3b7ee5b4883f-0
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.720
Somebody is standing up and doing it.

82894fc9-a6ee-40c1-9258-0bb1c997b341-0
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.080
Don't do all that sit down properly.

4576de1a-f8b8-423b-904c-e5cee747e118-0
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.000
I see many parts of the country that you are.

c4012a7f-5f13-4ebb-840e-80414f79054f-0
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.030
Some of you are talking to your somebody at the family just

c4012a7f-5f13-4ebb-840e-80414f79054f-1
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.915
little bit and come back and taking off the headphones and

c4012a7f-5f13-4ebb-840e-80414f79054f-2
00:17:25.915 --> 00:17:26.640
doing this.

6a29e040-3717-465e-a6ce-0b29cd6335bc-0
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.000
Not hearing two sentences and again coming back.

05cd67b4-b268-4942-9bc8-123e2e84b508-0
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.974
Please stop all this for the next few hours because I said

05cd67b4-b268-4942-9bc8-123e2e84b508-1
00:17:33.974 --> 00:17:35.820
this is a mechanical day.

2a204274-a072-49fe-9f89-80981256dbf3-0
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.100
If you were doing romance anyway.

e2f3b9a8-d0eb-47ae-854d-3052866437e2-0
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.580
They were saying sweet nothings.

abeca880-9a71-4139-a5cb-fefa27346cc7-0
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.380
You could miss it.

bf0afbfd-7639-49c9-b040-b8559aef9178-0
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:41.820
Hello.

109b2bea-3ba9-435e-886c-dff055054b16-0
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.060
You know their intention.

0a2ca96d-4948-4c44-abb5-a9c28be5a27f-0
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.100
I'm saying so you miss the words.

96064c85-b1e6-4369-a68d-3b50c2a3e07e-0
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.140
It doesn't really matter.

7dea6a1d-95e0-4197-94c6-1f5f8545bd63-0
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.260
This happened.

d69b508e-a5a6-49e5-8093-736872cd5f31-0
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.580
Let me tell you all of you who are on and off.

0dcb4e1e-fdd0-44e5-9eff-cae9e1610844-0
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.620
Let me tell you this happened.

09be7c48-cd32-418b-b825-263745a8a588-0
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.911
Shankaran Pillai had to go on, you know, a training process in

09be7c48-cd32-418b-b825-263745a8a588-1
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:05.000
the career that he was working for one full year.

c9e896e5-ade1-4e7d-9641-e9f1c937bcf5-0
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.840
So his wife said it can't be how can you be away for one year?

75b1cb28-c481-479c-ac44-17763ecf7003-0
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.991
I'm going to miss you terribly so he said these are pre e-mail

75b1cb28-c481-479c-ac44-17763ecf7003-1
00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:18.400
days.

cfe063ff-b2c8-4110-81a2-aad7b077eb70-0
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.480
So he said every week I will post a postcard to you.

fc10b7ab-1366-4fbe-899d-4376d228e3a1-0
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.480
I will make sure I do this for you so that you don't miss me.

b5d4f3aa-a018-4964-8290-2f02618f4471-0
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.473
These days you're not giving them any chance to miss anybody,

b5d4f3aa-a018-4964-8290-2f02618f4471-1
00:18:34.473 --> 00:18:38.033
because five times in a day you call and 25 times in a day you

b5d4f3aa-a018-4964-8290-2f02618f4471-2
00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:41.650
send a message, nobody has any opportunity to miss you anymore.

95913564-4fb3-499c-a702-7c6d206ca003-0
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.925
So Shankaran Pillai went away for one year of training as he

95913564-4fb3-499c-a702-7c6d206ca003-1
00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:50.930
had promised.

332645aa-b2de-4509-b641-da1123540621-0
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.810
He took a postcard and wrote whatever dear her name.

3ca532c7-0ce2-41fe-ab4b-69744c77c932-0
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.720
I love you and I love you and I love you.

cb3ee8ec-e55a-45fa-bfba-f202ef1a7c90-0
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.240
I love you like nobody else can ever do.

0b72f51f-ca0f-4bac-a8af-5dfea17ef7ed-0
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.560
My love for you is the greatest love in the world.

24506f8d-c8ed-49a7-b8a0-40577d09b5ef-0
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.880
You heard these words recently.

8a3a5809-b58d-44bb-a62f-3a563e16ae4b-0
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.240
OK?

6b504b1a-423b-403e-bdbd-cec5b7925252-0
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.960
And I will always love you.

a825195c-ad42-4185-a916-a45efecfdf7b-0
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.080
Hugs, kisses, and no, no, no, no, no, no.

d6810da5-b905-451b-ae5c-2e675c26c3c3-0
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.080
She was overjoyed.

b4802cd2-b609-41cb-8909-0f3834d80c99-0
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.100
Sadhguru.

e83460b6-8fbe-4ead-a4ec-9941468588a9-0
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.300
After that, week after week, postcards kept coming.

acfb9c08-f606-4532-b68e-81596d0b691a-0
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.620
But there was only one word.

f3bfb235-a04e-4d04-a9a0-cdf2414b6db7-0
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.140
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto, Ditto.

071b70c5-118f-405e-ae2c-f1303a115ee6-0
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.860
He bought 52 cards and wrote Ditto, Ditto.

bedd1836-225b-43d1-a1ec-8e7574e2aad3-0
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.492
And weekly, Weekly he posted for her because he's already said

bedd1836-225b-43d1-a1ec-8e7574e2aad3-1
00:19:44.492 --> 00:19:45.620
everything he wants to say.

671b02fd-9dd8-401f-860d-a61b38be5fd7-0
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.821
So if I was saying sweet nothings to you, nice things to

671b02fd-9dd8-401f-860d-a61b38be5fd7-1
00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:56.491
you, you miss one sentence and you come back again, it doesn't

671b02fd-9dd8-401f-860d-a61b38be5fd7-2
00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:59.230
matter because, you know Sadhguru's intention.

dcacc03f-992c-41b0-bf20-7f1616c5c04f-0
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.510
So this is a mechanical job.

f4e5f2b2-0e75-42ba-aad6-d710e3b33652-0
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.070
We are doing nuts and bolts.

b68d7dc3-67e4-43c5-a9b7-989a5424d1f0-0
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.392
So just when I was about to fix a most important nut, you went

b68d7dc3-67e4-43c5-a9b7-989a5424d1f0-1
00:20:12.392 --> 00:20:13.470
to the bathroom.

774c68d8-017c-4fe8-bf46-04a430361c70-0
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.070
You're talking to your friend.

3f10f904-552a-4bc4-b6e0-66c72d45d31d-0
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.670
You thought you can attend to your messaging system.

4188c58f-e5c8-4854-86ff-8379adeb2c32-0
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.350
TCH, oh, without that one nut, you know, that's when you call.

dbb76bbf-2d72-4b50-bd79-c546d526cd02-0
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.270
It's very.

93105d5b-2b7b-49ee-bd91-b9ac00f6ee30-0
00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.250
Sadhguru language is a very quirky thing.

221981ee-ca0a-47e0-9b29-bcd70fde22e7-0
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.450
When you don't have a nut, people call you a nut.

056f33f7-fb61-45bc-a3b2-676c46d706c5-0
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.490
What is missing is what you are.

838084f4-66b5-4fc2-855e-823432be8e87-0
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.370
So please all of you wherever you are.

89883838-1f52-4ec5-b6f6-3b54cc38f464-0
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.814
I want you 100% undivided attention because without that

89883838-1f52-4ec5-b6f6-3b54cc38f464-1
00:20:40.814 --> 00:20:43.410
this is not going to happen.

1b2cfbb6-ef4b-4614-b624-7bc10ce91990-0
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.970
People have asked, people have been asking me questions.

8dd7f474-797e-409e-b4bf-ece01742e78c-0
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.130
Sadhguru will it really work online?

6c151aaa-dbc7-4c25-851c-59f773f47707-0
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.410
I said even online is not needed.

985176ac-abe5-49da-a792-6918cda05f97-0
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.250
All these connections and technology not needed.

2c0c96b5-8f76-48fb-b8f7-26a56636ec8d-0
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.860
If you fix the time and you're ready and absolutely focused

2c0c96b5-8f76-48fb-b8f7-26a56636ec8d-1
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.970
without a word, we will initiate you.

c6a975d9-3af8-4b9a-b32e-230417bdb6a9-0
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.530
All that is required is your focus.

57f007c4-996e-4afe-9dad-01f5ade765a6-0
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.010
Now.

7c5cedaa-8322-44e2-a252-0f04ecc07f97-0
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.290
Technology helps you to feel that you're being attended to.

e51d910c-439e-48de-9e1c-2faad6871908-0
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.410
I'm looking at you.

7b043516-8476-4554-aba8-8cf4bf8115da-0
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.730
That's why I know what you're doing, all of you.

df91e21c-1451-4d4e-8186-9ae041d6d3c7-0
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.570
So make use of this.

dc9182ef-6240-4587-babb-e93ec312da2d-0
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.810
This is a tremendous opportunity, Sadhguru.

4119cc29-e3a3-428b-9ab5-31c6803e199f-0
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.600
Never before in the history of this humanity was it possible

4119cc29-e3a3-428b-9ab5-31c6803e199f-1
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.328
that thousands of people can stay focused on one thing from

4119cc29-e3a3-428b-9ab5-31c6803e199f-2
00:21:30.328 --> 00:21:32.130
different parts of the world.

2d9d7da6-7818-4e04-91a7-75c26bbe81ae-0
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.055
This opportunity has come to you thanks to all the technology

2d9d7da6-7818-4e04-91a7-75c26bbe81ae-1
00:21:36.055 --> 00:21:36.770
that is there.

1b00e2e7-1914-4674-8024-911dc629d4d7-0
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.103
But I want you to understand any initiation process or the

1b00e2e7-1914-4674-8024-911dc629d4d7-1
00:21:41.103 --> 00:21:44.436
Shambhavi Mahamudra doesn't happen because of the

1b00e2e7-1914-4674-8024-911dc629d4d7-2
00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:45.169
technology.

df858977-c745-4dca-87d8-31a6c9917790-0
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.130
Technology helps you to stay focused.

63288a3c-ba33-401a-97de-a51891245462-0
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.855
If you could stay focused, even without technology, Sadhguru,

63288a3c-ba33-401a-97de-a51891245462-1
00:21:51.855 --> 00:21:54.440
without seeing my face, without hearing my voice.

f147bdd0-a951-4975-a131-19af16808223-0
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.458
If you could be absolutely focused any way, we would

f147bdd0-a951-4975-a131-19af16808223-1
00:21:57.458 --> 00:21:58.160
initiate you.

c2c05c55-772e-4066-8a78-e2800fd869bc-0
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.600
Because that's all it takes.

e03de168-04aa-46c8-9fe4-a31094cc4782-0
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.628
So please do not because you see the picture and you're not

e03de168-04aa-46c8-9fe4-a31094cc4782-1
00:22:04.628 --> 00:22:05.200
listening.

c15e2dae-0b94-4aec-8ef4-92d236ba8f6a-0
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.840
Don't think you're getting something.

7d0d5cf1-0597-4663-9f66-9c085d09442e-0
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.440
No picture is not the important thing.

4df3f9cd-e05c-4588-8457-b53f617129fd-0
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.920
The voice is not the important thing.

0f8ddd6d-ee6b-41d7-92ea-a785e6f8e908-0
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.778
Your focus is the most important thing in this whole process For

0f8ddd6d-ee6b-41d7-92ea-a785e6f8e908-1
00:22:16.778 --> 00:22:17.560
all of you.

ae3c762b-a910-4a7e-a4bc-ccc5c822709c-0
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.087
This is a opportunity, Sadhguru, that doesn't come too often in

ae3c762b-a910-4a7e-a4bc-ccc5c822709c-1
00:22:22.087 --> 00:22:22.680
one's life.

7406193d-b91c-4062-ba64-fea1d3193bc7-0
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.120
For most people, it never comes.

803444c6-790e-485f-83b6-f8d0456f0c99-0
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.598
Now that we are together here, please make sure it happens if

803444c6-790e-485f-83b6-f8d0456f0c99-1
00:22:31.598 --> 00:22:37.619
you allow this dimension to percolate into your life, if you

803444c6-790e-485f-83b6-f8d0456f0c99-2
00:22:37.619 --> 00:22:43.935
craft a good key, opening up the doors of many possibilities is

803444c6-790e-485f-83b6-f8d0456f0c99-3
00:22:43.935 --> 00:22:45.120
very simple.

075103cc-d04f-495b-a54c-a5a13218c7e8-0
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.980
If you're locked up in this room or in your room, wherever you

075103cc-d04f-495b-a54c-a5a13218c7e8-1
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.389
are, and if you do not know the concept of what is a lock, what

075103cc-d04f-495b-a54c-a5a13218c7e8-2
00:22:55.389 --> 00:22:59.729
is a key, And if I give you a key or let us say a key dropped,

075103cc-d04f-495b-a54c-a5a13218c7e8-3
00:22:59.729 --> 00:23:02.209
TCH, giving doesn't work like that.

b3a938c0-7e4e-4449-bd9e-ba2b2a6ae993-0
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.850
You know you wanted everything to fall from above.

e143fb73-88a8-41e4-9e77-4520aeb6cd20-0
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:06.130
Hello.

0a72fbd3-2be6-42f3-8375-a2dd012426d4-0
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:11.297
Generally it must fall from above, though everything

0a72fbd3-2be6-42f3-8375-a2dd012426d4-1
00:23:11.297 --> 00:23:14.410
valuable in this life came from earth up.

0531ebf9-7234-40c3-9358-3159258d2797-0
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:15.850
Hello.

ff1ce3cd-52a5-4a89-8d8b-b93626627441-0
00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.440
Your food came up like this, Sadhguru.

47f7172d-671e-4d11-92c6-78e886db19f9-0
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.600
Everything came up like this.

2f669d09-6985-4d67-b624-80d099e33e1e-0
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.219
But somehow this fanciful idea, the most valuable things will

2f669d09-6985-4d67-b624-80d099e33e1e-1
00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:26.560
fall from the sky.

90e2a1c3-8596-4457-9862-2ad22c3b5c5c-0
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.040
Oh, but rain is coming from the sky.

4fc372f2-7d68-4376-9f4e-879eab00fa81-0
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.840
No, no, no.

d3cc4e0d-e7d6-4f49-90d1-9d8e9708f77c-0
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.840
The Earth sent the cloud up and then got it back.

6592ba33-d8d8-4742-a000-025d970f026c-0
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.600
Hello.

65341655-4daa-4894-aa5f-01ad232d032e-0
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.000
Like it has put you up right now and it'll get it back.

e91d287a-1f69-4288-808c-38f41c130069-0
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.040
You have any doubt?

a45ee77e-8dc6-4df7-b4bb-14bb080d2d15-0
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.600
Hello.

1d7eb397-2e7b-49b4-9a27-b39e550ac122-0
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:50.441
Mother Earth is playing a yo-yo with you in that yo don't do too

1d7eb397-2e7b-49b4-9a27-b39e550ac122-1
00:23:50.441 --> 00:23:55.690
much yo-yo, yo little yo out and in, pop up pop in.

0c92d99d-6ad5-4313-b5d1-3a0c750938e3-0
00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.170
Yes, that's all it is.

f6edd0bf-aded-4709-a0d6-cd58df886af9-0
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.530
So don't make too much fuss about your existence.

1c790d30-1251-4d14-8018-4638423b7341-0
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.810
It's too brief to make fuss about.

237eccb2-cf12-40d3-bcff-26de92b47e6e-0
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.570
It is important that you make the best out of it.

4d6e60d3-5a72-41f5-8a9d-a8748729ae89-0
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.890
This brief time that we have is life.

64295629-c927-4522-b9ef-c1d66bb60c9a-0
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.530
Very brief time that we have as Shambhavi initiation.

b3c0e14c-699a-406f-aa74-6bd25f4c8665-0
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.210
Let's make the best out of it.

dd361d12-f526-4c80-8988-3e23a089c6bc-0
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.010
Don't go here and there in between.

c2be713c-538f-49b3-9957-ae25ef9a949e-0
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.450
OK.

5b2d8199-fd09-48c7-b4e7-939e357b8302-0
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:23.770
Hello.

3e5ae263-c1ef-47c0-aed2-9f1a24a490b6-0
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.370
Hello.

46b137b5-b870-4e10-a448-fa59c77ba5e0-0
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.730
Hello.

8274537b-1e58-4501-bad5-0314f26d84e9-0
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.930
The problem with this technology still is I can't hear you.

4478107b-77b1-4494-8d6b-e2aaf3815f48-0
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.690
But whether I can hear you or not, I want all of you to chug.

8b08b94d-0848-4b18-8677-c09e17f6c244-0
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:34.090
Who?

b71c6535-0701-4751-b548-08670d2ef4b0-0
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.130
That's all you have, huh?

eb9fa4d1-9df9-4218-b6d9-b4a72eb9858e-0
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.490
That's all life you've got.

d2468a30-a0f8-438d-9391-72e23c73c100-0
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:54.996
I'm telling all of you, wherever you are, you're not getting the

d2468a30-a0f8-438d-9391-72e23c73c100-1
00:24:54.996 --> 00:24:56.460
message.

fd0afe90-ec3f-47bc-a076-ef0ee9083bf2-0
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.340
You didn't hear me yet.

effc0e07-bbc0-4441-af15-63d2b1d7913f-0
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.300
There's a delay.

862bb6ef-456c-4bda-ac4b-4a6b4cc28592-0
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.300
Is it OK?

43b46df4-d33f-4b80-ad0e-d7dd2e7cf11f-0
00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.140
You're slow.

f6f14a69-672f-4eee-b2a6-11e8b2251626-0
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.260
Got it.

02d0190a-123a-43b7-831e-870b916fc31c-0
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:15.500
Oh, yeah, That's OK.

e989b1d3-7dea-40a2-b452-4d273acce165-0
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.220
There's a little bit of delay in technology.

2b99bd06-af2b-4650-a29a-396f621b2210-0
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.020
That's all right.

84114051-36c5-4586-9d20-1ec5cbed74f7-0
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.990
So what is it that we wish to do today?

c32ff0d7-272b-4e28-8a6b-87abb95751c3-0
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:32.252
First and foremost thing is, there are too many false

c32ff0d7-272b-4e28-8a6b-87abb95751c3-1
00:25:32.252 --> 00:25:33.910
concepts in our mind.

1c5e2a40-3260-42ed-90a6-5a84856560c8-0
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:39.134
All kinds of ideas, concepts, definitions, lies that

1c5e2a40-3260-42ed-90a6-5a84856560c8-1
00:25:39.134 --> 00:25:44.007
generations of people have repeated without knowing a thing

1c5e2a40-3260-42ed-90a6-5a84856560c8-2
00:25:44.007 --> 00:25:48.149
about it have unfortunately been inherited by you.

6ef7397f-c632-4ee9-a949-ab8f227dc323-0
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:55.500
Also, when I say a lie, I'm not saying it is untrue.

a849f2c7-255d-484f-a001-f7f054771979-0
00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.700
It may be true, but you do not know.

e2dfb34b-bf7d-4bba-8c9f-f227c2a7ad03-0
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.140
If you say something that you do not know, is it a lie?

d725d907-57f7-4d51-8536-2bc5f0c2357e-0
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.380
Hmm.

f0ea1610-266e-4008-98ba-37ed7a0e78d9-0
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.220
Because you do not know.

7b95f98f-303f-4cf6-988d-a97b943653e3-0
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.140
How do you claim this is the truth?

b8f39d68-396e-45de-a98d-1cedd3009054-0
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.260
If it happened to you, then you know it is the truth, but you

b8f39d68-396e-45de-a98d-1cedd3009054-1
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.100
simply say it.

ede55e56-8721-4d06-916c-d74bd76ffb88-0
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.517
So in this context you are speaking something that you do

ede55e56-8721-4d06-916c-d74bd76ffb88-1
00:26:22.517 --> 00:26:23.130
not know.

ffc9b1d7-6b5f-4958-8418-6334454a2d76-0
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.410
In this context a whole lot of things are lies in your life.

ed16648d-9b46-4f48-8b46-4b1d463500cd-0
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.157
At least you must be sincere enough to say OK somebody is

ed16648d-9b46-4f48-8b46-4b1d463500cd-1
00:26:33.157 --> 00:26:33.810
saying it.

21faa46f-dcec-418b-b2fa-0a2a25cd39eb-0
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.930
Maybe it is true, I don't know TCH.

0cdcdabc-2e4a-464c-95a3-b5500f6680c0-0
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:41.167
If you do this, opening up your inner dimensions become a

0cdcdabc-2e4a-464c-95a3-b5500f6680c0-1
00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:46.117
becomes a very simple process if you have concretized yourself

0cdcdabc-2e4a-464c-95a3-b5500f6680c0-2
00:26:46.117 --> 00:26:47.610
with too many lies.

5d7969c1-d926-4de3-a332-3b574ff84f4a-0
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.910
Lie is a strong word.

06d7bdfb-3dc1-4531-b2f2-4e3b2907a41a-0
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:56.675
We can call it belief systems, we can call it ideologies, we

06d7bdfb-3dc1-4531-b2f2-4e3b2907a41a-1
00:26:56.675 --> 00:26:58.710
can call it philosophies.

f66840a3-d37d-403f-863a-a2d334a4c2b0-0
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.710
These are nice words, but actually it's a lie.

77353063-d3f1-4d71-bc6a-0abb829e6ee1-0
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.954
You made-up something in your mind and go on insisting that is

77353063-d3f1-4d71-bc6a-0abb829e6ee1-1
00:27:05.954 --> 00:27:07.670
the truth in the existence.

d18d4a08-b277-4928-9e60-8679b1f8cbc3-0
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.710
Now, I don't want to rub you through this.

24e29a4c-b1d8-4de0-9d33-d3d6b665eb63-0
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.201
You know what I'm talking about, Sadhguru, How did you arrive at

24e29a4c-b1d8-4de0-9d33-d3d6b665eb63-1
00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:19.100
these things?

a5e158e9-4817-4a5a-916a-7282033dc4c4-0
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.780
There are many ways.

3c82aac5-802d-4e3f-80df-8f188d8c9208-0
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.844
Different people arrive at it in different ways depending upon

3c82aac5-802d-4e3f-80df-8f188d8c9208-1
00:27:24.844 --> 00:27:28.020
their social backgrounds, different times of history.

e1076c48-10c5-44aa-b223-f7bd298a7855-0
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.140
They do it in different ways today.

98a645d1-36ec-4ef9-bca6-4c07f4550309-0
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.633
Also depending upon where they are born and what kind of

98a645d1-36ec-4ef9-bca6-4c07f4550309-1
00:27:34.633 --> 00:27:38.310
atmosphere they've grown up accordingly, they make up these

98a645d1-36ec-4ef9-bca6-4c07f4550309-2
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.740
things.

ad801b33-6ba7-44e9-a07c-92570f5aad20-0
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.660
This happened in New York City.

7672c844-e68f-40bb-a64a-1caad277cda3-0
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:49.350
A 8 year old boy came back from school the afternoon 3:00.

80164ad7-8f33-4965-82a2-955fe62c4fee-0
00:27:53.030 --> 00:28:00.563
His mother was not there because she's gone to work and she came

80164ad7-8f33-4965-82a2-955fe62c4fee-1
00:28:00.563 --> 00:28:02.070
back at 4:30.

1b417f4e-50d1-4862-8576-7a1e0d0740f6-0
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:10.550
She's a very progressive woman and of course she's single.

a4df526d-a92f-4f23-aca0-da6fb90897c8-0
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:20.380
And then he asked his mother, Mama, is God a man or a woman?

9c39a537-52b7-45c2-a2f3-b38f73bf95be-0
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.940
She thought about this.

556921ff-5d09-4546-bce5-83106b63568f-0
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.460
There are various political issues about it today.

45cedbff-ca92-4733-95fb-b25851b023dc-0
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.460
Everything is political.

04541244-a337-4c17-85c3-034d84ec6f5e-0
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.820
It doesn't matter what you say.

8e9ddf3d-2cdb-49a7-877e-70a40f10ae7d-0
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.715
So she thought about it for some time because she know there are

8e9ddf3d-2cdb-49a7-877e-70a40f10ae7d-1
00:28:39.715 --> 00:28:42.380
many gender issues going on in the country.

44e399e5-f546-4b18-9668-c3852b4c5685-0
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.980
Then she said both.

56e9d563-ea86-492a-a150-0d7566d01816-0
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.650
Then the boy went into some thinking.

932d16b1-d5b8-487e-b71c-cde06c091e82-0
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.345
After some time, he came back and asked Mama, is God, is God

932d16b1-d5b8-487e-b71c-cde06c091e82-1
00:28:58.345 --> 00:28:59.490
black or white?

45ccac8f-bb79-4b7f-8e46-3663a6b1a1c9-0
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:05.570
This is a serious issue in America, racial issues.

79384911-ddb2-4cae-a049-1491b59d83e3-0
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.010
So she thought about it, thought about it.

b2bceb5e-7eaf-46fb-8245-dcd679e8072f-0
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.610
She took an hour.

930a9524-2a7c-456b-b755-883a5fa4a1d8-0
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:16.120
Then she told him both Sadhguru, the boy went into deep thinking.

4fbe5cfc-bf03-4ed9-9f81-e96bfa5e3bc4-0
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:24.399
After much time, he came back and asked Momma, is God gay or

4fbe5cfc-bf03-4ed9-9f81-e96bfa5e3bc4-1
00:29:24.399 --> 00:29:25.320
straight?

9d53d1b3-05fe-431b-9e4f-6ee378f995da-0
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.335
She thought about all the associated issues and politics

9d53d1b3-05fe-431b-9e4f-6ee378f995da-1
00:29:31.335 --> 00:29:32.240
around that.

eea4e3e6-80d1-4ee7-94b0-19106c4d4be9-0
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.800
After some time, she said, both the boys jumped in joy.

9499c5ee-cde2-435d-ab5a-1c3135d36d3b-0
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.720
I got it.

9f521cf8-5f72-4cde-8045-0a83c41326ad-0
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.360
I got it.

03ddb788-57b4-4bed-b2fb-eb6c79c3d3f6-0
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.290
It's Michael Jackson, Sadhguru.

e2030852-f389-4f3c-9213-6cae1c9c59e9-0
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.970
I don't know how you arrived at yours.

a9efbbe5-61b2-4368-bb09-d36f7268e79f-0
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:53.529
I don't know how you made your conclusions, but something like

a9efbbe5-61b2-4368-bb09-d36f7268e79f-1
00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:53.850
this.

20fed0ad-0cbe-4993-9225-7ec2245dbeba-0
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:04.796
So I'm saying for this one day, whatever you think you know all

20fed0ad-0cbe-4993-9225-7ec2245dbeba-1
00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:05.370
that.

b4546e70-aafe-439f-bcd4-9c1a2302bd37-0
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.570
Can you keep it down about life?

9d617a0c-7f13-48b8-a62b-684983f581f4-0
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.850
Whatever you think you know what you know.

ded3190a-9d39-409f-8376-e9253d9523a9-0
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:12.490
By experience.

655c29f4-779c-49ec-87cf-da7bdd86fd06-0
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.210
We'll live that.

e077de3c-568f-4191-9693-c85c511a1550-0
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.900
I am not saying you must give it up for life, that's your choice.

bb5ac3b9-ef55-460f-976c-f1da71c66dfc-0
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.555
But for today, if you want this mechanism to work, if you want

bb5ac3b9-ef55-460f-976c-f1da71c66dfc-1
00:30:22.555 --> 00:30:26.861
this dimension to touch your life, it's important you give up

bb5ac3b9-ef55-460f-976c-f1da71c66dfc-2
00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:31.028
conclusions that you have made based on whatever influences

bb5ac3b9-ef55-460f-976c-f1da71c66dfc-3
00:30:31.028 --> 00:30:32.140
that you've had.

db0005af-cf2a-4d8d-b6b1-8074d770f81f-0
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:41.470
That means you don't sit here as a Tamil person, sadhguru.

53162a2d-cce7-42c1-9206-da76d7aa52dc-0
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.990
You don't sit here as a Hindu.

5ae72def-d2e3-4ed3-8125-29cf2f475055-0
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.830
You don't sit here as a Muslim.

e378bec6-8d56-45e6-a078-2bb92cf648c5-0
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.550
You don't sit here as a Maharashtra.

4ade1b9f-d5b8-483d-8b29-fb12e9f3e31f-0
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.910
I'm sorry, Marathi.

6bc5e679-e355-4005-88a2-bca9218eee41-0
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.950
You don't sit here as a Christian.

f3facdf5-6b44-40fe-a64b-fd265f4879cf-0
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.430
You don't sit here as Sikh.

de7b2cbf-2e76-4647-9355-9302fd66aa83-0
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.110
You don't sit here as that.

a58e9f46-a969-4b47-aba0-dae85114dc9c-0
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:02.990
You sit here as a life because this will only work for a life.

0a67b4d3-2e30-4501-b53c-1d7a646b878b-0
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.990
This doesn't work for all the other people that I mentioned.

69329b91-807b-4d01-bd1a-f117d534cccf-0
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.790
Not even as a man or a woman.

39c48163-ba83-4f78-a76a-7861afa35940-0
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.140
Because it will not work for men.

fbe202c2-88ad-4eaa-8a65-d45f81cecb05-0
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.917
Definitely not work for women, but it'll work for the life that

fbe202c2-88ad-4eaa-8a65-d45f81cecb05-1
00:31:15.917 --> 00:31:16.460
you are.

4a59699b-507e-414f-8e9d-676aaa8f3447-0
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.820
Can we can we do this for a few hours?

ac3f6548-6fb1-4df5-b5ea-a796deb5f246-0
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.140
Can we just be here like a life?

b5c6e1a2-80f3-4f63-8f0e-87cc5d532c57-0
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.980
Because that's what you are.

cbc5aa13-338a-4c2a-8e56-7e0f75451f76-0
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.300
If you don't understand this, we'll keep everything intact.

d2845e99-408d-4654-b1e7-4d4b9b7c3ba8-0
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.371
Your religion, your language, your all the other identities

d2845e99-408d-4654-b1e7-4d4b9b7c3ba8-1
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:35.420
will just take the lifeout of you.

bbc8171f-4301-401d-97ca-80ce77995d22-0
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.460
What does it mean?

5cd73c5e-4419-4698-8b78-f86618d17113-0
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:37.980
Hello.

d531dce9-a723-42fb-a623-9bba384dc453-0
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.690
Because there is life, we added some decoration.

1dd6d1cc-4b3c-471b-806c-ef8a4d57d2c3-0
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.410
Now decoration became so important we forgot we are life.

8c078e77-294e-4b5b-9e53-f4306b650399-0
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:55.921
This is the tragedy of human existence right now that ah, you

8c078e77-294e-4b5b-9e53-f4306b650399-1
00:31:55.921 --> 00:32:01.698
started decorating because you know you want to enhance this

8c078e77-294e-4b5b-9e53-f4306b650399-2
00:32:01.698 --> 00:32:02.930
life somehow.

ebdd96ca-a7ed-4b5d-b815-08c8a21fb5c9-0
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.970
Little more, little more little more.

77092da9-5124-4587-87f1-c382cc1d4262-0
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.170
Like frills and frills and frills and frills.

ed52ef5c-924b-4286-9987-b3365715b141-0
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.670
So many frills.

331934b8-d1f7-4733-be51-d486c5136fcd-0
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.110
Then you thought a skirt is not needed.

bd9105fb-86eb-4e34-93ed-63278108a85e-0
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:13.430
That's a tragedy.

8e32c89c-f9c9-4fc1-ac17-ca169b9f53b3-0
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.790
That's all that's happening to everybody right now.

79ae6719-02df-40b8-a4b1-caaf4c4a99ff-0
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.950
There are too many frills of life, Life forgotten.

43b63213-796c-45b2-a557-1bec5c352f20-0
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.244
If somebody says my life, you have to search, what are they

43b63213-796c-45b2-a557-1bec5c352f20-1
00:32:25.244 --> 00:32:26.190
talking about?

c8530a6b-f014-4479-b633-52a757248ef2-0
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.670
Are they talking about their family?

27fb9c1a-85ea-4107-b035-e5b4fbaa7e99-0
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.670
Are they talking about their career?

b933d150-9920-439c-9737-e2166413819c-0
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.470
Are they talking about their money?

8eca7f08-da88-4563-ba76-29eff5035028-0
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:37.136
Are they talking about their wealth, their car, their dog, or

8eca7f08-da88-4563-ba76-29eff5035028-1
00:32:37.136 --> 00:32:39.390
their favorite television show?

2371fb98-b596-4bb0-a779-b96dc4583c6b-0
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.510
What are they talking about?

16dc64c0-6ede-4a8f-9838-ae03a66bd7d6-0
00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.630
They're definitely not talking about the life that they are.

03fa5ab6-09db-4d53-8c0f-bb0ed1649a64-0
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.980
They are talking about all kinds of things which are not their

03fa5ab6-09db-4d53-8c0f-bb0ed1649a64-1
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.230
life.

297c1fde-ce67-4c27-b31a-65a0ed6f592b-0
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:57.150
This is life to give it a vehicle for this life.

75e88e17-3793-49e0-9517-b0b7b298373d-0
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:01.920
We built a body over a period of time to make this function

75e88e17-3793-49e0-9517-b0b7b298373d-1
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.950
intelligently.

3989a6ac-2504-4248-b031-808c11e18757-0
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.470
We built a mind and emotion around it.

1a635dbd-cb0e-4b15-a12d-8b08e648552f-0
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.060
We made it more to make it convenient.

a01edd25-891d-4e9c-b560-3bc174a51896-0
00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.700
We built a home to make it accessible.

1a3abf0b-48f3-4cbf-be69-be085cc9fb21-0
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:17.132
We got ourselves education, this, that many things,

1a3abf0b-48f3-4cbf-be69-be085cc9fb21-1
00:33:17.132 --> 00:33:21.991
everything to facilitate this life to happen in the best

1a3abf0b-48f3-4cbf-be69-be085cc9fb21-2
00:33:21.991 --> 00:33:23.100
possible way.

f95c7229-c214-48f5-9e33-886e8cb57727-0
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.150
That is the idea behind all these things, whether it's your

f95c7229-c214-48f5-9e33-886e8cb57727-1
00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.128
education or your marriage or your children or any damn thing

f95c7229-c214-48f5-9e33-886e8cb57727-2
00:33:32.128 --> 00:33:35.529
that you're doing, is essentially to facilitate this

f95c7229-c214-48f5-9e33-886e8cb57727-3
00:33:35.529 --> 00:33:37.070
life so that it happens.

257a1245-9c60-4334-9a1f-3fba3cbb4d6d-0
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:43.110
Well, now people are getting buried under their frills.

78cb4501-bc04-423d-b674-db0ab2b3d855-0
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:44.750
They can't breathe.

4a9709c8-122e-41ae-b99e-1b2e993ad9ab-0
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.950
They try to build a house.

26325847-94be-4661-b177-8faa101b338c-0
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.190
Now they have a warehouse.

ecf42621-0da0-4aba-8c67-6747a0c3558e-0
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.388
They built a house because they want to live well, but now they

ecf42621-0da0-4aba-8c67-6747a0c3558e-1
00:33:55.388 --> 00:33:56.270
have a warehouse.

a9f2cf12-5782-4615-ba1f-e7840a66b392-0
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.430
It's suffocating them.

13887150-9316-4608-9af4-8df4eaedcc0b-0
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.310
They built a carrier because they want to live well.

545c2d0c-7a08-42db-a4f0-409fbde46296-0
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.630
Now it is taking the lifeout of them.

fe1ef847-9ea7-4555-8e11-a71d78d8d7bb-0
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.300
This is simply because we have forgotten what is life.

cb196ee0-d5d6-4694-9caa-bf211f2251af-0
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.815
This one day I want you to be with me, just as a throbbing

cb196ee0-d5d6-4694-9caa-bf211f2251af-1
00:34:13.815 --> 00:34:15.100
living life.

4edb011d-aa91-45c8-b960-59f8d47cd420-0
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.020
Then it's very easy.

37500197-ed71-4614-bf5e-de3a9d69a33c-0
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.860
The last seven sessions.

c391d62e-8e12-4a59-9045-2308f6aaddfd-0
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:25.531
This is what we've been trying to do with you, because what you

c391d62e-8e12-4a59-9045-2308f6aaddfd-1
00:34:25.531 --> 00:34:29.100
call as myself right now is a restriction.

a8ea9e0c-6a99-44c5-8111-e34f98eb069b-0
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.200
Right now, it's not so much in India, it's beginning to happen.

192d1595-da26-469d-8175-d683946dc10c-0
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.840
People, of course, copy everything.

a155e60b-25c8-42fb-b8b4-58ee21ed2f42-0
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.480
It's beginning to happen.

03d50f31-c529-460d-b8e2-b6ae9f92741d-0
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.120
But in the Western countries, I'm a morning person.

7ca67900-3845-4d31-9bcf-1c829e98883f-0
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.560
I'm a evening person.

56b358c5-ef35-41f5-ba42-b76453f9da0f-0
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.480
What does it mean?

0ad82865-fbc5-4595-b786-b1214e93a095-0
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.160
Either either you're dead in the evening or in the morning.

639b934b-3df1-4784-a048-20f88f0d1164-0
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.360
Tell me, which way is it?

f7c791b1-4013-4c16-9eda-03a55ad0c2b5-0
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:50.640
Hello.

50b6d14b-2e29-45b7-927f-057e0a0677cb-0
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.400
Oh, it's getting worse.

9b7799d2-4dae-4f85-b0b4-d2477ebaf2bb-0
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.840
I'm a coffee person.

74c80cca-e24d-4919-b116-0ec368eca2ed-0
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.750
I'm a tea person, of course.

1df801c0-03c1-472c-89e8-8ff401f3d0f9-0
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:58.950
There are political parties.

ed88968c-3331-47b6-bec5-fe1939895cc4-0
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.790
I'm a Republican.

de2f950a-4953-45d0-b914-b2c0c62c9cb3-0
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.510
I'm a Democrat.

c18af311-4665-4d77-a373-4a15100f6b89-0
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.870
I'm this, I'm that TCH.

2796e50a-c1ba-4a18-97a1-9fe6a46e5a9a-0
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:09.190
Identities that you're taking on are just a way of constricting

2796e50a-c1ba-4a18-97a1-9fe6a46e5a9a-1
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.910
yourself.

45b28c2d-116d-4871-9ccb-8ea0f1027dfe-0
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:14.683
Identities are only needed to function in the world for

45b28c2d-116d-4871-9ccb-8ea0f1027dfe-1
00:35:14.683 --> 00:35:15.950
functional reasons.

7ca92ae7-6cc4-4512-858c-0ed6f765d128-0
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.350
We take up some identity.

37b56c49-e69a-4696-a416-c109eb266032-0
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.030
But for life to happen, you don't need any identity.

fd808858-ba69-4b1b-8ee9-8b1ca184f62b-0
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.030
For life to throb within you, do you need an identity?

288f9e9f-8fe9-45a6-9cb5-3a8309c01be1-0
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:27.430
Before you go to sleep?

e08839c9-d0ed-4e9c-a8d5-60cb4b85b132-0
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:32.118
Do you have to tell yourself I'm either your nationality or your

e08839c9-d0ed-4e9c-a8d5-60cb4b85b132-1
00:35:32.118 --> 00:35:33.950
religion or your something?

51df8655-cc33-4ff3-9b03-b72e3557e5d3-0
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:34.790
I'm a Hindu.

d04f616c-7fa3-4fb6-bacf-5cb3a26ad560-0
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.310
I'm a Hindu.

a481c1eb-447f-41ac-9c4a-d9a097103a26-0
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:35.910
I'm a Hindu.

efee5c43-303a-4d51-964d-54c4ab6388ec-0
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:37.790
Please, when I wake up, let my be.

84687c53-c010-4f60-9d6d-0185f0f030d3-0
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:38.830
Let me be a Hindu.

56a9fb1c-6364-4db8-9140-3828895088c5-0
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.830
Is it necessary?

b487a588-a10f-41e7-b436-a696dacce9f0-0
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:40.510
I'm asking.

8f0197b0-7ea9-4094-9915-b4c5592d635d-0
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.910
This is an identity to live in a society.

26e064d4-d038-4169-8eda-4285f52854b9-0
00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.230
If it's necessary, you can keep it.

c6d71dc6-9e6a-4a39-8077-c7ec8610f852-0
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.150
If it's not necessary, you can keep it aside.

de6667c2-a9e1-4532-9779-43512392a91e-0
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:52.915
But no, no, you carry this all the time, whether it's of

de6667c2-a9e1-4532-9779-43512392a91e-1
00:35:52.915 --> 00:35:55.690
religion, nationality, family, education.

5afcd1d8-88c9-4084-b163-e91cf5e1e166-0
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.410
Oh, it doesn't stop with that.

8eb29f46-ab93-4c7c-93e3-b6918de6dc04-0
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.490
It goes on South.

64d39f88-7f6d-4c77-8209-16e57b626ae8-0
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:04.706
What you're calling as myself in this vast cosmos is a

64d39f88-7f6d-4c77-8209-16e57b626ae8-1
00:36:04.706 --> 00:36:06.010
constricted idea.

14214e5c-5460-422c-ab5d-0045871a47eb-0
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.410
That is, you want this life to happen in limited ways.

5c3acf17-efba-4381-b352-9ff2ff6069a3-0
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:17.170
Why such a problem came is because the fear of suffering.

cbe0971d-1912-47c0-b3ab-fd914e9ed773-0
00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:21.490
Last time you stepped out, somebody poked you a little bit.

575bca32-3918-4c6a-84c0-70dcefe081e5-0
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:28.754
So now so you create more and more walls around yourself

575bca32-3918-4c6a-84c0-70dcefe081e5-1
00:36:28.754 --> 00:36:32.920
because you think walls are safety.

90f56625-b3e5-4227-be10-198817a131b3-0
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.755
Yes, it is true when there's an external attack, a wall is

90f56625-b3e5-4227-be10-198817a131b3-1
00:36:38.755 --> 00:36:43.591
safety, but a wall that you build for self preservation is

90f56625-b3e5-4227-be10-198817a131b3-2
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:48.754
also the wall which will self imprison you unless you know how

90f56625-b3e5-4227-be10-198817a131b3-3
00:36:48.754 --> 00:36:54.000
to put it up when it's necessary and pull it down when it's not

90f56625-b3e5-4227-be10-198817a131b3-4
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.820
necessary.

18ff339f-f51c-40eb-9bf3-bc3d3f54c053-0
00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.140
If you do not know this, if your walls are not flexible that they

18ff339f-f51c-40eb-9bf3-bc3d3f54c053-1
00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.386
can come up when it is needed and it'll go down when it's not

18ff339f-f51c-40eb-9bf3-bc3d3f54c053-2
00:37:04.386 --> 00:37:08.564
needed, If this freedom is not there with you, you will be a

18ff339f-f51c-40eb-9bf3-bc3d3f54c053-3
00:37:08.564 --> 00:37:10.140
self imprisoned person.

46289514-3fb8-4d1f-b503-4e81d9314de1-0
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.580
That's all that's happened.

7947ad7a-a5bb-4663-96e6-4452c2b23581-0
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:20.798
So Sadhguru, even if you're imprisoned, you know in a real

7947ad7a-a5bb-4663-96e6-4452c2b23581-1
00:37:20.798 --> 00:37:23.840
prison this is also real.

2060e40d-27c0-4f26-9bfb-0718f5614d98-0
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.080
I'm not saying this is not real.

c30af663-ac89-46ee-8f65-42034e96bcaf-0
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.440
This is also real.

5af3f1b0-97be-4734-8223-70bc7d79efb2-0
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.000
Only you generally need some outside help.

b0e154fe-4d26-48e6-9cf4-7c1dbb30ee40-0
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.880
That is why Shambhavi little outside help.

9fff804a-e62e-4014-ab45-4b7dc473ac2a-0
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.270
If a person from outside enters the prison, he knows how to help

9fff804a-e62e-4014-ab45-4b7dc473ac2a-1
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.840
you out.

05ff7c29-5f5a-41c4-9328-bf3f7e4254e9-0
00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.802
But inside, if you've lived in the prison forever, you have no

05ff7c29-5f5a-41c4-9328-bf3f7e4254e9-1
00:37:46.802 --> 00:37:48.160
idea how to get outside.

4c8d03bb-0c03-486f-965a-d806b85dc048-0
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.820
So we are not going to do anything.

7c2fd610-99df-4852-b250-240640cf6df4-0
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.660
We will make sure a key drops to you from the top.

a27d0b50-8cb1-4b07-945f-ac2aa2c84028-0
00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.933
Or are you sensible enough that we can give it to you and you

a27d0b50-8cb1-4b07-945f-ac2aa2c84028-1
00:38:01.933 --> 00:38:05.220
will work on it and making it make it into a working key.

31743a22-4a31-44c7-adca-835c1d3bf788-0
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.660
Which way are you or you wanted to?

026232dd-3dc7-40fd-a605-76eca8cc55d8-0
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.949
I should create something, keep it on the ceiling fan and turn

026232dd-3dc7-40fd-a605-76eca8cc55d8-1
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:13.620
it and see it came from the sky.

1a25097e-00bb-4565-9fff-66207b172ddd-0
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.822
Or can I straight forward hand it over to you and tell you you

1a25097e-00bb-4565-9fff-66207b172ddd-1
00:38:17.822 --> 00:38:21.662
must take care of this key This way if you do it like this, this

1a25097e-00bb-4565-9fff-66207b172ddd-2
00:38:21.662 --> 00:38:22.490
key will work.

0ac4ef9b-57c4-4767-8a7e-b76d03102e68-0
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:25.949
Are you sensible enough for that or should I keep it on the fan

0ac4ef9b-57c4-4767-8a7e-b76d03102e68-1
00:38:25.949 --> 00:38:27.290
and make it drop in the night?

3c714751-0b54-4f7b-ab07-0ff3468e46d3-0
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:34.471
No, please tell me because unfortunately a large number of

3c714751-0b54-4f7b-ab07-0ff3468e46d3-1
00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:38.170
people are still in those conditions.

140e00e7-7a41-40e6-b6ec-9bfdbba66c2f-0
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:43.907
So these last seven sessions that you've been through has

140e00e7-7a41-40e6-b6ec-9bfdbba66c2f-1
00:38:43.907 --> 00:38:49.226
been just this, that somehow to at least give you a sense of

140e00e7-7a41-40e6-b6ec-9bfdbba66c2f-2
00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:53.935
knowing that you're you're unnecessarily constricting

140e00e7-7a41-40e6-b6ec-9bfdbba66c2f-3
00:38:53.935 --> 00:38:54.719
yourself.

d2793dd3-a299-407c-baed-483897a4078d-0
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.108
And if you wish, if you're willing, you can easily step out

d2793dd3-a299-407c-baed-483897a4078d-1
00:38:58.108 --> 00:38:58.560
of that.

d0ecf935-4f8b-4b91-9247-d48365e583f3-0
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.592
Your ability to respond, I'm asking you again, is it limited

d0ecf935-4f8b-4b91-9247-d48365e583f3-1
00:39:05.592 --> 00:39:06.640
or unlimited?

221fbe41-08eb-4a6d-900a-f7ddc20f6918-0
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.520
Your ability to respond is limitless.

f19760cd-df81-40c7-9441-25bee1c7c168-0
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.400
Your ability to act, is it limited or unlimited?

4e9efcba-52c1-4d86-bf56-1327d9ebe43b-0
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.160
It's limited.

95a779c3-2d3f-4257-9a69-8f788712fc80-0
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.190
This is all you need to understand.

3a2dd86f-b863-4109-9699-ddee249a9745-0
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.070
Because you misunderstand responsibility.

01a46e9f-05d2-4c8a-ac76-cdae9b3348d4-0
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.910
As action, you limit your responsibility.

3fc677ee-c992-4d14-a98f-71b34b03a24b-0
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.230
Action is limited.

9a0876ac-6a08-4ecb-857f-d43f72fdfbf9-0
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.590
Why?

8dea5608-0373-496f-acd7-8d50e8c90c8a-0
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.790
Action needs a prescription?

bf5dbf5e-cded-45ed-90db-887b961ef63c-0
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.750
How much energy?

89dd57f8-04ea-47e0-a76a-cf9207e34224-0
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:32.790
How much intelligence?

c97af359-5879-434c-8656-a23249a34aee-0
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.870
What situation?

dc73d23e-1471-41cd-a408-3739f39b4b32-0
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.710
Will the situation allow it or not?

a1fdbb7d-f9a7-40c5-a077-a1c88bde7726-0
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.790
What times are we living?

0e4b9cd7-da19-43d7-97ed-75e1a4db4f7d-0
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.150
Living in variety of things.

cf572669-632b-4d02-91f5-a83644c21786-0
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.830
Prescribe our action, isn't it?

1423c324-12b9-4cfd-a80d-36045d637caa-0
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.950
Action is always to prescription.

a4c0f98d-aafb-4d35-b08a-6bdf57d475de-0
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.930
Sadhguru ability to respond is the nature of life.

b5bec855-4b68-4e27-a05d-f41583899610-0
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.290
It anyway responds willingly or unwillingly is the only

b5bec855-4b68-4e27-a05d-f41583899610-1
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:55.010
question.

e06dd40a-b209-43b1-ad5d-391bfb116ff7-0
00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:01.570
If you respond willingly, TCH, life will be fantastic.

6c835249-3e03-4954-873b-cb851daffbb8-0
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.210
If you respond unwillingly, life will be miserable.

344b19e1-7ff3-41a0-be71-b2c5c4cc26c8-0
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:07.690
This is all it is.

eb0f0d93-6a58-4c5a-bbb2-3bd0a0f4c7d3-0
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.930
We've gone through this already.

3f1ad51f-ec1b-43d9-9aa3-b3c92a180aab-0
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:13.530
I'm reminding you, anything that you do willingly is your heaven.

c2c7d703-0291-4d25-8f2d-5612aa1dd3a3-0
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:15.750
Sadhguru, the same thing.

da60c218-26b9-47ad-9367-893e20369cf5-0
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.910
If you do it unwillingly, it's your hell.

cf7a6a44-1dbe-4d5a-aec0-a0b7a004fadb-0
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.110
This is a choice that you have to make.

163a10ae-77eb-4406-a042-1f6cf1d3108b-0
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:27.658
This is a choice that you have to make that do I want to live

163a10ae-77eb-4406-a042-1f6cf1d3108b-1
00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:31.590
blissfully or do I want lots of suffering?

0656a5f3-1701-4c47-a623-2711e7ad9947-0
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.919
Why I'm asking such a silly question to you is a whole lot

0656a5f3-1701-4c47-a623-2711e7ad9947-1
00:40:35.919 --> 00:40:38.950
of people have woven philosophies around misery.

87e69c36-efcb-49eb-a6a3-55e9fa50efae-0
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:48.270
How misery curates you into higher level of whatever.

10214a58-ce6b-4f81-99e5-1548886b928e-0
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.190
All the best for you.

c06a2ea2-cfdc-4c16-8b0e-5e54fdf62dc3-0
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.470
I have nothing to do with you.

54cf2bf6-3435-48d7-85f7-4dbf5ffd9879-0
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:57.954
Because if you think misery is what makes a man or a woman

54cf2bf6-3435-48d7-85f7-4dbf5ffd9879-1
00:40:57.954 --> 00:41:00.670
mature, all the best for you.

6b473bd1-bb1f-4f1a-90ab-667d38404f9e-0
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.470
What you're saying is you're such a donkey.

202b117c-903d-4bd8-81ed-cdd91eb4bf46-0
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.550
Unless you're beaten, you will not understand.

410cec03-40ca-48f0-9beb-10b8e29d6006-0
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.030
Suffering means life is beating you up, isn't it?

600716c3-f88d-4101-99c9-0b49ebcc7e6f-0
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.870
Hello.

bd181a50-d01f-4cc2-b407-b6c694935176-0
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.950
Hello.

b4a04428-ed7d-4183-a709-580dfdab3191-0
00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.980
Suffering essentially means life is beating you up inside out.

b979bdab-eb21-44e4-b7e1-e53abf2ad53d-0
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.460
So if you say without beating, no human being will mature.

d154a94b-8364-4c72-b66a-b7c2e188a590-0
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.060
I think there's an evolutionary problem here.

ea26b9de-50eb-46c3-9368-89e1f2bd43c8-0
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.660
Yes, this is a little bit of a evolutionary problem.

843aca5f-233c-48be-8aac-935efac69b14-0
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:38.340
Still, the donkey Ness is not gone unless beaten, won't move.

9d49040b-103e-4524-a32e-e7a8713aa700-0
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.100
No, no, it's time.

4595f0a9-1ec2-4ad0-9989-4781ddc29774-0
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.180
Evolution has reasonably happened to all of you.

19367a07-7927-4d54-ab2b-df19bfd3a07f-0
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.675
Believe me by looking at you, I'm saying I don't see ears

19367a07-7927-4d54-ab2b-df19bfd3a07f-1
00:41:48.675 --> 00:41:50.380
standing up like this.

f70acdc0-9363-4c6f-bf89-2b14e6ff025c-0
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.540
I don't see a tail.

9e9107b5-a020-4bdd-934e-034e4e1ed2bc-0
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.860
I don't see the fur on your body.

f79fc407-7667-41ed-a8b6-c8b4fc8b7083-0
00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:02.166
So evolution has happened, just the old habits are still going

f79fc407-7667-41ed-a8b6-c8b4fc8b7083-1
00:42:02.166 --> 00:42:03.540
on in yoga.

3de61daa-6999-44ad-9d79-f33ff81080e8-0
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:09.227
The classic example that is given always to human condition

3de61daa-6999-44ad-9d79-f33ff81080e8-1
00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:14.318
is it is like a bird lived in a cage for a long time, but now

3de61daa-6999-44ad-9d79-f33ff81080e8-2
00:42:14.318 --> 00:42:19.409
the door is blown away, but the bird won't fly because it got

3de61daa-6999-44ad-9d79-f33ff81080e8-3
00:42:19.409 --> 00:42:20.969
used to not flying.

62a192db-9d26-4527-8773-d82a9efe19ad-0
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.330
Now there are people weaving philosophies.

91442419-ba97-44aa-b065-c75d80da2cdd-0
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.650
Flying is dangerous.

183d5e5e-6fca-4f3e-8d82-004bba29f90d-0
00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:29.450
Did you see how recently this airplane crashed that happened?

9098e60a-1cd3-4f74-a56e-943de316b5d9-0
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.850
Flying is very dangerous.

fd421761-ea4a-4d9f-95d6-2bb7e125bf42-0
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:36.690
So it's time humanity walks full stride.

6abf5687-c849-4267-ad6e-20e228a42c60-0
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.530
It's very, very important.

563148d3-6c5a-46b4-9c90-6446619924ea-0
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:43.420
I'm oh, I'm talking about you when I say humanity should walk.

48fd3a02-8d07-4386-af2b-215c1f8b837b-0
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.300
Yes, sadhguru, they must all walk.

6fc05fce-b6b5-451d-93d4-9567f2b8ac41-0
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.620
No, I'm talking about you.

b015c5bb-6ec1-4965-aea0-7fe2dc0b1372-0
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.860
I'm not talking about them.

ab9e78bf-aaf1-4d6b-9283-b7936998280d-0
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:56.742
You should learn to walk full stride, because this is a brief

ab9e78bf-aaf1-4d6b-9283-b7936998280d-1
00:42:56.742 --> 00:42:57.820
life here.

a1fc4ec1-73a9-4038-8ddd-4968c97c1dd0-0
00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.860
What are you holding back?

2c89cc60-f4d4-4dc2-a5d6-a0b3cb05a8a0-0
00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.860
If you hold back, will you live longer?

f3cbbbfd-e078-48b9-b6c6-fa57c8679bcf-0
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.980
I'm asking hello.

9dc1aad8-8857-42b7-8bca-612e484e2f69-0
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.020
If you hold back, will you live forever?

5c33a730-42dc-4168-a073-8b22d7f74009-0
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.009
In case somebody has told you such a philosophy, I'm telling

5c33a730-42dc-4168-a073-8b22d7f74009-1
00:43:11.009 --> 00:43:12.570
you that's not going to happen.

77c6e544-371a-410e-bd98-06e7191e61d0-0
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:17.330
If you hold back, probably you will die sooner out of boredom.

c9d7a4b5-283c-46a8-9730-c4b7bc959aca-0
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.490
So there is no holding back life.

05fa4f0b-10c9-49f0-957e-ec384a905681-0
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:28.503
The only way life can happen is full on, whether it's an insect,

05fa4f0b-10c9-49f0-957e-ec384a905681-1
00:43:28.503 --> 00:43:32.250
worm, plant, animal, bird or a human being.

61af96d1-ae03-42a7-80c6-b3570b8154f3-0
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.730
The only way life can happen is full on.

2e10c595-2da3-44b1-873e-72198fb52a68-0
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.970
That's the only way it happens.

a4b298a8-b5ec-45b0-8a88-2d33efa67fd8-0
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:43.768
Otherwise, if there is a mango tree here which has never borne,

a4b298a8-b5ec-45b0-8a88-2d33efa67fd8-1
00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:48.744
not just fruit, even a flower, then after some time nobody

a4b298a8-b5ec-45b0-8a88-2d33efa67fd8-2
00:43:48.744 --> 00:43:50.600
calls it a mango tree.

db2cc03d-6513-405c-800e-3a3d6f91e249-0
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.360
It'll become like that.

3e5615a9-9db1-46fb-a6ec-b8d765491d46-0
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.640
Only if it bears fruit, it becomes a mango tree, isn't it?

d5fd1c31-b2bb-4faa-a723-ab9759a8f06d-0
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.080
So?

29dc5240-8cb8-480e-b5f0-9f6baa6ec49d-0
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.796
Only if you become full on, blossom into a full-fledged

29dc5240-8cb8-480e-b5f0-9f6baa6ec49d-1
00:44:01.796 --> 00:44:03.920
life, then you're a human being.

f7539853-73ee-4cf9-b295-fe43a4371b0b-0
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.440
Otherwise you're a seed.

303e51bc-e05a-4ee0-868b-5bf82d19c86e-0
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.543
Hello, if I show you a mango seed and say see mango tree,

303e51bc-e05a-4ee0-868b-5bf82d19c86e-1
00:44:13.543 --> 00:44:15.550
well you say rubbish.

7af60e08-e660-4390-8f81-e2ffb0d9a40c-0
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:16.430
That's just a seed.

6e5885af-7be8-4b0c-82e0-7f8847c99335-0
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.990
That's all I'm saying.

e65abc76-c75e-4689-a00c-da0a366e6ff9-0
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:23.140
So if you see a human being who's refused to grow because of

e65abc76-c75e-4689-a00c-da0a366e6ff9-1
00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.390
the fear of growth, then what will happen?

8fb8c061-5877-442f-bf25-147b8f7b764b-0
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.280
Yes, if you grow into a full-fledged mango tree, people

8fb8c061-5877-442f-bf25-147b8f7b764b-1
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.750
will throw stones at you.

eedf3837-9685-4c40-ae90-72e25ad094a8-0
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:36.038
TCH, if you're full of fruit, lot of people will throw stones

eedf3837-9685-4c40-ae90-72e25ad094a8-1
00:44:36.038 --> 00:44:36.550
at me.

4372ea6b-5d69-4330-bfea-bb86fb86d33a-0
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.950
Always.

d0f66e62-1661-4e94-92b0-71cd3aa0a3c5-0
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.870
They're throwing at me.

6ec1f907-b1a8-4aab-becd-407c82ba1a9f-0
00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:46.770
Yes or no, Monkeys will gonna come and jump all over you.

7c1c23f6-2672-45c1-8607-5c146862f76f-0
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.370
All kinds of things will happen.

45e11c1c-dd61-4ae1-ab2d-9288ca295a3d-0
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:55.650
But the important thing is you are a full-fledged mango tree.

6ab824be-0a89-47a5-88c6-7bd49544917c-0
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.250
That is the important thing.

ef94e2dc-9e6c-4a3f-aff8-c2d8b6dfcce6-0
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:58.090
Yes or no.

1a7350fe-dc56-4cc5-92d4-6f651156ef99-0
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:04.460
But if you are just a seed, we can lock you up in a safe and

1a7350fe-dc56-4cc5-92d4-6f651156ef99-1
00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.210
you are safe wherever.

6ea599eb-5024-43cf-85b9-73d995b05cb7-0
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:08.810
But that's not life.

6670b4e7-b73a-456b-9979-57330ddc2814-0
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.560
If you do not allow life to happen, it seems to be safe.

145042b9-64d2-41b5-9f5b-54e9b39c327c-0
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.720
What is the point of that safety?

a5a32f9d-66f5-438e-be99-b6e62589512c-0
00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.720
What you are saying is I want to live in my coffin right now.

e4164341-933f-409b-8b9b-257e0a996b18-0
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.800
Ah, that time will come.

11823a20-bfc1-4436-9c85-b1b721b3b6cb-0
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:24.720
Hello.

61b1ff07-dc0a-410c-882c-b3eda8eadf7f-0
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.440
Don't be anxious.

24bd8278-bc08-4962-9380-06b7e7e5eb69-0
00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.800
That will anyway come.

2867bfe3-cab4-4b3e-a12d-ea407cf01676-0
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.320
This is not the time.

d4be5a13-ed27-4465-8272-87c5a9617545-0
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.800
So ability to respond means it's your ability to live.

86476319-a0b6-4b81-b9cc-b74417749de3-0
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.880
The only way you can live is by responding.

87ab13b2-ba2b-4ecd-b7e9-31b0c2d03027-0
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.700
Sadhguru know you're miles away from me.

4c0c2611-bd3b-47d1-93ac-3939706f0b22-0
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.660
Will you respond?

b52a2e06-4e99-45ca-968b-1c91d6a140da-0
00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.260
He, he, he.

cf910348-5595-4676-9479-b6e5fb4ab47f-0
00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.060
At least you will do.

1d8c1441-528b-4699-8a56-1164fee3cbbd-0
00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.460
I'll wait for 25 seconds.

d7036cce-a6da-40e8-94dd-e659d1c5565e-0
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.300
Bad world, huh?

9a1653e5-93d5-42b6-855f-e858af78881e-0
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.431
If you smile at somebody, you have to wait for 25 seconds to

9a1653e5-93d5-42b6-855f-e858af78881e-1
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:00.620
get back their smile.

96a4db22-f5da-4b2d-8507-5fda709cccde-0
00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.547
This looks like a domestic situation where things have gone

96a4db22-f5da-4b2d-8507-5fda709cccde-1
00:46:03.547 --> 00:46:03.820
wrong.

54c8beb1-ea7a-40e3-b794-0142937d7eb9-0
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.890
Your ability to respond is vital.

449ee2e6-7701-4e39-80d1-6de4a892d4bc-0
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:17.690
If you give it up, the vital signs of life will start

449ee2e6-7701-4e39-80d1-6de4a892d4bc-1
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:18.290
receding.

dae5e1b0-865e-4bec-860b-d264c2ecaabd-0
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:25.100
If you lose your ability to respond slowly, you become less

dae5e1b0-865e-4bec-860b-d264c2ecaabd-1
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.890
and less and less alive by the moment.

a60cbaf2-a40b-46ca-8af0-4afe14529227-0
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:38.885
This dimension of seeing that my ability to respond is limitless

a60cbaf2-a40b-46ca-8af0-4afe14529227-1
00:46:38.885 --> 00:46:44.810
intellectually is fine, but are you actually responding?

95feab29-f5be-4854-913e-6f21cfa99e5e-0
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:51.370
Are you a little more response to life around you than what you

95feab29-f5be-4854-913e-6f21cfa99e5e-1
00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:52.970
were a few days ago?

cc0a5a8e-4f08-4132-b588-449522a3fe16-0
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.330
This is something you must evaluate.

855ce630-b0b8-4648-a1ad-3d5d36787520-0
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.290
You must evaluate every day.

12e28a32-016a-4252-8d1e-ab2ff31676b0-0
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:05.120
If you are a little, not a quick learner.

fa1160cd-446b-4cb5-8dfe-cafed8fd5418-0
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.480
You must evaluate every hour.

34291454-38a3-4b9c-b772-7cd0eb4a7e6d-0
00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.680
This hour.

76d77326-963d-46c0-ac68-1b6a6e483b78-0
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:10.520
Ha.

7377225b-9dfb-4686-8a8a-8c1e09aa1be1-0
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.840
Am I responding?

6f91015c-04a3-4e8d-8d57-e0c4d2a71608-0
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.760
Am I alive?

998f69d1-7dcb-4d33-b7c5-b844f3c7cbea-0
00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.480
You must check because one day you will be dead.

0a7b5ed5-b507-4b44-8dca-063f1c8e3666-0
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.160
I want you to know you don't have to practice.

47d505cc-5e18-4e2b-a1eb-da276381289d-0
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:18.880
From now on.

226cadb9-9541-4707-a0ed-33cb5cff2d1b-0
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.600
It will happen for sure.

91ddeddb-b61f-4b9b-80e3-6bf00f91973c-0
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:21.840
Hello.

d14164ec-29e8-43e3-aeb6-fa34b386c184-0
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.600
You think if you don't practice death, it won't come to you.

039d080f-e6f3-4931-8e11-9c8761fad321-0
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.080
It will come.

ec9a5a60-cea1-4ecf-b247-6af357f9cca2-0
00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.280
Believe me.

0c70d041-c095-4252-8488-04170f127071-0
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:29.760
Hello.

efd579f2-6c3f-4f08-ac13-9f2f637f942c-0
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.000
Believe me, it will come.

ebaea5b9-85bc-45fe-9b36-ea3f2cd7b6e8-0
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.140
Don't have to practice now.

46c0f1dd-7f4b-4214-9a39-b79bb7d47a30-0
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.580
What is assured 100%.

5c7290bd-afc1-40e4-81ae-c20446253d4d-0
00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.380
You don't have to practice for that.

f9a3f8b8-4b5b-43b6-acdf-c21af38c502a-0
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:38.940
Isn't it?

ba4ac7cc-d80e-4373-bed0-880cce90ac26-0
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.540
Nothing in life is assured.

b90532f5-5335-4e18-80ee-63e96972fcec-0
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.900
So this you must practice.

8823097e-6731-44e7-8f8e-4fe3db6e96e4-0
00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.580
Death is 100% assured.

60e93e1d-b130-4b13-9c00-0c2596752764-0
00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:50.780
Assured you don't have to practice it now.

b6ebc0b2-8eec-4e28-b9ab-5c5bec313815-0
00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.820
It will come.

203b7888-dbc0-47ef-a626-fc0a452d9ca1-0
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.140
If you're worried.

eaf9ab79-0d4a-48bc-8dbe-b1678f00ebac-0
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.700
Will I have the right pose when I die?

d012558d-1f53-421d-8da5-870a8610643e-0
00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:57.460
Believe me, you will get it.

afaf47d4-5755-4603-adb4-7080febeb40e-0
00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.620
You're a natural.

cf6f72d3-b427-490e-bddb-b72d8b27afae-0
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:02.490
Yes.

eeb96885-0c3d-4fbf-a507-5051031afb3d-0
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:07.610
You think you'll die like now.

119d05ac-180f-462f-acc1-39fff63fb377-0
00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:11.570
You will die properly in a very serious dignified way.

526369a8-0d64-40ad-84d5-9d2355873066-0
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.210
Don't worry about it.

b6a431c2-a5ba-4092-a800-4257cfea2f97-0
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.921
At least when you're dead we don't know how you will go

b6a431c2-a5ba-4092-a800-4257cfea2f97-1
00:48:15.921 --> 00:48:16.890
through the process.

309afe8b-8458-4e97-9f2c-bd8af292a7f0-0
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.253
Well if you keep sambhavi living within you, you will go through

309afe8b-8458-4e97-9f2c-bd8af292a7f0-1
00:48:21.253 --> 00:48:22.290
the process also.

318397f2-bec4-418e-8b20-72de93555bcb-0
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.250
Well, I'm talking about post death.

e1c7ea03-a608-4385-97d7-f220a4eef317-0
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:29.750
Don't be worried anyway if you have a wrong no.

6cc8549f-64e4-4d46-9c95-1e5425d28d14-0
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.910
Suppose you have a big grin on your face.

5b186731-ad0e-4304-b367-fa6082d1ae04-0
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:37.948
I'm sure the undertakers will beat it into shape and make it

5b186731-ad0e-4304-b367-fa6082d1ae04-1
00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:38.310
yes.

11c5196f-7524-4da4-a242-4ce1d4ed46da-0
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.270
So don't practice that now.

d0f2d38e-8d65-4cbc-97ef-da23942bd61d-0
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:43.990
What does this mean?

cb501492-85b7-4e61-a783-31451bf26ae5-0
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.790
Is this just about smiling?

95f3d31a-4ee3-4379-bea0-bc31d4d976a0-0
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.630
Is this about just being joyful?

7aad6289-6054-4b41-beca-3a152bc2ab4c-0
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.430
Is this just being having fun?

bafd6e91-cf7f-4efa-8cee-e70fe59b4bb8-0
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:50.510
No.

7303b87c-e088-41ba-b952-56df4ef5bb7c-0
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:55.294
You must understand if you create an ambience within you,

7303b87c-e088-41ba-b952-56df4ef5bb7c-1
00:48:55.294 --> 00:49:00.187
which is an assured ambience, that you will be always pleasant

7303b87c-e088-41ba-b952-56df4ef5bb7c-2
00:49:00.187 --> 00:49:01.429
within yourself.

28c57722-f497-45c7-bbab-117354fce7b3-0
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:06.790
Now all the possibilities of life will become possible.

41d5abc1-652d-47bb-88c1-3be00728e7e7-0
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:11.978
When you're worried about your basic experience of life, you

41d5abc1-652d-47bb-88c1-3be00728e7e7-1
00:49:11.978 --> 00:49:14.310
will not explore anything else.

c69c2d13-5920-481d-8c2f-5b68f93499cb-0
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.590
This is not about just being blissful.

4f16be14-5c06-417b-83ed-3d2ed6df5aef-0
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.110
This is about liberation.

9e8907e1-a16e-4c66-989e-01b0e15caf6e-0
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:22.847
This is about reaching the very peak of what is possible in

9e8907e1-a16e-4c66-989e-01b0e15caf6e-1
00:49:22.847 --> 00:49:23.430
human life.

37f164b4-ed84-4668-8df5-2b16efc6dda8-0
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:27.000
But for this you need an ambience, sadhguru.

359fa07f-0910-490f-85e9-1fffe5f60cec-0
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.520
Only when you're happy, you're willing to explore many things.

5d13b626-c664-4d35-98e3-93adff078fdd-0
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.760
Isn't it very unhappy?

f21bccff-a491-40d1-897c-9a71faa986f2-0
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.994
You don't even want to be touched by people that you know

f21bccff-a491-40d1-897c-9a71faa986f2-1
00:49:35.994 --> 00:49:36.800
best in your life.

812ec322-70e6-4603-b88e-0ecf89b52be7-0
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:37.920
Yes or no?

383a8e3d-9149-499b-92ca-441f36a5a776-0
00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.080
Hmm.

8d178ccf-dd8f-4a18-8992-6b3ce809bb8d-0
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.120
You're very unhappy today.

695571ab-1dc7-485f-b87c-a2625f855a7d-0
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.019
Even the people that you love most in your life, in your life,

695571ab-1dc7-485f-b87c-a2625f855a7d-1
00:49:45.019 --> 00:49:46.360
even they are irritating.

0dff1978-0d3e-4a89-b14c-6df5284bb471-0
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.320
Yes or no.

b4a1f982-0c68-49bb-b684-17b891081ace-0
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.920
When you're happy, everybody is wonderful.

fc17f4d0-dd75-4e8b-a35d-94e916a7f6d8-0
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.000
Everything is wonderful.

ef368e20-d559-4e3d-9bea-cd415841b74f-0
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.080
This ambiance is needed.

af521fcb-b31f-4c32-aa61-fe2af94c8cd0-0
00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.760
This is not an end goal.

f7b3fd77-55e7-4bce-a754-76731c82110f-0
00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.240
To live peacefully and joyfully is not an end goal.

bc90c6b3-fdff-47af-8823-05c4ddd8fba0-0
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:05.480
First of all, it's silly even to think that way, because as a

bc90c6b3-fdff-47af-8823-05c4ddd8fba0-1
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.898
child, up to 5-6 years of age, if you had the basic necessities

bc90c6b3-fdff-47af-8823-05c4ddd8fba0-2
00:50:09.898 --> 00:50:14.109
in your home, your parents had provided some fundamentals to

bc90c6b3-fdff-47af-8823-05c4ddd8fba0-3
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.799
your life.

54e90e9d-db23-4866-b0bf-5d3eb9d52240-0
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.840
You were joyful and peaceful by your own nature, isn't it?

eb277932-59b8-4a75-b523-5ee462ebc568-0
00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.520
So that's a square one of life.

193dbd9c-b36c-4cd5-9035-c36af5de2b29-0
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.826
But somewhere some deviated, distorted people came up with

193dbd9c-b36c-4cd5-9035-c36af5de2b29-1
00:50:26.826 --> 00:50:31.320
this idea that to be peaceful and happy is the ultimate goal

193dbd9c-b36c-4cd5-9035-c36af5de2b29-2
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:31.910
of life.

a7d9d8f8-3188-4bbe-b4bc-ecd0659f1598-0
00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:35.648
They are making the square one of your life as the ultimate

a7d9d8f8-3188-4bbe-b4bc-ecd0659f1598-1
00:50:35.648 --> 00:50:36.710
goal of your life.

e028f0cf-b3ef-49fd-9e33-79ba1c703aea-0
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:37.550
This is a crime.

fba6a5ed-3436-4ed5-a67d-8cf211afe845-0
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:48.430
See, I told you I will teach you alphabets and I said A.

4e0d2279-cfc1-42ad-a0a8-6de4adbcf58c-0
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:50.150
You said A.

c581e0ae-e719-44fa-8e93-3c3d8eb3fd49-0
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.070
A, A, A, A.

82e6c83b-3726-46c4-add2-c07cab0fe523-0
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:53.110
A.

0e6b0b5d-3094-420c-a661-bea03fc24123-0
00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:54.830
A, A, A.

eac9e79c-d0f9-4750-a3df-e9ca00257239-0
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:59.150
You got it.

045dce0b-9a01-4695-b79d-8963d6ec22a2-0
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.070
This is a crime or no.

5d20dfec-172f-4d22-9f5a-696ff829cc13-0
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.590
Hello.

c91bac4f-8b52-460b-a757-70071ad9f413-0
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:07.527
I said this 26 times or 212
times, depending upon the

c91bac4f-8b52-460b-a757-70071ad9f413-1
00:51:07.527 --> 00:51:08.110
language.

b7f964cf-bb46-4f66-982c-9a4eae40799c-0
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:13.710
54 times or 212 times, whatever you were thinking.

0867c388-8ea0-46e0-b0fc-e2f1677f056b-0
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:17.390
You're learning alphabets, but I told you only A, A, A, A, A.

1262269a-196b-4af1-b1c2-ac1ad6bda4b0-0
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:22.830
A crime or no sadhguru.

58a57617-6005-4b6f-9882-bdaf335e9979-0
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:27.344
Unfortunately, this crime has been happening that now people

58a57617-6005-4b6f-9882-bdaf335e9979-1
00:51:27.344 --> 00:51:31.859
are going about saying Peace of Mind is the ultimate goal of

58a57617-6005-4b6f-9882-bdaf335e9979-2
00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:32.229
life.

dc691164-11a6-45e3-9df2-752565f2c294-0
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.070
Such people will only rest in peace.

af607c48-d609-45af-8c0a-50513652ccc4-0
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:43.165
To be peaceful and joyful was very natural for you as a child,

af607c48-d609-45af-8c0a-50513652ccc4-1
00:51:43.165 --> 00:51:43.790
isn't it?

0b10c066-5584-47e0-8ff5-0a160f1886c0-0
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:48.940
At the age of five, if you are so joyful, by the time you're

0b10c066-5584-47e0-8ff5-0a160f1886c0-1
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.230
30, you should have been ecstatic.

886224ce-46c5-4d02-b2d0-5afada94d23a-0
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:57.060
But by the time you're 30, chin is touching the floor.

5e0d95b4-ca0c-4fce-8386-5fb760f9316b-0
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.084
For a whole lot of people, you have to tickle them to make them

5e0d95b4-ca0c-4fce-8386-5fb760f9316b-1
00:52:04.084 --> 00:52:05.220
smile and laugh.

bad4683a-0f39-404a-8b02-3f2426e8e1f7-0
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.780
Many have reached a condition.

ced1c316-fd92-44df-816d-1730115560b7-0
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.620
If you tickle them also, they will get angry.

0d5f6b31-511d-4817-9497-50fcebab0038-0
00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.620
Yes, bitterness has grown within them.

37424591-0c3c-450e-962a-926d1ed86f5a-0
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.780
They think it's because of the world.

35fe0ade-a907-40aa-b32c-ee6211a27e79-0
00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.300
No.

2afd1e01-491f-46d2-9adc-dd0c5567c297-0
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:21.250
No, world does not cause bitterness.

11dfb4b6-e8bd-48a0-8896-6723b77a749b-0
00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:25.850
It is your response to it which causes bitterness.

846cb51f-123b-4350-9539-4e7cc8f44ca8-0
00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:30.625
This is why your ability to respond is vital, to create an

846cb51f-123b-4350-9539-4e7cc8f44ca8-1
00:52:30.625 --> 00:52:35.349
ambience where there are bigger possibilities within you that

846cb51f-123b-4350-9539-4e7cc8f44ca8-2
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:39.768
you don't go on imagining somebody is causing pain to you

846cb51f-123b-4350-9539-4e7cc8f44ca8-3
00:52:39.768 --> 00:52:40.530
right now.

4aad8010-0e86-4633-a368-e51ac06d1026-0
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:41.850
I'm going to abuse you, OK?

eac992d5-177d-45e8-82fe-11e9eeb2a2fe-0
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:48.563
Hello, if you do not know English language and if I put up

eac992d5-177d-45e8-82fe-11e9eeb2a2fe-1
00:52:48.563 --> 00:52:54.750
a face like this and say I love you, you think I'm abusing you

eac992d5-177d-45e8-82fe-11e9eeb2a2fe-2
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:55.340
or no?

99905d98-ead7-4a2a-ba89-247dfe4eaacb-0
00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:56.500
Hello.

27d9850c-f454-4443-ae00-fe197655411d-0
00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.020
Yes or no.

5e4883d3-0087-4388-8028-9b6477d864b3-0
00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.020
So abuse.

ddc1a95b-4326-4d7e-9c9a-320a72a39ae2-0
00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:09.300
If somebody abuses you, it is on them for you.

3afc329f-c46d-4ff2-a8e1-02fcaad589d6-0
00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.260
It is the way you respond.

30e37a9f-1d92-4a23-b662-75f3f7467b8e-0
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:15.770
Suppose they are abusing you in Tamil language sometimes.

fd157304-edaa-4b45-b67d-22def0fc55d5-0
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:16.890
Just forget Tamil.

c3f3cf03-555d-46f1-8751-a1b476a5680c-0
00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:19.090
It looks cute, you know.

18ec37b2-db9e-4798-be67-e62cf4fe7912-0
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:21.050
Hello.

f565ea3f-d9c8-421a-ba91-3acffe286155-0
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:24.250
But you're living in the society.

9935b4d6-3f40-4e96-a0b1-024a39f5141a-0
00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:25.450
You have things to do.

d9d34a04-e705-419d-a06f-01c686e3c27a-0
00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:27.250
You have to say what you have to say.

d6cec8f7-3b33-4210-aa75-63bff5f9ffd1-0
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:29.250
Ah, that's fine.

6f901271-1d01-4437-a804-a160ebac2355-0
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.530
What you have to say, you must say.

5bda7e0a-a8c7-446a-8313-226561085bb7-0
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:31.770
You can't just let it go.

4f1399fd-cca3-4de8-b719-eeddd868e974-0
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:33.770
You have to respond.

30d1b6d6-ea22-4db2-a5fd-efce9ae26605-0
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:39.550
But it is violent reaction, compulsive reaction which is

30d1b6d6-ea22-4db2-a5fd-efce9ae26605-1
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:40.650
causing pain.

de53ff82-d91a-4328-b7aa-fac56eee1ea1-0
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.330
Somebody's words cannot Causeway pain to us.

08f7e5b5-f027-469b-aaf6-5408bc6f4c83-0
00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:46.270
Isn't it So they are not bullets.

c0432ed1-8f45-4061-8757-f441f8cb66fe-0
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.550
It is just that, the way we are reacting to it.

5053d932-a8d5-40a2-ba91-0e827dcdd34f-0
00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:54.590
So this is not just about being peaceful and happy.

bc20fe2e-80d1-4cb9-a576-70e57a81f885-0
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:59.070
This is about extending the sense of who you are.

67eec540-2a67-4086-b6fd-c75a77c6bcec-0
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:03.966
Because the sense of who you are is defined by your physical

67eec540-2a67-4086-b6fd-c75a77c6bcec-1
00:54:03.966 --> 00:54:05.430
boundaries, by nature.

54e03ed9-a2c3-4388-bcf9-cb5d9823e5d5-0
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:11.633
As you're growing up, you're only responding to that which

54e03ed9-a2c3-4388-bcf9-cb5d9823e5d5-1
00:54:11.633 --> 00:54:13.110
you think is me.

e05dfeef-cfc7-48d4-aa68-2d67f6d54821-0
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.280
Let's look at it this way.

b7175c4b-2d02-4ef9-a808-a413b25cd060-0
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.680
You're growing up.

2f67f7e8-7de4-4475-ac2a-0d07323f24e3-0
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.920
You became an adult.

fa022048-761e-46c2-b84d-81c7b8fcb305-0
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.440
Me, me, me.

7617e6cd-6a79-4d0d-8653-ef432e87b5dc-0
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.400
You know, when you become an adult, when you're becoming an

7617e6cd-6a79-4d0d-8653-ef432e87b5dc-1
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.880
adolescent, it's all about me.

c113088c-0e53-4d5a-9950-407a65e4805d-0
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.920
So your responsibility was just limited to your body.

310fdeaa-1484-4ad5-9c97-e745fa993f10-0
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.320
Then let us say you fell in love or you got married, TCH.

01d8df62-9293-4b7f-ac29-775f35a24894-0
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.843
Then you started thinking one more person is my

01d8df62-9293-4b7f-ac29-775f35a24894-1
00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:42.470
responsibility, Sadhguru.

3714955c-f20f-4f16-8d7d-0350487454ae-0
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:45.751
Then you know once you take one more person into your

3714955c-f20f-4f16-8d7d-0350487454ae-1
00:54:45.751 --> 00:54:49.397
responsibility, if they are of the right age and sex, other

3714955c-f20f-4f16-8d7d-0350487454ae-2
00:54:49.397 --> 00:54:50.430
people will come.

6e03efa4-574f-44cf-89b4-8722885d0803-0
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.830
Then you will become responsible for your children.

3b187cad-2350-4c79-9f06-0b09586ac9f3-0
00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:59.630
Also see, you're able to extend your responsibility.

d1bfe6dc-ee12-4097-b257-199be1def6a6-0
00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.950
There's no problem beyond this body you're able to extend.

97292b4b-58d3-47ed-9cc8-9485b4b44684-0
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:07.190
But your problem is you're little constipated.

28919bfb-290a-4112-a92c-03ccd5957b5f-0
00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:10.070
You know what Constipation means?

e5f7a753-4ecd-43b4-bef5-2fbeb258a409-0
00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:16.610
It happens little by little, Yes.

e33ce29f-89b8-4c11-83c7-68e2d6307ac5-0
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:20.890
If it doesn't happen at all, it's called something else.

3038b15e-7398-4bc1-99b1-684c8d23be94-0
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:25.290
Constipation means it's happening little by little.

83a3ae53-f096-4253-8dca-572103c30be8-0
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:28.290
Little by little, it's happening.

e91affd8-8d5d-4bcd-88a0-e61789451b6b-0
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.746
If you had a million year lifespan, I would have let you

e91affd8-8d5d-4bcd-88a0-e61789451b6b-1
00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:32.890
be.

b64d5484-333a-4fcb-92c4-2b1e585bd1f4-0
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:34.770
What's my problem?

f869d3fd-bf76-405a-9f4a-ef8c159dedb8-0
00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.655
Slowly, in a million years you will evolve when an amoeba can

f869d3fd-bf76-405a-9f4a-ef8c159dedb8-1
00:55:38.655 --> 00:55:41.760
become like you, Sadhguru, what is my problem anyway?

76c31101-0168-4002-97d3-af987140c8d4-0
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.480
It will do it.

443cf7ef-8b0c-4bf5-a8c1-d989c2ab0741-0
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.400
But the problem is you don't have such a lifespan.

72a425cd-590a-492d-8b96-fd39b8b1bd5a-0
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.960
You have a very brief lifespan in this.

e701ec49-6bff-4551-b65b-ff8617d2c9db-0
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.680
If something needs to happen, you need a key.

a0e8690c-31c5-4fe3-b9a2-2178990636ac-0
00:55:54.040 --> 00:56:00.094
The key is fundamentally this, that there is an intellectual

a0e8690c-31c5-4fe3-b9a2-2178990636ac-1
00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:02.080
person that you are.

9e50d77d-9095-4817-9749-651d803c5c68-0
00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.240
There's a physical person.

762411b7-cea5-4a3e-bfb7-83a70ac73439-0
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.445
There is an intellectual or logical or thought created

762411b7-cea5-4a3e-bfb7-83a70ac73439-1
00:56:07.445 --> 00:56:07.920
person.

c5c5dd2a-d627-40e2-9274-6a51d945356d-0
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.640
There's an emotional person.

d5685b5a-ebdc-43fa-b07b-44c6227484ea-0
00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:11.270
There's an energetic person.

547c444c-283d-4988-8262-394dbe97b205-0
00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:13.310
There are four people.

004ee44f-8c2c-46d8-9136-808b781e122a-0
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:16.582
There are more, but at least four people that you can feel

004ee44f-8c2c-46d8-9136-808b781e122a-1
00:56:16.582 --> 00:56:17.470
within yourself.

d059c2cd-d719-484f-8c84-55fa229c8dfa-0
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:23.760
A physical person, a mind person, an emotional person and

d059c2cd-d719-484f-8c84-55fa229c8dfa-1
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:28.470
an energetic person intellectually or let's say

d059c2cd-d719-484f-8c84-55fa229c8dfa-2
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:29.550
physically.

79456092-836c-4051-a471-7939a12883de-0
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.039
There is no need to breach the boundaries because boundaries

79456092-836c-4051-a471-7939a12883de-1
00:56:34.039 --> 00:56:36.990
are important when it comes to physicality.

2850c370-82ce-45eb-a4d2-c8c872906e2b-0
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.233
You should not think of expanding your boundaries

2850c370-82ce-45eb-a4d2-c8c872906e2b-1
00:56:40.233 --> 00:56:40.760
endlessly.

e5b14e22-913a-4f04-9a62-fb2d73cc54f4-0
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.640
That's not good.

74c42ff8-cd97-4e18-a5e5-f3242cbb1e97-0
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.360
Boundary is good.

461adda9-6b40-4fbc-834d-fbd48b78bcb7-0
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:43.920
Hello.

03ca7910-727e-4ead-843b-0f9fac42763a-0
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.160
Physical boundary is good, isn't it?

ded3e917-6bb6-484e-bd43-cd12ff495c48-0
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.520
It must be maintained and it must be respected.

8670d838-cfe3-4ccc-8f83-394f0b5f5806-0
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.489
Physical boundary is important because that is the nature of

8670d838-cfe3-4ccc-8f83-394f0b5f5806-1
00:56:54.489 --> 00:56:55.200
physicality.

13d7cca3-998b-4369-be4d-99b7c45bdbec-0
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.469
The definition of something being physical is a defined

13d7cca3-998b-4369-be4d-99b7c45bdbec-1
00:56:59.469 --> 00:57:00.040
boundary.

6df15380-7af9-4dc1-a0fa-c4687581cc4f-0
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.926
If there is no defined boundary, you cannot call something

6df15380-7af9-4dc1-a0fa-c4687581cc4f-1
00:57:03.926 --> 00:57:04.440
physical.

b4ba99a3-7c2f-46b5-9648-477150126e86-0
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.580
Isn't it sadhguru?

dc0e9876-9c19-433d-96c3-b91f9bc5f780-0
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.620
This is a physical body because it has a defined boundary.

ec3da005-28d4-48e5-8745-6ffc933aa27a-0
00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:13.260
If it was all over the place, across the cosmos, then you

ec3da005-28d4-48e5-8745-6ffc933aa27a-1
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:16.800
don't call this physical anymore because the definition of

ec3da005-28d4-48e5-8745-6ffc933aa27a-2
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.620
physicality is coming from a defined boundary.

ecc8b3d0-cba7-47bb-bc0d-81e6db38230d-0
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:22.660
Boundary is the basis of physical existence.

9822c274-0ea6-41bf-8598-4f1d8c4a51dd-0
00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:27.393
So you have to respect the boundaries of your physicality

9822c274-0ea6-41bf-8598-4f1d8c4a51dd-1
00:57:27.393 --> 00:57:27.740
also.

eaab481b-0d4d-44ab-8511-0e82678112b7-0
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.700
The next is the mental boundaries.

6b5045d1-ba21-4442-b7f4-27ee298728b9-0
00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.260
This doesn't need boundary.

1051ac5e-38ea-4ca5-8495-1071a8c0644e-0
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.890
If you have, if you put very strict boundaries for your mind,

1051ac5e-38ea-4ca5-8495-1071a8c0644e-1
00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:43.200
it will not be a functioning mind.

a89c6310-add9-403a-b6e6-28d320b13a27-0
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.120
It'll be like a rock.

6f2c0037-30d0-448e-b6d7-98406a501cc8-0
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.000
It'll go down and take you down along with it.

a3f59be4-ffac-4671-a33d-830e491234b8-0
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.280
Emotions don't need boundaries, isn't it?

9aa1f063-fd79-4ed2-b78c-a004a14e9f39-0
00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.240
Hello.

4480f9ae-3085-418c-bfc1-19b05b1387d5-0
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:55.520
Hmm.

50e80d8c-ed74-4784-b77c-cea25b25020f-0
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:59.240
Does your mental and emotional activity need boundaries?

94497b48-0aaf-441b-9db6-b46c536133ae-0
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:00.720
No.

e58f6799-5daf-4fd9-aec0-a16fd92c1f20-0
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:06.280
If you put boundaries, it only destroys all its possibilities.

fd8e4743-3b27-4968-b393-c4ef1ab87ced-0
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.758
Your energies don't need boundaries at all because the

fd8e4743-3b27-4968-b393-c4ef1ab87ced-1
00:58:10.758 --> 00:58:13.280
entire cosmos is a living energy.

5632592d-cb0c-445e-a781-ec42b43dae5d-0
00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.000
You just captured a little bit.

a1c26877-4a41-4596-993c-89e45e16dba8-0
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.255
How much you capture of these life energies will determine how

a1c26877-4a41-4596-993c-89e45e16dba8-1
00:58:21.255 --> 00:58:25.680
significant a life you become in your own experience of life.

8bd55231-fbde-4003-a14a-beed74b9e33f-0
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.600
That is what we are trying to change.

a5ad9a32-0ea6-472a-9abd-9d622ccae594-0
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:35.620
Shambhavi Mahamudra is about redefining your energetic self.

84a8d45a-23ae-44d9-a3bf-20ebb137a7df-0
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:41.380
That if you sit here, you can't sit here with ice gloves.

437a1b2f-266b-403d-95c9-feecd0d726e5-0
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.352
You want to see this, You want to look at the phone, You look

437a1b2f-266b-403d-95c9-feecd0d726e5-1
00:58:45.352 --> 00:58:48.820
at it because there is no significance to this presence.

7d115a09-7d8d-4643-b841-fc3e8e0004be-0
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:50.820
You have to do something.

3d494edf-dcef-4e1c-866d-868a89fadf42-0
00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.820
Without activity you will become nothing.

4df371a3-6ed2-445e-bee8-96cff014ebb2-0
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.180
Now you should become like this.

3703011c-eee4-4154-b854-e9c778dc75c5-0
00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:02.303
If you sit here, sitting here is a fantastic thing because it's

3703011c-eee4-4154-b854-e9c778dc75c5-1
00:59:02.303 --> 00:59:04.030
such a great phenomena.

5e5da745-db27-4d28-a3bd-7dcd88c4dde2-0
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:09.470
This will only happen if you capture more of life.

07c7342d-24c6-4725-801f-e1f0916617d8-0
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.357
You know this that intellectually if you gather

07c7342d-24c6-4725-801f-e1f0916617d8-1
00:59:13.357 --> 00:59:17.100
more information, more knowledge, intellectually, you

07c7342d-24c6-4725-801f-e1f0916617d8-2
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:20.150
will become a strong presence among people.

552e1676-675a-43f9-b240-06098c9d2249-0
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:24.846
Yes or no, emotionally if you are, if your love is not just

552e1676-675a-43f9-b240-06098c9d2249-1
00:59:24.846 --> 00:59:29.386
for your spouse or your child or your mother or father, you are

552e1676-675a-43f9-b240-06098c9d2249-2
00:59:29.386 --> 00:59:33.784
loving to everybody around you emotionally, you become a very

552e1676-675a-43f9-b240-06098c9d2249-3
00:59:33.784 --> 00:59:34.919
strong presence.

420398f2-45cf-41c1-ad2d-bc2275e409fe-0
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.520
Is that so?

2210b995-a3a0-45ed-a912-b7230623b3e0-0
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:40.920
Now energetically also this is true energetically.

3504c3cf-b048-41dd-a7b8-40dad5df7a50-0
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.173
If you include much more into you, and above all you are able

3504c3cf-b048-41dd-a7b8-40dad5df7a50-1
00:59:45.173 --> 00:59:49.398
to open the doors when you want to the entire possibility, then

3504c3cf-b048-41dd-a7b8-40dad5df7a50-2
00:59:49.398 --> 00:59:53.359
your energetic presence will be so big people will feel it.

afb33201-3faf-4ce6-be65-f9de1814de0d-0
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.480
That's a different matter.

78fb1c2e-13c8-491c-a5c2-81ebbb811be0-0
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:59.468
But the most important thing is if you sit here, TCH, you just

78fb1c2e-13c8-491c-a5c2-81ebbb811be0-1
00:59:59.468 --> 01:00:02.160
being here is significant enough.

4a23cb65-3086-46e5-99eb-5d46ceaaf33c-0
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.400
You're doing something.

f9af39ec-c930-40b4-8366-e0d6aef42372-0
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.357
Not doing something is a secondary choice, but you are

f9af39ec-c930-40b4-8366-e0d6aef42372-1
01:00:08.357 --> 01:00:11.120
very significant by your very presence.

de6bd502-da45-4740-82b5-3fd02fdde4b1-0
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.320
For your own experience, this is very important.

3404e617-b402-4a07-8e50-2f8f04e0e763-0
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.760
That is when your compulsive activity is taken away.

e5228f39-bc8c-4e07-946d-7477092f9fa2-0
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.880
Otherwise your compulsiveness will not go.

774179c1-01dd-405b-ac95-11eddf957069-0
01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.636
Sadhguru, you can tie your hands and keep it, but it will want to

774179c1-01dd-405b-ac95-11eddf957069-1
01:00:23.636 --> 01:00:24.130
do something.

5e813cf3-a92a-46ae-82c4-b8038691cd2c-0
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:27.410
This happened to Shankaran Pillai.

6e738a30-1746-4a81-ae2c-1a54b612c072-0
01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:34.940
So one day he saw that his office colleague, a young woman,

6e738a30-1746-4a81-ae2c-1a54b612c072-1
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.210
was walking towards the bus stop.

d88405c4-8183-4d9c-8e17-ef914cdc51b9-0
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:41.090
Shankaran Pillai said I can drop you home.

0d62240d-85c8-47a3-80bf-7dee59dd28e3-0
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.570
So she said fine and she got into his car.

d1f9e093-1ec7-4434-9a82-fd65741957fa-0
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.290
He drove some distance.

8e0eeeb9-ba20-43bc-baba-b7621478bc0b-0
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:48.890
A lonely Rd.

1f70519e-05ca-4f81-bfd3-a2229710ad12-0
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:53.640
He stopped the car and then he became like an octopus.

2c49ceb2-bb75-4cc5-8442-0eeede466e9f-0
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.360
That means he had eight limbs.

b42c4ec2-b957-43cf-a3ba-5b8dabf7dbf4-0
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.560
He was all over her.

c8a7314e-90d3-42e7-82ec-cd53f5a88898-0
01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.093
She pushed him away and said, You idiot, I thought you're a

c8a7314e-90d3-42e7-82ec-cd53f5a88898-1
01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:04.000
decent fellow and I got into your car.

787e102c-c8bc-4d3a-904d-45de8ad27b88-0
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.920
What are you doing here?

41d58331-c7b0-433c-8658-29ca08bc3969-0
01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.320
He said.

f885f9e4-9d5d-460b-9441-daab1903caf2-0
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I quit smoking.

72040311-aefc-4b94-a53e-e53fcc8e513d-0
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.960
So compulsiveness is like this.

3bdb2ac6-5462-4558-97f2-9bb9e38209e0-0
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.523
If you try to forcefully hold it, it'll find some other

3bdb2ac6-5462-4558-97f2-9bb9e38209e0-1
01:01:18.523 --> 01:01:20.600
expression, some other expression.

afd86d79-59ed-4674-ba55-1ca48480780c-0
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.066
All this is happening because your living presence is not

afd86d79-59ed-4674-ba55-1ca48480780c-1
01:01:25.066 --> 01:01:26.320
significant enough.

890a93c3-bedb-487b-8ed9-638fce1f8b94-0
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.720
It has to do something to feel good.

68e10b0d-54bb-4bfb-ac05-ab6d2ab1b927-0
01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.320
So Shambhavi Mahamudra is fundamentally this.

208943cf-ea3b-4ecc-a69e-cf332436ffbb-0
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.080
Today we will manufacture a key.

ebf14181-7caf-4f18-9689-25a707a744f8-0
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.453
If you hold this key properly and use it, you open up your

ebf14181-7caf-4f18-9689-25a707a744f8-1
01:01:42.453 --> 01:01:46.629
possibilities in such a way that your presence is much bigger the

ebf14181-7caf-4f18-9689-25a707a744f8-2
01:01:46.629 --> 01:01:49.540
boundaries that you have drawn upon yourself.

73c02041-02ea-41f2-b729-042f3835ee55-0
01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:59.883
Now for this to happen, a few steps we must take For this to

73c02041-02ea-41f2-b729-042f3835ee55-1
01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:06.180
happen, it is important that we do a few things right.

a0517825-5c01-43b2-9c7c-5328914c2453-0
01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:11.777
This is why I said this is a mechanical day, not a spiritual

a0517825-5c01-43b2-9c7c-5328914c2453-1
01:02:11.777 --> 01:02:15.700
day, not a romantic day, not a mystical day.

c9892cd8-cce6-43e6-bf78-317727fd1481-0
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:19.870
Because all these words have been so horribly corrupted.

4f389251-1f12-46a9-906e-a2e653be3cc7-0
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.076
If you say spiritual, people think they can do anything wonky

4f389251-1f12-46a9-906e-a2e653be3cc7-1
01:02:24.076 --> 01:02:25.670
and think they are spiritual.

7ed8fde0-ef70-4d18-a988-8eefafcc8f34-0
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:31.363
If you say religious, they will do all kinds of rubbish and they

7ed8fde0-ef70-4d18-a988-8eefafcc8f34-1
01:02:31.363 --> 01:02:33.990
say this is my religion, mechanical.

7161a3fe-d381-4753-b0da-926d30c66024-0
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:36.350
If you do it wrong, it won't work.

adcd78d9-08aa-436a-a666-57e7682b2615-0
01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:37.950
Is that OK?

2bc33a21-2ba1-4796-8f9a-6c1b4f73bab1-0
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.550
Hello.

c39bf658-8295-4772-8b23-b676e806e0d4-0
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:42.470
If you do it right, for sure it'll work.

ee2796ef-dd9f-4521-8bbb-653deb095bc0-0
01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.550
If you do it wrong, it won't work.

a535bc1d-7d27-42aa-8523-990f42041fdf-0
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:47.820
Is that all right with you, sadhguru?

9468084a-978f-445b-946f-5413da783066-0
01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.138
We thought once we come here, you will make everything happen

9468084a-978f-445b-946f-5413da783066-1
01:02:51.138 --> 01:02:51.460
to us.

5daa44a9-4ffb-4177-991e-d5790e152677-0
01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.300
I never said such a thing.

ee5c4acc-1028-4e16-b406-8dccfbfdca26-0
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:59.700
I am clearly telling you the nature of this life is such.

977f4ced-7bda-4671-bcc7-867e08082845-0
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.860
If you do the right things, right things happen to you.

e4c614cf-8bac-4ae3-9036-4855a15c9233-0
01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.260
If you do the wrong things, wrong things happen to you.

4b5a5413-b098-4027-b490-b9968069d5eb-0
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.294
Now you will go off into no, no, sadhguru, I am such a good

4b5a5413-b098-4027-b490-b9968069d5eb-1
01:03:09.294 --> 01:03:09.620
person.

20527936-d432-4a9b-885d-c631b6f4bf6f-0
01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.580
I never did a wrong thing.

4df12279-e47d-49ac-b1c8-5dca0886fa04-0
01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.980
But these people are doing wrong things.

c1fc73df-49d1-4f4d-b0be-8c89963fc413-0
01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.540
This is the whole problem with you.

bcb4b57c-0ff3-4088-b8cd-64b341039f90-0
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.356
You think, sadhguru, everybody else's behavior should be

bcb4b57c-0ff3-4088-b8cd-64b341039f90-1
01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:18.360
controlled by you.

c0b51b6f-297b-4451-940c-6ec0e1b990e5-0
01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.240
No, That's how they are.

8eea7792-3911-4769-a89d-879632e23d89-0
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.760
How you handle this is your business, isn't it?

a41fbfa3-103c-43c5-b0e4-1d7a681e5f6b-0
01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.240
How you handle others is a continuing work.

dcc1bcbb-6ba5-44bd-aebe-a612f1d4c11f-0
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.520
Yes or no.

fd3dfc82-b84d-4862-ada1-84fdd332ca93-0
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.600
That's not going to be fixed in a day.

8f27b3e7-1ff8-4927-a3eb-ec955018c5c8-0
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.800
This can be fixed that you are not the issue in your life.

ee06facb-4823-48cc-92b4-9c1715ca15c8-0
01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.200
This must be fixed.

814f0b3a-9f0e-47b5-92a3-021acbb98754-0
01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.280
Other people are there.

7584054c-5918-4d6d-a7d5-8aa37f9c4d1a-0
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.880
We need to manage them.

60d9d1f1-3821-4949-9901-c64cfbaffe48-0
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:46.770
Other situations are there.

af995fdd-998a-47b3-b816-70f5ec2aa42c-0
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:48.130
We need to manage them.

614e2ad5-666d-44d8-a25b-78a2cd9097e3-0
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:50.530
But I'm not the issue in my life this much.

bb7e4f6f-13eb-4f88-91d8-3e81b0c780df-0
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.570
You must settle for sure and for good.

d3a53dc3-4255-4a43-9795-0d0fd32f1e85-0
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:55.370
You yourself are an issue.

0469a7ec-49f3-44ab-b87f-4a975b497a98-0
01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.090
What are you even talking about?

ffea3f53-4ffb-4f34-be3f-2b5429af9512-0
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:57.690
Other people?

ead88168-dfb7-45e2-9a6d-0358bec6f09a-0
01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:04.410
99% of the time nobody is torturing you.

85b708e5-0ad2-4531-b236-17f46b1f7a41-0
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:06.330
You're on self help, isn't it?

41c866e8-2418-47dd-9d23-1ee9950df8fa-0
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.570
Hello.

ab4f53ce-71c7-4280-9152-0ff6d8256e58-0
01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:10.970
Nobody is around, so you're miserable.

7cd2b018-6b65-4348-8c14-e8fcbd9c7866-0
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:11.570
Is it true?

0bb76664-8199-415e-b073-6f11863446a0-0
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:17.621
See, if I am with you and you're suffering, I can understand it's

0bb76664-8199-415e-b073-6f11863446a0-1
01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:17.820
me.

eb476e51-10cb-4730-8f85-aaa086036d23-0
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.573
But if you're sitting alone and you're suffering, obviously

eb476e51-10cb-4730-8f85-aaa086036d23-1
01:04:25.573 --> 01:04:26.700
you're in bad company.

4fbcc7c4-c8cf-4aff-b165-06046f6ac646-0
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.980
It's very clear.

333ba344-5f52-42ec-8aac-83994f062911-0
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:33.315
It is that company we are trying to fix, not the other company,

333ba344-5f52-42ec-8aac-83994f062911-1
01:04:33.315 --> 01:04:34.460
that other company.

78f1e3c7-9b48-41b8-9aef-77d47ec8b4bf-0
01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.260
We will have to manage this company if it is fixed.

ca8959b7-4e50-4f0e-940e-c2a1d2a46a5e-0
01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.140
This is always a wonderful company for you.

4fcb2cb6-60e4-4411-ad43-293eca355606-0
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.321
If this much is fixed, Sadhguru rest is life to live in the

4fcb2cb6-60e4-4411-ad43-293eca355606-1
01:04:45.321 --> 01:04:45.700
world.

1077621c-33d6-4a2c-8ee5-34d2a0fab154-0
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.834
If you don't like the people, you can go and live in the

1077621c-33d6-4a2c-8ee5-34d2a0fab154-1
01:04:50.834 --> 01:04:51.860
forest hello.

a74c8b8e-2514-42f0-b160-db55a5618327-0
01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.780
If you like being with people, you can be in the society.

5cd72680-4307-435c-8cac-e74cc387bea3-0
01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.356
If you don't like being with people, you can be away from the

5cd72680-4307-435c-8cac-e74cc387bea3-1
01:05:00.356 --> 01:05:00.740
society.

09d051ce-b7c3-4f97-9938-cf35d24948e7-0
01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:01.740
That choice is still there.

82085f44-e45c-4efe-9ade-3fac9e001005-0
01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:08.174
But if you don't know how to be with this one, if this itself is

82085f44-e45c-4efe-9ade-3fac9e001005-1
01:05:08.174 --> 01:05:10.860
1 big issue, there is no place to go.

224dfd55-6553-427c-8da4-d14780322fe6-0
01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.807
There is really no place to go because this follows you

224dfd55-6553-427c-8da4-d14780322fe6-1
01:05:14.807 --> 01:05:15.650
wherever you go.

29f5453e-98a0-4853-8a17-498461f1b554-0
01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:20.410
You know how this person has ruined your vacation sometimes.

4e967241-a828-4aee-b9ab-00b3da10392c-0
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:20.930
Not me.

a78ca8f7-8a46-4754-af16-4a82217edf9a-0
01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.930
I'm talking about you.

3bfa77f6-21b4-4aac-a448-143b5c6e7fca-0
01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:23.250
Hello.

eca40ca9-9ca3-4076-976f-c83324d42904-0
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:27.530
You went away to vacation because you wanted to go away

eca40ca9-9ca3-4076-976f-c83324d42904-1
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:28.930
from your boss, your office.

c3179523-5307-42f3-91c7-fe4de9caf2e2-0
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:33.355
All the nonsense, all the torturous people in your

c3179523-5307-42f3-91c7-fe4de9caf2e2-1
01:05:33.355 --> 01:05:38.215
neighborhood and everybody but this guy came and ruined

c3179523-5307-42f3-91c7-fe4de9caf2e2-2
01:05:38.215 --> 01:05:39.170
everything.

6be6f3ec-f9fe-4303-b930-e0071d531fd1-0
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:41.530
Did it happen or No?

8e287447-08a4-4881-934a-804994e4dddc-0
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:47.280
So we're just interested in fixing this one person.

295f4b3e-41b2-479a-9b70-954876aadff0-0
01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.360
This one person becomes a great possibility.

6fd899c9-2471-47e1-8d90-e88f75133b3b-0
01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.200
Others will deal with them with the best of our ability.

dbcb162c-b606-45be-a3ec-a0456fa1d9c7-0
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.053
If they become simply impossible, we'll move away from

dbcb162c-b606-45be-a3ec-a0456fa1d9c7-1
01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:57.280
them.

aa927b80-47ae-4c3d-bc8f-70716cd874c2-0
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.840
That's all life is.

ccfa38d6-0bf9-4666-adb7-8d522a23526b-0
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.360
But this one should not be an issue.

aefa2d7d-f498-4491-9c6c-df33983cc462-0
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.160
For this, we will take a few steps.

d1ac998c-59d9-444c-89a7-d4acd857e145-0
01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.440
I want you 100% with me on this.

838622ea-d550-4ccd-93ea-e868b704d1ad-0
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.040
This cannot be done with deviousness.

2ba6efc2-c5bc-435c-aa90-c487d3b964c8-0
01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.737
Sadhguru, when I say deviousness, this is

2ba6efc2-c5bc-435c-aa90-c487d3b964c8-1
01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:14.680
deviousness.

b4bdc2b6-0b2f-4fc7-ab95-93a660bcf65c-0
01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.600
You told your children.

20852492-1c5d-4599-9057-b9a92348772a-0
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.518
See, if you're just teaching them a tradition, it's fine with

20852492-1c5d-4599-9057-b9a92348772a-1
01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:20.640
me.

87e7aa30-2fd8-46cd-b577-500324bb2c7a-0
01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.400
You tell them this is our tradition.

9a95805f-c187-469b-93df-6475d7284a00-0
01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.560
This is what we do.

103376d0-b9de-40d7-a9ec-e6edffa9355c-0
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.240
Why we do it, we do not know, but we do it.

c078952d-6af6-4b22-b788-fa038820e91d-0
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:26.920
That's it.

db00f44c-9663-406b-8c2d-1b60149ead6b-0
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.160
It's OK.

6906b118-611c-43b2-b293-53655e14276a-0
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:29.880
It's up to you.

1a72c477-ed09-4bbc-a696-d58f744f83db-0
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.940
I'm saying because some culture has to be maintained in every

1a72c477-ed09-4bbc-a696-d58f744f83db-1
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.320
society.

8f58464f-c4c5-47b3-8a4c-717293932fd8-0
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.140
But you told your child, see you.

ec18f5de-ae7a-469b-8aaa-199c6927c6fd-0
01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:37.860
Pray to God.

93ce088a-2d11-4db2-9390-d41889ecf877-0
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.780
God will talk to you.

ec428090-9e5f-4bf5-ba15-a8d2ce71ffad-0
01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.460
God will make you pass the examination.

98769800-d4cf-4288-a997-680accc5754e-0
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:41.580
This, this, this.

efe16423-265f-438c-b4e2-fce33f248e96-0
01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.820
You're committing a crime.

14210229-a57a-45c8-a6f0-e844d5ccee36-0
01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:45.380
Hello.

13c5877f-285d-44b9-ba4d-0979c95db918-0
01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:46.900
Yes or no?

842a0d32-bcf8-4c21-a857-e73a1efeb458-0
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:50.060
I'm not saying whether he is there or not.

8a2639b9-86b2-4077-9a60-5386ecec350d-0
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:53.140
I do not know whether he comes and writes examinations or not.

d83f506a-e21a-4924-a291-73401ca80fc7-0
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.540
But you don't know, isn't it?

4cb251a5-c566-43fa-ac58-a306b30ff485-0
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:59.865
Because if you knew for 100% you should not have any doubt about

4cb251a5-c566-43fa-ac58-a306b30ff485-1
01:06:59.865 --> 01:07:01.140
anything in the world.

c95ef838-4fa9-424c-9a55-fbb43238ad3d-0
01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:05.943
100% You know Sadhguru, what will happen because God has told

c95ef838-4fa9-424c-9a55-fbb43238ad3d-1
01:07:05.943 --> 01:07:08.040
you exactly what will happen.

7ad8d629-6a23-44d7-8db0-c3fac37dc379-0
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.440
Hello, are you so sure?

ee14d98c-1ddc-45c2-bfdd-763768a77d45-0
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.600
No you playing tricks.

20e030fe-4eb7-4d1c-ae33-8979d6280c73-0
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.694
You should not play tricks with this because inward journey

20e030fe-4eb7-4d1c-ae33-8979d6280c73-1
01:07:18.694 --> 01:07:21.520
cannot be done with tricks in the world.

d848f9fc-f311-4ad2-9462-7c219777d40a-0
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.080
You may survive with tricks.

c8fa84f6-02b5-480b-962e-3eb42881fc2e-0
01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.720
This will not happen with tricks.

99c3700c-3842-488a-81b1-9bd85b16b039-0
01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.040
You may play tricks with other people.

fe9b96c2-25fd-416c-afdb-0f22b24255bb-0
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.840
At least with this one person.

70fbb313-c6be-420e-a76b-cf62cb19b286-0
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.600
Don't play tricks today.

4d7d91a5-6ff2-46c2-a6dd-0d84a3541de2-0
01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.580
That is all you need to do that.

2991f822-a7e1-4bb9-a9c7-fdfdf2f377fc-0
01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.980
You don't play tricks with this one person.

75dd5128-fdc2-4e2c-9cc0-f02ddd594d4c-0
01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.300
Spare him, because he's not your enemy.

2341d68e-0aac-4321-99e5-521cc8c5c90e-0
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:40.660
It's you.

19bc0e96-4786-498e-9d1c-30472434f989-0
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.380
No tricks needed, no protection needed.

3d1b027f-f438-469e-af14-28c148730065-0
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.740
You can open up to yourself, isn't it?

58959ccf-6eb6-4e18-a63b-2b512e1b0465-0
01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.260
There's really no problem.

fde40430-dcf3-4944-950f-adea8226bfa6-0
01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:52.360
And there is also thousands of kilometers of distance now

fde40430-dcf3-4944-950f-adea8226bfa6-1
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.660
because of the technology.

2394f8c2-c521-4b9f-adff-b0d7ef17ed69-0
01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:58.780
You're not even in my physical presence now.

823381ba-c2d0-4395-9764-26d98d046881-0
01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.500
This happened.

e1673b61-03d5-481a-8247-7f7f59d95db5-0
01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:12.536
There was a traveling salesman and two to three weeks in a

e1673b61-03d5-481a-8247-7f7f59d95db5-1
01:08:12.536 --> 01:08:13.530
month.

845338a9-5807-47a5-a038-c638c98b71c5-0
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:15.570
He's traveling, selling whatever he's selling.

2315859b-55f7-4ed6-bf39-39170f8532e4-0
01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:20.050
He has a young, pretty wife at home.

8e4b81da-9b5f-47d0-8730-59e2223ca237-0
01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.410
Slowly in his mind, a worm entered.

1a2c06fa-adfe-412c-8022-adf0af28e2a0-0
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:29.332
And then he started thinking, when I'm not there, what could

1a2c06fa-adfe-412c-8022-adf0af28e2a0-1
01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:30.490
be happening at home?

6379b87a-a9ae-46d6-9424-9772f884c73f-0
01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.766
Once suspicion enters your mind, things that cannot happen in

6379b87a-a9ae-46d6-9424-9772f884c73f-1
01:08:34.766 --> 01:08:36.680
this world will happen in your mind.

8cbedfe8-7c6f-4818-a676-d92ae3d91a77-0
01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.600
All those things started happening in his head.

2de043b2-1965-4984-92d5-0020c6762fc9-0
01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.240
He couldn't take it anymore.

b7a756ee-7e61-47c8-81c9-78e2ca70c92d-0
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:47.876
One day he told his wife, I'm going away for six days sales

b7a756ee-7e61-47c8-81c9-78e2ca70c92d-1
01:08:47.876 --> 01:08:48.320
trip.

e1a8ab4d-0741-43e9-89d7-b89d13e62d03-0
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.880
Within six hours, he came rushing back home.

408c22db-98e5-47eb-abdc-c9d6fed786ab-0
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.360
They are living on the 14th floor of the apartment.

a1403840-4ff2-4893-8c8b-49baab5c0ef7-0
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:06.183
Then he thought, if I take the elevator, if that guy comes down

a1403840-4ff2-4893-8c8b-49baab5c0ef7-1
01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:11.174
the staircase, he switched off the elevator, ran up the

a1403840-4ff2-4893-8c8b-49baab5c0ef7-2
01:09:11.174 --> 01:09:15.720
staircase, 14 floors went, and banged on the door.

ccd067e3-358c-4579-af98-19ff9bd2d10f-0
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.040
After a brief delay, the wife came and opened the door.

09e4ad20-26e9-4b6c-bce2-8046c6fd2278-0
01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.320
He pushed it aside.

e5bd7336-797b-4221-8b91-d5ce05251334-0
01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:22.920
Where is he?

d40c6880-ecc8-4ad1-96a1-e3836f588058-0
01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.440
Where is he?

09ec78d5-ba7a-4d69-a7c0-d40e2626ad11-0
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.040
Where is he?

8d4ef4c4-d760-4043-8b65-0e5b0f7a63a2-0
01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.640
Where is who?

4e20c994-39f3-458a-be53-1daf81ffad02-0
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.760
Who are you looking for, Sadhguru?

850f1641-96e3-4b0c-8427-51d9efb78b0e-0
01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.360
He went everywhere.

1c0ca12e-1386-484c-bac7-547ab0b6072c-0
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.913
In the bedroom, under the court, in the bathroom, here, there,

1c0ca12e-1386-484c-bac7-547ab0b6072c-1
01:09:31.913 --> 01:09:32.760
closet, nobody.

d5a06d33-76d8-43a6-bbfd-923a9015ae7e-0
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.240
Then he came and looked out of the window.

0d70ab4c-c6af-446e-a7ff-a619bfc1b4cc-0
01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.242
There, down below in the parking lot, a young man in a

0d70ab4c-c6af-446e-a7ff-a619bfc1b4cc-1
01:09:43.242 --> 01:09:44.640
convertible car.

369b0955-6cd8-4549-b29a-eccb56cbbb11-0
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.480
He's starting the car in a hurry, he said.

96d4e092-ef03-417f-950c-b7ed1af65893-0
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.360
Oh, there he goes.

8889c666-16e0-4e62-b645-9f3c237e2287-0
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.880
He wants to do something to him.

48a96b71-733d-4cd1-9fc4-e5c143831ee3-0
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:58.363
There was nothing around because he's going to go away in his

48a96b71-733d-4cd1-9fc4-e5c143831ee3-1
01:09:58.363 --> 01:09:58.550
car.

0536dd8e-c61f-451b-b480-d128f20cd8b5-0
01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:01.270
The guy is driving a sports car.

19b58521-e1b0-4970-9cff-3d2488b9b2ac-0
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.270
It must be him.

01589df6-7457-4c32-8197-8830ab52d698-0
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.744
So he picked up the huge refrigerator that was here and

01589df6-7457-4c32-8197-8830ab52d698-1
01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.150
threw it out of the window.

9faaa1c4-d419-4af8-95a9-3fe55ef3c1f8-0
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:12.190
The next scene is at the gates of heaven.

20c3946d-a53f-47c9-9829-d9a7ca0d95d3-0
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:20.150
3 young men arrived at the gates of heaven.

24709488-4849-494a-8137-5ee9a358a20c-0
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:24.930
You know, Saint Peter bored with his job because there's no

24709488-4849-494a-8137-5ee9a358a20c-1
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:29.025
traffic in this gate, you know, so he wants to make some small

24709488-4849-494a-8137-5ee9a358a20c-2
01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:29.350
talk.

b39cab3c-f375-48fd-bfd1-d38c5bd4875b-0
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:33.710
Rarely anybody comes when somebody comes.

b3fc85e4-5ebd-491e-a598-ce4b3f6f41fd-0
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:36.430
He wants to have some kind of a conversation.

98d64589-9e23-49c4-af96-b276bca70c59-0
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:39.630
He asked the first guy, how did you make it here?

4473b517-25e6-4aa5-9f28-47512291a69d-0
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:42.190
He said.

705d75f5-4005-485b-b0f2-885aa71bbbdb-0
01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:48.510
I ran up 14 floors and I was throwing this refrigerator out.

3b07ffc8-4d65-4eeb-be6f-02952412c4bc-0
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:51.270
My heart broke and here I am.

1af1e564-41f6-4c02-9974-5342df210b0d-0
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:56.810
He asked the second guy, how did you come here?

a393f681-ff29-4acd-8dfc-2f102cabe39e-0
01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:00.930
He said I was just starting my car and this refrigerator.

36b958de-45d3-48db-a74f-848cb8d3f953-0
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:01.890
Here I am.

e5ec4cfc-04b2-4e45-b24c-3872e401bb26-0
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:07.530
He asked the third guy, how did you come here?

abcdd7f1-3823-4b9b-9118-0b4dce9d24d1-0
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.704
He said I was minding my own business and sitting in the

abcdd7f1-3823-4b9b-9118-0b4dce9d24d1-1
01:11:11.704 --> 01:11:13.530
refrigerator and here I am.

a53cffc6-caad-484f-89e0-73589bd7a7e0-0
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.500
Life happens in so many ways.

05bbe7b4-eefc-421b-acbd-79e0cbec240f-0
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.113
The important thing is, are you fit for life or are you so

05bbe7b4-eefc-421b-acbd-79e0cbec240f-1
01:11:28.113 --> 01:11:31.580
fragile that we must keep you in a refrigerator?

5a8badf6-8c02-4224-bf3b-58775434818b-0
01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.820
This is the important thing.

0253a005-9aa3-4452-905f-8b1f05e218ef-0
01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:35.940
Life may happen in many ways.

f70344bf-35af-48af-ba79-d94b936c366b-0
01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.620
It is our ability to manage outside situations.

1fe1a6e7-9006-4289-8531-3682d54e0155-0
01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.100
Sometimes we can manage well, sometimes we don't manage well.

42c23efd-fd2f-43f9-a2f8-368f9d132649-0
01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.580
Things happen this way, that way.

b5d25d6d-bc18-465f-9926-59084956daad-0
01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:49.508
But is this person fit for whatever happens in the form of

b5d25d6d-bc18-465f-9926-59084956daad-1
01:11:49.508 --> 01:11:49.980
life?

82943c28-e892-4f8c-8d04-53d7d959ea8d-0
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:55.887
Sadhguru, That's important thing for this to happen you need

82943c28-e892-4f8c-8d04-53d7d959ea8d-1
01:11:55.887 --> 01:12:00.230
every cell in your body to be wrapped in ecstasy.

16697fc7-189f-401b-8a29-2883b0640354-0
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:03.510
Then you will adventure in life.

f9ae3cbe-73be-4e94-bef3-4c33e33a7447-0
01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:06.670
Otherwise you will hide in a hole.

28312cec-4e80-42b0-8f43-79e1479aa696-0
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:12.350
Shambhavi is this possibility we will go into.

2cb92843-2dfe-4394-b8a1-8169c340e4b1-0
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:16.230
This process is a break now.

bf02b793-933c-4913-9d47-a8d01b6159f7-0
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:25.640
I'm sorry, we will go into a break before that.

076dc9f4-202c-43a7-a503-c738bc7f1d49-0
01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.200
I want you to take this step.

946b267f-f7a7-4d27-8b9b-1e67f0e4e9cc-0
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.260
We have looked at how to stretch our intellectual limits by

946b267f-f7a7-4d27-8b9b-1e67f0e4e9cc-1
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.200
consciously responding.

e728b352-2095-4898-aa38-0cde53b04af5-0
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.480
But emotionally we are still like this.

221a26c7-57ee-48bf-9314-867c5c4d30dd-0
01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.792
If I look at one person, ha ha ha, all love, well look at this

221a26c7-57ee-48bf-9314-867c5c4d30dd-1
01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:48.360
person.

60433a31-03ae-4617-9735-6bde7604fea2-0
01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.600
What is doing this?

7ce6312b-a569-4e9f-a13c-19bed1123ff0-0
01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.700
Somewhere you have fixed it.

a877d7b4-6575-4464-8257-7462ced20a4a-0
01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.100
This belongs to me.

9bedac38-7fe5-41bb-98ec-08dd3f726b47-0
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.260
This doesn't belong to me.

7a642ac4-424f-47d0-8fc7-bf7876e9fe1c-0
01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.140
I love this one.

8ea65027-6ac6-4543-acc1-1bedd66d1d01-0
01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.060
I hate that one.

06174a79-a226-4886-ab55-0b05e52c9b38-0
01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:00.460
I can't stand this one.

f02dfff4-20da-4344-ba22-3c0185e51368-0
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.100
This is great.

96953a7b-4aee-4b5c-9291-691af8937550-0
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.420
That is one horrible.

e66438ac-a7d3-4e74-9f37-ce21b3fb0d90-0
01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.140
You fixed all these things.

eb54de4e-e17c-4695-bc01-3d8fdd0ca4c8-0
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.380
Shall we take a step beyond that today?

8e319544-46fd-4053-8da8-c6d85fb8ce85-0
01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:08.620
Hello.

f818bb4c-c46c-419e-aafa-9099f2cf3560-0
01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:10.820
Hello.

e7c1e6e8-c451-45c5-8733-5de95262a438-0
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:12.900
See.

ab82a3a5-1f74-4b7b-af8f-8431ab4e7528-0
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.540
You need to understand this.

953e7578-a83a-4fda-ae0a-e26931b541bd-0
01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.580
Most human beings on this planet.

b5132dde-f225-4a46-90b1-a5a4621a4460-0
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:24.392
Most Sadhguru, 95% or 99% of the human beings you are never going

b5132dde-f225-4a46-90b1-a5a4621a4460-1
01:13:24.392 --> 01:13:26.560
to meet in your life.

2e75f9cb-a222-4474-93a5-ec586620dd4b-0
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.080
Yes or no.

292f9cf2-27f7-40b3-aa7c-dcfe45d8dc5e-0
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.320
Hello 99% of the human beings you will not meet.

9dd3819b-5955-433f-8c23-55f5a9648aed-0
01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.902
There is no harm in dropping prejudice against them because

9dd3819b-5955-433f-8c23-55f5a9648aed-1
01:13:37.902 --> 01:13:39.280
you're never going to meet them.

c9e738a8-b289-48e4-833d-cecf0a3f29be-0
01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:41.240
Hello.

f08b6fda-8789-4859-9736-0b326d42882b-0
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:44.680
Yes or no.

13efd62d-3df6-42b4-b40e-f7b4eeb9c6e6-0
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.628
You never have to do any transaction with 99% of the

13efd62d-3df6-42b4-b40e-f7b4eeb9c6e6-1
01:13:48.628 --> 01:13:49.800
humanity, isn't it?

ee00c4a3-52cd-4356-8ce4-2b39fd88fdfb-0
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.390
So what is the point carrying them as a burden thinking they

ee00c4a3-52cd-4356-8ce4-2b39fd88fdfb-1
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:55.960
may be this, They may be that.

00479bcc-7db4-4fd6-bd10-f9e57a3e8fc1-0
01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:56.560
What is this?

87b810ce-dfec-4c2e-a9bb-92eb9fd4b035-0
01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.200
What is that?

c8c3cb1a-c0ed-4389-baa9-39d2d3cd8360-0
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.360
We can drop it.

ebc72cdd-e251-4891-99b8-e20580862705-0
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.640
What does dropping mean?

e7505051-9762-4651-9790-6cda92026026-0
01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:08.360
See if you have children when how many of you have your own

e7505051-9762-4651-9790-6cda92026026-1
01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.320
children?

f0f585b6-2f0d-4eeb-9e05-902bfa1e6b10-0
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:12.760
Hmm.

c84ac4a2-867d-41f9-bbb4-73da5870b775-0
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.798
If you have a child, when you got the child you just looked at

c84ac4a2-867d-41f9-bbb4-73da5870b775-1
01:14:16.798 --> 01:14:17.440
the child.

542111b5-aed5-4cfc-a38a-dde0d82e4a76-0
01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:26.348
This fresh life, Simply looking at the simple thing like this

542111b5-aed5-4cfc-a38a-dde0d82e4a76-1
01:14:26.348 --> 01:14:29.880
didn't do any great things.

1a635214-7099-4649-99e3-67963b3ba6cc-0
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:30.760
Wow.

d0b35702-ffbf-4d68-8ae8-db25ce3bb281-0
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.040
It burst out within you just looking at it, isn't it?

589781b7-f335-431a-ab73-507927185be8-0
01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.640
Because just life.

89e0d089-2e00-4f2b-9ad1-f9fd7aecf221-0
01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.779
No personality, no particular character, no certain capability

89e0d089-2e00-4f2b-9ad1-f9fd7aecf221-1
01:14:41.779 --> 01:14:43.080
and incapability.

ec427a9c-9677-4b1b-bfc3-376cdce6f1a2-0
01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:43.560
Nothing.

49860c8d-30ab-4d22-8c0f-322927c1dab2-0
01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.507
Simply you are not being excited about his inability to say or do

49860c8d-30ab-4d22-8c0f-322927c1dab2-1
01:14:50.507 --> 01:14:51.530
something.

4dd50ace-2844-41d1-99ac-c576c9264b23-0
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:59.332
You're excited that you're witnessing life, fresh as it is,

4dd50ace-2844-41d1-99ac-c576c9264b23-1
01:14:59.332 --> 01:15:02.610
without any other aspects.

99b96ddd-dfd5-49ee-9c38-82c426cf0493-0
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:09.615
All these 99% of humanity that you will never meet, can you

99b96ddd-dfd5-49ee-9c38-82c426cf0493-1
01:15:09.615 --> 01:15:11.330
just see them like that?

8eb278d1-ee96-4b4c-96a2-50bc75f398b0-0
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:12.130
They're just life.

91603e5d-b451-4d67-9a87-e9e527198c7a-0
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.890
Hello.

b8e49a99-99b5-4d45-bbf4-7e487ba5ad42-0
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:14.690
Hello.

440dc9c1-bde7-480d-a738-46711197e62a-0
01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:17.650
They're not going to be your neighbors.

a4cba26b-cce7-4e7e-87ee-275dcb23c390-0
01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:19.690
They're not going to be your mother in laws.

aa5817ec-7bc3-49a4-8721-06f34185b582-0
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:21.410
They're not going to be married to you.

24fe51bb-3290-451b-a8ed-1c1ded5f70cd-0
01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:23.410
They're not going to be anywhere around you.

8e71e381-92a3-4031-b780-23b6efdd3525-0
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:26.490
Can you just look at them as life like that Little.

71492c5d-6d4e-4d20-8a6e-4f9c8b0dd580-0
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:28.810
Huh?

0e0c85a8-770e-48d1-b53b-e3cab4e6a125-0
01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:30.090
Hello.

9f924d9e-a19a-4f28-8958-923fdf4f881e-0
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:38.410
So that means you can take this step.

88aa7b1f-c057-4f25-8211-9813db748c94-0
01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:43.610
Very simple, sadhguru.

c09f508b-a438-4fc2-b58d-aadc06f8df07-0
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:50.501
Because emotional Constipation is a serious problem that you

c09f508b-a438-4fc2-b58d-aadc06f8df07-1
01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:51.970
cannot emote.

63703090-7e2b-4eb5-8650-13cf6d5584fd-0
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:55.010
You cannot look at a tree.

2dab54a6-29a0-4880-ac22-eb182341f50b-0
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:57.810
No, it must be written on the tree.

6b6aaf44-86c1-4adb-a0f1-b2feee00b413-0
01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:00.290
This tree belongs to you, Ramaswamy.

f159ac1d-0ba8-4414-8035-2af577dc53b6-0
01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:02.970
Hello.

50a5662d-44a8-42bf-ae77-a516391c8b81-0
01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:06.530
I will write it on this planet.

836f2c28-976c-47ce-9fe7-39b7d0d0286e-0
01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.450
This planet belongs to you.

4c3ef1cc-a57b-4fcf-bb61-4d059603adb5-0
01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:09.970
Where shall I write it?

cf44b516-99cb-4a2f-886f-884cb0664a9e-0
01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.340
Tell me where you're going.

331aedec-8e45-4b47-a72f-7417af832ca9-0
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.420
North Pole or South Pole?

2f89cf43-5df1-45f2-a6cb-fab7da8003f2-0
01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:13.980
I'll write it there for you.

4f1c3e5c-af02-4ee0-9f28-0e00bc222492-0
01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.140
Look at the sky.

63599a72-7b41-4e43-937e-610764834d96-0
01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:18.980
You want me to write it there also.

4315ecd9-5a63-4935-b122-9d14071bbe41-0
01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.060
This belongs to you.

b822140c-8c3a-4aae-9ede-ba70de49b3b4-0
01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.420
You're breathing this air.

38d2473b-3511-4b7b-ac87-f92a378922c3-0
01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.060
This body is just a piece of the planet.

860dd202-9cde-4b45-9aa2-2f67cdca66a5-0
01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.060
It is not even that.

420027b7-ac66-49bd-9af1-14c88c849d36-0
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.100
This planet is yours.

c81a7142-07ef-4e70-822e-91326fcbf64f-0
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:32.620
It's you.

83f8770c-ac40-4bb5-8f10-20d5822e5938-0
01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.100
Hello.

72ee3d9a-3c11-4395-a872-f0fea6117463-0
01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:35.780
Yes or no.

5bda931b-4056-4987-afce-8cef4561236e-0
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:36.860
It is you.

6e29e645-488b-4c18-a3cc-2567b45f3917-0
01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:45.090
But this Constipation, mentally
1st and then emotionally.

2b71e911-e79d-4b8d-96dd-23194a730cc5-0
01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:45.770
And energy.

5d847ceb-7911-44ea-90f3-56364ba0c6f9-0
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:50.120
Energy just forms around that because it has no mind of its

5d847ceb-7911-44ea-90f3-56364ba0c6f9-1
01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:50.410
own.

b730e3ae-51e4-4a39-8bcd-816aa07a4d90-0
01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:51.690
Only if you give it away.

ed1952aa-e810-457c-82ad-f033d4cb008d-0
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.490
Energies expand by themselves.

63e13ae6-ee79-497d-b63a-c58388f2b0f1-0
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:57.170
Otherwise that will also become a thing.

0e171f96-2d5f-4bbb-9cbc-92b290aee39b-0
01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:00.650
Now it feel life feels like a cage all the time.

7184e4d2-8378-4477-9625-f766dc3247d8-0
01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.210
Not even a prison cell.

91cc78c0-94bf-46b3-b915-f6b5e4fd1706-0
01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:06.123
Most people are not living in a prison, they're living in a

91cc78c0-94bf-46b3-b915-f6b5e4fd1706-1
01:17:06.123 --> 01:17:06.450
cage.

0ef98ed8-b096-4f6f-ad54-ee7c2e50e4ce-0
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:09.050
Shall we break this?

7381fa8f-46e8-4fbc-8154-2b9c116354d1-0
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:15.560
Please?

b0afba9a-a813-4ce1-9736-cf9cfe8bda99-0
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:23.064
All of you sit with your hands uncrossed, facing upward like

b0afba9a-a813-4ce1-9736-cf9cfe8bda99-1
01:17:23.064 --> 01:17:23.640
this.

5aeb1daf-96b5-4ba3-b848-c7a1240cbd13-0
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.180
Upon your thighs, loosely placed, sit with a slightly

5aeb1daf-96b5-4ba3-b848-c7a1240cbd13-1
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.440
upturned face.

f11267d5-ede9-40a1-a089-798018ad37fa-0
01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.840
Those of you wearing spectacles, please keep it aside.

dc07d4ba-9360-4628-95b9-fca1ad9a42a6-0
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.700
A slightly upturned face, eyes closed.

a3a09647-2278-4a4f-beaf-7bf69b5ebb34-0
01:17:47.640 --> 01:18:20.040
SSSSS Look deep into yourself and see could you be a mother

a3a09647-2278-4a4f-beaf-7bf69b5ebb34-1
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:35.700
and a father for 10 children.

46320dda-5a6b-4261-92e9-49d41e2ad2f9-0
01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.380
Do not think this in terms of reproduction.

8a074ed2-3b4e-4644-8a1c-801d321738f5-0
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.860
I'm not asking you can you produce ten children.

66206a76-2481-4c34-92f0-80840f32f122-0
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:52.476
I'm asking you, can you be a mother and father or a parent to

66206a76-2481-4c34-92f0-80840f32f122-1
01:18:52.476 --> 01:18:53.560
10 children?

9eb2cf53-f2b3-40f4-b1f3-ee35540bc344-0
01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:03.304
When I say mother to 10
children, this is not a physical

9eb2cf53-f2b3-40f4-b1f3-ee35540bc344-1
01:19:03.304 --> 01:19:04.120
thing.

a0cac5be-e4ac-4af4-b587-35543b25b016-0
01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.080
This is not a reproductive aspect.

8467cb95-5643-4265-80f0-e5f894d8a78b-0
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.993
Your mother means what she means to you, not because she

8467cb95-5643-4265-80f0-e5f894d8a78b-1
01:19:15.993 --> 01:19:17.900
delivered you alone.

c7ac456a-323c-4f9b-9c1e-b1ddf66034f5-0
01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:22.069
If she delivered you and they never cared for you, she would

c7ac456a-323c-4f9b-9c1e-b1ddf66034f5-1
01:19:22.069 --> 01:19:23.380
become your worst enemy.

93c60d6c-c123-4372-b38e-d62fe3780c51-0
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:32.357
Because at one time she held you as a part of yourself, part of

93c60d6c-c123-4372-b38e-d62fe3780c51-1
01:19:32.357 --> 01:19:33.180
herself.

51191317-1ee7-4535-93f7-6402d5275c36-0
01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.900
Please keep your eyes closed, Spectacles off.

c41a9835-06ae-4cc5-bde5-9a00b200d35b-0
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.420
Because she held you as a part of herself.

8fd35599-e281-43d1-9564-15b765ec329f-0
01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:45.370
That is why she's so valuable to you.

87f82ad7-5a5c-459a-907b-fa509b4a4d79-0
01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:52.805
So when I say being a mother to
10 children, I'm not talking

87f82ad7-5a5c-459a-907b-fa509b4a4d79-1
01:19:52.805 --> 01:19:54.810
about reproducing them.

c7d814cd-e9ab-46cd-b6c1-98ce0b4a00dc-0
01:19:55.570 --> 01:19:58.370
I'm not talking about taking care of them.

c9944c92-c23c-4312-a5e1-aafed8e3928e-0
01:19:58.650 --> 01:20:00.730
I'm not talking about feeding them.

e5ef68d1-7cee-45b8-9b0b-f6c9c2d28e55-0
01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:06.650
I'm talking about including them as a part of yourself.

81015172-a7d1-493a-a4d3-d0e966a95911-0
01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.930
Can you be a mother and a father to 10 children?

563ecc3d-2d7c-44d2-ab79-77f741279517-0
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:16.020
Motherhood is not about reproduction.

06eabc7c-203d-4739-917f-ba0f9d3fbc60-0
01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:20.020
It is about unconditional inflation.

839efa77-e14b-4222-83f5-b337f709eddb-0
01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:22.140
That is why a mother is a mother.

b74cf869-9d9f-4ab4-ac2b-296e8e544273-0
01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:29.234
We've even called this earth as mother because it doesn't matter

b74cf869-9d9f-4ab4-ac2b-296e8e544273-1
01:20:29.234 --> 01:20:32.180
what kind you are, she holds you in her lap.

448947db-fa4a-40e3-a340-29e45bc32c06-0
01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.591
You call this nation a mother because no matter what sort you

448947db-fa4a-40e3-a340-29e45bc32c06-1
01:20:36.591 --> 01:20:38.780
are, still she holds you in your lap.

739fb8cd-6bf2-4a38-ab3f-c4bc3cefab11-0
01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:41.340
That is what motherhood means.

48b17a62-2d59-44e6-8fbb-230396b19195-0
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:45.510
Unconditionally includes you.

9d36eb7e-763e-4245-aecf-deac7103e9de-0
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:48.710
Can you be a mother to 10
children?

d30d6968-ddec-42c3-95ee-b81435156f48-0
01:20:58.490 --> 01:20:59.250
Look deeper.

3b0cfefc-a4d4-47c1-8eb9-bcb04568af9e-0
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:06.690
Can you be a mother and a father to 100 children?

c331e364-e7fe-48c6-a96f-48e27a33737c-0
01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:12.890
This is not in terms of what you can do and cannot do.

30095deb-2604-46e8-8f12-740167e5fbdb-0
01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.530
Just feel and see.

737c3e24-7720-419a-973b-1ec1564bae61-0
01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:21.580
Can you be a mother and a father to 100 children?

62cd6baa-d429-42b7-a8a0-ee84f149fb0a-0
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.720
Do you see you have enough space within you for 100 children?

295cd95c-acb6-4a07-9497-2a1c633fba85-0
01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.560
You may not have enough hands to handle 100 children.

7837ad5a-c98d-4caa-8bee-0dc54c9ccf92-0
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.045
You may not have enough means to handle 100 children, but there

7837ad5a-c98d-4caa-8bee-0dc54c9ccf92-1
01:21:48.045 --> 01:21:51.080
is enough space in your heart for 100 children.

52b7ee5c-04c9-4877-8d65-17d968e35f89-0
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.560
Can you be a mother and a father for 100 children?

17145989-e092-4b28-86a5-6b99a11d2528-0
01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.841
Being a mother to 100 children is not a question of capability,

17145989-e092-4b28-86a5-6b99a11d2528-1
01:22:00.841 --> 01:22:03.610
but just a question of willingness.

fb05d03d-c491-4129-933c-71c1a134cf4c-0
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:09.292
Are you willing to be a mother to 100 children on unconditional

fb05d03d-c491-4129-933c-71c1a134cf4c-1
01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:10.130
inclusion?

d8cfe948-f8f7-4b2e-816b-05fa61a15816-0
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:21.110
Even your own mother?

944dc65e-03b6-4c91-94da-855ccfc2f8e6-0
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:27.232
Though in her emotions you were absolutely included when it came

944dc65e-03b6-4c91-94da-855ccfc2f8e6-1
01:22:27.232 --> 01:22:30.590
to action, she was judicious with her actions.

89cf1fda-c1d2-4164-8394-87f8a42eca50-0
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:34.713
So do not confuse yourself to inclusiveness, Sadhguru

89cf1fda-c1d2-4164-8394-87f8a42eca50-1
01:22:34.713 --> 01:22:36.350
transactions that we do.

cc41a9e8-983e-41df-88fe-255221b6cf8a-0
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:39.190
Transactions are judicious.

d963fbfe-2731-4033-82e8-c64684792a67-0
01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:47.070
But on the level of your emotion, feel and see.

a3049520-7c15-4415-bffe-5e7131f16a9d-0
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:52.470
Can you be a mother to 100
children?

3b558deb-691c-4435-9c19-722b5c0df65c-0
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.790
Look deeper.

9968d6d0-fd7e-4f45-bede-8f11464ceef8-0
01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:01.950
Do you have enough space within you for 1000 children?
