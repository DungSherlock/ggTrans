00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.400
If you have 1 billion people, illiterate, uneducated, this is

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.220

You do this for two minutes and then shishupala sana or rock

Next is Shambhavima mudra kriya.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.982

eaa43e64-de96-4030-86ed-cedcdefb356a-1
00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:03.736
time, and you notice the vibrations moving from just

You sit with your face slightly upturned.

9ac12789-a5b0-4047-815f-3d091000ffae-0

Have you noticed this?

ac2d9492-daa5-4ee9-8007-300c5126d9cb-0
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.070
So you sit with your eyes closed slightly up the face.

d903ded6-ac42-4e3c-a164-6fa0213a7fe3-0
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.433
Maintain focus in between your eyebrows and you get your breath

00:11:34.433 --> 00:11:35.230
into flutter.

8127cf19-e4e6-4ca7-a61f-48d604702fdd-0
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.110
Flutter means it should be both in and out rapidly.

3652a49d-ee00-448b-8854-10fc6f931625-0
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.230
It's just like getting your breath into a tremble.

24dfa567-d104-411b-9e3c-90c838a728e3-0
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.870

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.924
Stay there in the fullness of breath as long as it is

366e6d25-c529-4532-ba88-b27b49a88950-1
00:12:14.924 --> 00:12:15.930
comfortable for you.

a6ace8b2-1562-438b-82b8-5f154e1b77e2-0

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.076
Now you hold this in the emptiness of breath as long as

b20c31d4-7b01-44d6-a1a7-e4c936e5c673-1
00:12:32.076 --> 00:12:33.560

When you feel like you need to inhale, bring your head up.

f65e49c8-ac94-4dec-98e0-fdf51e96752a-0

00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:44.520

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.302
Then you sit there with your eyes closed, slightly upturned,

23ea8179-b667-4758-bd5a-693c300ce9e3-1
00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:55.761

00:12:55.761 --> 00:12:57.400
natural flow of the breath.

2a7228e5-1f2f-4eae-9462-dd86ea0e2050-0
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.064
There's no need to breathe in any particular way, just the

2a7228e5-1f2f-4eae-9462-dd86ea0e2050-1
00:13:01.064 --> 00:13:02.800
natural movement of the breath.

3158b955-6ae4-4270-87db-583f513b06fe-0
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.565
Your focus between your eyebrows and you're aware about the

3158b955-6ae4-4270-87db-583f513b06fe-1
00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:07.840

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.600
You sit there like this for five to six minutes.

bb5aca8e-a3dc-4f44-98ed-5fed61ed2624-0
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.800
Shambhavi Mahamudra takes 21
minutes.

5b1754ce-581c-40b2-8515-5b68a07e8d40-0
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.128
The preparatory steps will take additional 10 to 15 minutes

5b1754ce-581c-40b2-8515-5b68a07e8d40-1
00:13:20.128 --> 00:13:23.140
depending on how slowly you do this practice.

faaac4db-81aa-4d04-8619-ea6222132337-0
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.820
So now I'm sure you have some questions about the practices.

aff5c1c3-f8b7-4f68-9167-2b581cd4431c-0
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.380
Sadhguru will address some of this in detail.

c2e86d47-faf6-4cc2-9f5e-0cc7099f73bc-0
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:37.340
Now, how do I maintain the timings for the Suka Pranaya and

c2e86d47-faf6-4cc2-9f5e-0cc7099f73bc-1
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.660
the rapid breathing?

9a480df8-cf45-4725-a889-d0979d3bddce-0
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.740
Can I open my eyes during the practice and look at the watch?

6be92421-408e-4a45-a1f4-50931df18418-0
00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:06.094
OK, so when you start doing Sukhakriya, when you begin to

6be92421-408e-4a45-a1f4-50931df18418-1
00:14:06.094 --> 00:14:16.604
feel that your right arm may fall off, that means it's 3

6be92421-408e-4a45-a1f4-50931df18418-2
00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:18.080
minutes.

7274409d-548e-49ad-a7c2-10c220f94d15-0
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.430
That means three more minutes to go.

fb7669a2-3869-4ed9-833a-da533f3cc7db-0
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:34.030
This problems of timing is only initially first few days.

d9efe690-e017-47e4-a236-dffdb6891343-0
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.976
Once you start doing the practice, it'll naturally fall

d9efe690-e017-47e4-a236-dffdb6891343-1
00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:41.230
into place at the end of the Kriya.

6f6360c0-8b2f-409b-b566-c426dd246d24-0
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:46.370
When you look at the time, if you notice it's anywhere below

6f6360c0-8b2f-409b-b566-c426dd246d24-1
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:51.303
18 minutes, that means most probably it's a sugakriya that

6f6360c0-8b2f-409b-b566-c426dd246d24-2
00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:53.310
you're not doing enough.

e7d2718f-d1d2-4ff4-a4db-ea70ab885510-0
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.230
You just do it little more than what you did the previous day.

53a72d4e-d667-4353-a3b4-a2dc95a4b024-0
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:05.676
In a few days, you'll find a natural timing about the

53a72d4e-d667-4353-a3b4-a2dc95a4b024-1
00:15:05.676 --> 00:15:11.671
viparita shwasa, or the fluttering of your breath when

53a72d4e-d667-4353-a3b4-a2dc95a4b024-2
00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:17.230
it feels that you've done it for a whole eternity.

68760ee0-55c6-4c81-8360-516a526a607d-0
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.610
That means you're halfway through.

7e223f99-7ffc-4f62-b585-0a4f01dff1d1-0
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.245
These things will happen only initially, as you start

7e223f99-7ffc-4f62-b585-0a4f01dff1d1-1
00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:27.970
practicing.

e54fd5bf-f10e-45c0-99f1-f57d9a897e0a-0
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:36.448
The Kriya is programmed and the software has been implanted in

e54fd5bf-f10e-45c0-99f1-f57d9a897e0a-1
00:15:36.448 --> 00:15:41.370
you, so you don't really have to worry about time.

c1b0220e-2f2f-489d-8c60-5886dc7ed9da-0
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:46.482
You must more seek how to get in touch with that dimension within

c1b0220e-2f2f-489d-8c60-5886dc7ed9da-1
00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:46.780
you.

310f14a4-9f37-44af-8ae2-82cf8e3cf2d7-0
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.978
On a certain day when you just sit down, when you notice that

310f14a4-9f37-44af-8ae2-82cf8e3cf2d7-1
00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:54.913
it the whole Kriya seems to be happening from within on that

310f14a4-9f37-44af-8ae2-82cf8e3cf2d7-2
00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:58.847
day, you will notice the Kriya will be exactly 21 minutes to

310f14a4-9f37-44af-8ae2-82cf8e3cf2d7-3
00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:00.460
the second it will be so.

6913c8c5-219f-42a8-b48d-37cb56cde160-0
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.080
So your focus should be more on getting in touch with that

6913c8c5-219f-42a8-b48d-37cb56cde160-1
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.200
dimension, allowing what has been initiated to function

6913c8c5-219f-42a8-b48d-37cb56cde160-2
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.260
rather than timing yourself.

7e70180b-7016-420c-a1d7-bc5e7b95ccc9-0
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:19.518
Your way of the timing, just try to understand what is 6 minutes

7e70180b-7016-420c-a1d7-bc5e7b95ccc9-1
00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:22.500
or three minutes or 4 minutes.

557506df-34c0-4f8e-827d-da86b7f2deec-0
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.060
You can do that very easily.

52c72d9a-9499-4171-a8a8-f17846c1847f-0
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.700
It's not difficult if you just time yourself.

a719babe-8db1-462c-b0dc-279a31388de3-0
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.243
Now, if you simply sit here, how long does it take for Six

a719babe-8db1-462c-b0dc-279a31388de3-1
00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:33.860
minutes?

da4337c2-9656-4593-8ec1-0133e1a3763d-0
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.044
It depends on how active your mind is and how disoriented you

da4337c2-9656-4593-8ec1-0133e1a3763d-1
00:16:41.044 --> 00:16:41.420
are.

a6c4057b-e274-4cf9-8e3f-a9c3380ff147-0
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.490
Once you understand this, you will come to your own time.

ce5c6357-f2d4-4fbd-916f-07fbdbda6d0f-0
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.090
Being off a little bit this way, that way is not a problem.

0db2a46d-d191-4f6f-8a11-7534b48afba7-0
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.810
How do I keep track of the count of harm?

d0217e37-fe4a-49be-8f8b-68414767a013-0
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.610
If I do more or less, would there be any harm Sadhguru?

c0ee0fce-4110-41b3-abc0-9ba776153d53-0
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.181
I thought 21 was very much within your arithmetic

c0ee0fce-4110-41b3-abc0-9ba776153d53-1
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:02.850
capabilities.

a923b42c-5f33-43d1-a355-ca5d8f8f41c8-0
00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:15.172
21 is not a very difficult number, and one part of kriya is

a923b42c-5f33-43d1-a355-ca5d8f8f41c8-1
00:17:15.172 --> 00:17:18.840
to learn to use the mind.

2efde174-130d-4aa8-8002-ff8648995c41-0
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.459
Counting to 21 is not difficult, but being focused on something

2efde174-130d-4aa8-8002-ff8648995c41-1
00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:30.440
and still counting 21 takes a little practice.

2c86457a-4d10-4cee-8d30-15b017ec9fe8-0
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.462
So this multitasking within yourself is something that you

2c86457a-4d10-4cee-8d30-15b017ec9fe8-1
00:17:35.462 --> 00:17:36.360
have to learn.

70340444-35d4-4782-a34e-240c2f1e8c31-0
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.135
It's not just for the sake of Kriya, it greatly enhances your

70340444-35d4-4782-a34e-240c2f1e8c31-1
00:17:40.135 --> 00:17:40.440
life.

804f3d33-23fc-4de9-bc44-ebff5cd8dba2-0
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:48.298
If you do not know how to use your mind on variety of things,

804f3d33-23fc-4de9-bc44-ebff5cd8dba2-1
00:17:48.298 --> 00:17:52.610
which it can do, then a lot of you goes waste.

0ac3112e-6310-4d23-ab5f-177eaa29b200-0
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.210
So the Kriya is also bringing that dimension into you.

b5ce1910-5556-4c9e-874b-9657d1a35e0e-0
00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.928
But anyway, if you have problems with 21, you time how long it

b5ce1910-5556-4c9e-874b-9657d1a35e0e-1
00:18:01.928 --> 00:18:02.450
takes.

d3073561-c457-44b4-840b-83027fdef8a6-0
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:07.546
You just change arm one day and see how long it takes for 21

d3073561-c457-44b4-840b-83027fdef8a6-1
00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:09.970
arms and do it slightly more.

03963d27-e7e7-4f9f-98dd-e16d82343635-0
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.420
A few more is not a problem.

d15e0958-a893-4d9f-88f7-baf3b3a28e1e-0
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.940
Don't do less than 21.

346bdfa8-dc93-4d83-98b9-147413713bf8-0
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.620
If it's a little more, it's OK.

dcc8a509-e174-4f18-b45d-8ec21cc421f7-0
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.700
I am not able to do the flutter properly.

32101f5d-b52c-48e4-bd67-fbe56e3348a0-0
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.300
I feel breathless.

63995645-df0b-48cf-96b1-521d0e333d73-0
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.300
Can I stop and take a deep inhalation or exit fully and

63995645-df0b-48cf-96b1-521d0e333d73-1
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.100
then continue?

4509d6de-5ad7-4677-be34-0655e146df27-0
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.509
The fluttering of the breath may take a few days for you to get

4509d6de-5ad7-4677-be34-0655e146df27-1
00:18:35.509 --> 00:18:36.700
the actual practice.

5cf5e94e-3de6-4de2-bbb1-7cc90a1f7900-0
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.350
Do you understand what you need to do?

845e523b-dfe8-4324-8b81-a0ecb6942cfa-0
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.315
What you're doing is in and out as much in the surface as

845e523b-dfe8-4324-8b81-a0ecb6942cfa-1
00:18:43.315 --> 00:18:46.870
possible, as rapidly as possible for you right now.

95062581-1770-4c0e-ae5a-c795963a88e2-0
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.907
If you're fluttering is such that you're doing more

95062581-1770-4c0e-ae5a-c795963a88e2-1
00:18:51.907 --> 00:18:56.320
exhalation than inhalation, then after some time you have to suck

95062581-1770-4c0e-ae5a-c795963a88e2-2
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.389
in or by itself.

71570e0c-1c52-4316-8cb8-ffa2f74c64e9-0
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.470
Once you flutter, after some time the body takes over and

71570e0c-1c52-4316-8cb8-ffa2f74c64e9-1
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.609
does its own thing of going in waves and different types of

71570e0c-1c52-4316-8cb8-ffa2f74c64e9-2
00:19:05.609 --> 00:19:06.230
patterns.

6380aca4-d225-4ad2-89e7-4828e1b5b854-0
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.110
If such a thing happens, it's OK you don't try to control that.

f2bd7a39-e5c2-4570-9aec-f8b7ccc92646-0
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.275
It takes a little bit of practice, a few days of

f2bd7a39-e5c2-4570-9aec-f8b7ccc92646-1
00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:16.710
practice.

e6b721e4-1fa9-48b4-ab6c-4a62f65e3f71-0
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.670
But mentally, do you understand what needs to be done?

8913f5e0-0d2a-4ae5-b0e8-8df3db8fbdd2-0
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.630
If you have understood that, it's fine.

38bfd45d-8cfe-40c5-8e71-d3c8fd73ab0f-0
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.470
My body is shaking during the kriya.

48bac649-ef3f-493c-8b6f-ea3cb1f1e7c1-0
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.270
Hands and body are trembling.

d1a95c10-3bf7-46ca-8c06-27808585133b-0
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:31.830
Why?

123370d4-6ded-4db4-8385-f3069014e02a-0
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.166
The purpose of the Kriya, or the fundamental nature of the Kriya,

123370d4-6ded-4db4-8385-f3069014e02a-1
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:53.172
is to activate your energies to a higher pitch and a higher

123370d4-6ded-4db4-8385-f3069014e02a-2
00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:53.840
intensity.

f377aaab-0851-4a2a-85b5-de010df3e088-0
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.480
The whole process of life is just this.

b4c0472a-4ce8-4b82-aa46-5f2bc5672963-0
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.638
Today modern science is proving to you that the whole existence

b4c0472a-4ce8-4b82-aa46-5f2bc5672963-1
00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:05.920
is just one energy.

35b60dec-67fd-4190-b7c9-ec1d2b88038d-0
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.400
So this rock and me are the same energy.

722d1f50-355a-4e47-8b32-7515166f6140-0
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.800
But are they same?

dc1737a6-dcaf-4929-9af3-1c4f4dd613df-0
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.320
So what is the difference?

0fc089a3-6c44-4f45-beab-84ff28e4a74c-0
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.583
One way of looking at it is it's in a different level of

0fc089a3-6c44-4f45-beab-84ff28e4a74c-1
00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:21.640
reverberation.

c5c0bc87-25df-4fde-b7ac-511551517ac5-0
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.398
The rock is in one level of reverberation, this is in

c5c0bc87-25df-4fde-b7ac-511551517ac5-1
00:20:25.398 --> 00:20:27.120
another level of reverberation.

8d7088bc-405e-44aa-9149-0c5f8c5d3aa8-0
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.014
So everything that you see in the existence is just the same

8d7088bc-405e-44aa-9149-0c5f8c5d3aa8-1
00:20:31.014 --> 00:20:33.960
energy, but in higher level of pitch and intensity.

b3f1620d-8f57-4a34-9a25-1d152dc7f0b1-0
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.389
So the purpose of the Kriya is just this, to take you to a

b3f1620d-8f57-4a34-9a25-1d152dc7f0b1-1
00:20:39.389 --> 00:20:43.776
higher dimension of intensity, because that's the only way you

b3f1620d-8f57-4a34-9a25-1d152dc7f0b1-2
00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:48.164
can evolve to higher states of consciousness, higher levels of

b3f1620d-8f57-4a34-9a25-1d152dc7f0b1-3
00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.019
performance, higher levels of existence.

9a0b9d0e-168b-4677-832e-b304604cecd0-0
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.860
So that's what the Kriya is doing.

de022de2-d360-45dc-a861-c505aec6bad9-0
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.803
When a new level of intensity and pitch enters your body, your

de022de2-d360-45dc-a861-c505aec6bad9-1
00:20:58.803 --> 00:21:02.020
body may tremble initially, or it'll settle.

adeacbc8-651b-49fe-9699-72f43e6bc875-0
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.660
Then if you move to a next level again, it may tremble.

50ac8674-5e7a-43ab-b53a-6354bc30aa39-0
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.676
It's perfectly fine if you don't want this body to tremble before

50ac8674-5e7a-43ab-b53a-6354bc30aa39-1
00:21:11.676 --> 00:21:14.860
I initiate you into shambhaviya waha mudra.

953d2193-0d07-4581-a418-a21db1bc5dad-0
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.242
If you're willing to do 12 years of preparatory work, then we can

953d2193-0d07-4581-a418-a21db1bc5dad-1
00:21:19.242 --> 00:21:22.290
see that your body doesn't tremble, but still you

953d2193-0d07-4581-a418-a21db1bc5dad-2
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.459
experience very high levels of intensity right now.

395e4d0e-6e47-4d89-a346-a8da7dcaabe8-0
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.612
Your system will tremble when it moves to, you know, when you

395e4d0e-6e47-4d89-a346-a8da7dcaabe8-1
00:21:30.612 --> 00:21:32.940
change gears one to another.

68d98697-a5d3-4627-af99-44fdc086dc23-0
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.900
It's a new level of reverberation in the engine.

0e7a64aa-febc-48aa-9448-e2dc14d06af1-0
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.020
Isn't it just like that?

622c6abc-c6fc-4689-97e9-7710b6ed749a-0
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.515
Just moving the whole life energies to a different

622c6abc-c6fc-4689-97e9-7710b6ed749a-1
00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:42.920
dimension of intensity?

443cdf59-3d80-44bc-abe3-ad55e2cfa18e-0
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.405
So there could be some tremble, there could be some sense of

443cdf59-3d80-44bc-abe3-ad55e2cfa18e-1
00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:48.680
feeling overwhelmed.

18be5885-ef21-4aa1-90c6-0c5595883ad9-0
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.840
It's perfectly fine.

f34756aa-1be1-4f78-996b-f6d4da6a74b7-0
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.090
If life doesn't overwhelm you, what's the point, Sadhguru, Can

f34756aa-1be1-4f78-996b-f6d4da6a74b7-1
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.520
I play music while doing Shambhavi?

63a94810-ee39-4e81-b057-5141315ad8a7-0
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.040
What do you play?

5328405d-c898-46ca-93ed-880a0a67971e-0
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.440
You play drums or guitar?

ce348077-b9f2-44b5-84a9-87850e08d0c8-0
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.790
Can I have music on in the background or doing?

f44cca17-d262-48fb-9b50-5a506c431a12-0
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.470
No.

ac9f5f5b-ba67-46b4-8e8a-3e359f88456f-0
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.350
The Kriya is very internal.

6bb57721-34a6-4c5d-973b-91ce9f88d3a4-0
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.907
You do not use any kind of music and other kinds of external

6bb57721-34a6-4c5d-973b-91ce9f88d3a4-1
00:22:22.907 --> 00:22:25.790
supports which will shift your attention outward.

1666de63-e44d-4537-8ccf-d9d92da23fdf-0
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:32.106
The whole idea of the Kriya is to take your attention

1666de63-e44d-4537-8ccf-d9d92da23fdf-1
00:22:32.106 --> 00:22:36.630
completely off the outside and take it inward.

b2633366-ccd5-44f2-9f64-c735d4701cd1-0
00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:42.627
Take you to the seat of your experience so that you can

b2633366-ccd5-44f2-9f64-c735d4701cd1-1
00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.460
decide how this one functions.

ccb97e93-4297-4cdd-b898-7c3b1e9f47fe-0
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.920
So keeping any kind of external distraction will naturally put

ccb97e93-4297-4cdd-b898-7c3b1e9f47fe-1
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.500
your attention there.

c7c1718b-9c9d-4125-8ad2-02a5cba5d967-0
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.260
No, no.

c1a5aaed-66fe-492a-b726-cd8221d21079-0
00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.980
It is just soothing music.

bd384da5-9d97-45c6-8119-e8bd287ee665-0
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.460
I don't want the music to be soothing.

bf6113d3-eeea-452a-be0f-cd6327a348aa-0
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.620
That's the whole idea.

c17d5c88-bbca-4bcd-bf6a-e402a3ba3380-0
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.000
Whatever soothing that needs to happen must happen from within.

a3698af3-7fec-46ca-baab-d57bbc955bb3-0
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.800
The whole purpose of doing kriya.

b8df75be-3630-4a87-8c15-654f11570a93-0
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.080
The word kriya literally means internal action.

7f6bcc12-0d55-4d8e-88b0-587f64bb5d15-0
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.920
Karma means external action.

607c0af6-65e3-4189-9abf-13f82d36a935-0
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.862
When we say internal, we are not talking about the body, we are

607c0af6-65e3-4189-9abf-13f82d36a935-1
00:23:22.862 --> 00:23:26.200
not talking of the mind, nor are we talking about the prana.

73072c1c-29fc-422a-967b-be76de904ad5-0
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.360
We are talking about action much deeper than that.

06dc9cbf-5bba-463e-a923-6cb7819e597d-0
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.131
So if that action begins to happen within you, sadhguru, you

06dc9cbf-5bba-463e-a923-6cb7819e597d-1
00:23:34.131 --> 00:23:37.290
decide what happens within you, not the outside.

47199abf-3941-420f-b5c9-f87b83e0e18a-0
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.908
So music would definitely be a distraction and in many ways

47199abf-3941-420f-b5c9-f87b83e0e18a-1
00:23:41.908 --> 00:23:43.130
weaken the process.

2774cd30-3960-4b8b-865f-1dfcd974543a-0
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:49.920
Sadhguru, can I do more cycles of nadi vibhajan or should I

2774cd30-3960-4b8b-865f-1dfcd974543a-1
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.410
stick to three cycles?

7a5b1938-49d7-4fa7-ae8c-1e812cd91f2c-0
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.450
I feel good after practicing it.

2cba34e1-87c5-4992-bf4a-af0281e38245-0
00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:03.134
Sadhguru nadi vibhajan or the cat stretch Sadhguru, you could

2cba34e1-87c5-4992-bf4a-af0281e38245-1
00:24:03.134 --> 00:24:03.940
do more.

e8523751-055a-4fba-bcb5-598ccf477136-0
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.020
There is no harm in doing more.

b5e7ebea-fb83-4268-922b-5f752dc8d8f1-0
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:14.020
But because it is not a physical exercise, more is not important.

16223be1-022b-4992-8c93-47d59fc8d553-0
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.582
It is best to learn to stay in each posture and breathe rather

16223be1-022b-4992-8c93-47d59fc8d553-1
00:24:19.582 --> 00:24:21.380
than doing more number.

4e8ec5aa-3f41-4628-845a-eda666ab49ba-0
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.082
The benefit of doing Nadibha Bachchan will be so much better

4e8ec5aa-3f41-4628-845a-eda666ab49ba-1
00:24:27.082 --> 00:24:31.980
if you can stay in each posture and breathe rather than trying

4e8ec5aa-3f41-4628-845a-eda666ab49ba-2
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.380
to do more cycles.

308268db-344a-4a63-86d6-ad6a2af1d7f8-0
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.210
Sadhguru, If I'm exercising or going for a walk, what should I

308268db-344a-4a63-86d6-ad6a2af1d7f8-1
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.900
do first?

abc5e2e3-8275-4b5e-b800-c846ce28701f-0
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:45.964
The Kriya or the exercise Sadhguru, it's good to do the

abc5e2e3-8275-4b5e-b800-c846ce28701f-1
00:24:45.964 --> 00:24:47.100
exercise.

54cc091f-ffe4-4225-9ad6-ef348d40f33a-0
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.389
Rest your body to a point where the breath and metabolism has

54cc091f-ffe4-4225-9ad6-ef348d40f33a-1
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:54.060
come down to normal before you start the kriya.

a8c103c7-1e7a-460b-8c01-5ae57bf0c064-0
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.460
That's the best way to do it.

c0d656a9-f6e8-46d1-b885-a2b326f12bd1-0
00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.704
If you exercise, have a shower and then sit for the practice,

c0d656a9-f6e8-46d1-b885-a2b326f12bd1-1
00:25:00.704 --> 00:25:04.500
it's the best way to do it, but not essentially so.

bfd9c623-3e79-4488-afaf-9528944a83e2-0
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.050
If your lifestyle is such that once you come out of your

bfd9c623-3e79-4488-afaf-9528944a83e2-1
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.608
bedroom, there's every chance that you may get entangled with

bfd9c623-3e79-4488-afaf-9528944a83e2-2
00:25:11.608 --> 00:25:13.100
so many things around you.

189a090f-4a98-4f07-8472-7d675f316b56-0
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.518
If that is so, then the best thing is the first thing in the

189a090f-4a98-4f07-8472-7d675f316b56-1
00:25:18.518 --> 00:25:22.870
morning you would finish the kriya and then exercise may

189a090f-4a98-4f07-8472-7d675f316b56-2
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:23.940
happen or not.

631f1e79-83b2-4de2-9f2d-2936de08fcf5-0
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.360
When I exhale all the locks get released.

12d0376a-c552-461d-94a4-7736b5edf4f3-0
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.048
Or sometimes when I release the diaphragm lock, the analog is

12d0376a-c552-461d-94a4-7736b5edf4f3-1
00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:37.600
simultaneously released.

6cdbe4e9-6d55-476d-941d-605a9f1174c2-0
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.840
What can I do about it?

db0f62b7-9bd9-491f-b1d5-fb7c0671d0b1-0
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.838
Oh, this bandas or the system of locking these three locks of

db0f62b7-9bd9-491f-b1d5-fb7c0671d0b1-1
00:25:49.838 --> 00:25:55.928
Moladara Odhyana and Jalandhar Banda takes a little bit of

db0f62b7-9bd9-491f-b1d5-fb7c0671d0b1-2
00:25:55.928 --> 00:25:59.850
practice and control over the system.

251f17cc-578a-408f-b382-28322cc0f3b8-0
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.460
These are not things you have done with your body, so it will

251f17cc-578a-408f-b382-28322cc0f3b8-1
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.010
take a week or two of practice to get the system right.

042f3496-b90d-4ac9-8219-3aba00e78484-0
00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.530
But you need to understand this is the way you do it.

2a9cde16-011f-4724-9c47-eaf3f40d777a-0
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.946
If you have understood the instructions clearly, it will

2a9cde16-011f-4724-9c47-eaf3f40d777a-1
00:26:14.946 --> 00:26:18.016
definitely take a few days of practice for you to get the

2a9cde16-011f-4724-9c47-eaf3f40d777a-2
00:26:18.016 --> 00:26:18.810
system correct.

51e48202-9736-4415-8b0f-ca29f916f282-0
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:19.890
It's fine.

17639a85-7ad2-406a-ae9a-6941895ace32-0
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:25.797
So the locking and releasing of the bandas are the locks should

17639a85-7ad2-406a-ae9a-6941895ace32-1
00:26:25.797 --> 00:26:28.670
happen as you have been instructed.

92b551da-d45d-4bc1-acd3-2963fc9e4807-0
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:36.123
Any kind of dislocation in this process in many ways lowers the

92b551da-d45d-4bc1-acd3-2963fc9e4807-1
00:26:36.123 --> 00:26:41.790
impact of the kriya, because that's how the system works.

d45093b5-564f-478a-b965-005e7b578d1c-0
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.090
So you need to understand that this is the way it needs to

d45093b5-564f-478a-b965-005e7b578d1c-1
00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:46.430
happen.

1b079dda-9123-4131-a9d8-68ea423d4e94-0
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.910
The body itself may not immediately cooperate.

e44a4805-0623-4475-9f76-57d3d5dbaf14-0
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.238
It may take a week or two before the body cooperates to the

e44a4805-0623-4475-9f76-57d3d5dbaf14-1
00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:54.830
instruction with the instruction.

0fdc8cbd-34e9-430e-a73e-88d61f922c73-0
00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:00.190
So you understand the instruction and do it that way.

5e653416-4034-4c27-b819-238a54547820-0
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:04.329
You will see within two to three days time almost all of you will

5e653416-4034-4c27-b819-238a54547820-1
00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:05.190
be able to do.

13da8ea4-2ffe-45c3-ade5-f5f906de50fd-0
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:11.231
If such a debility is there that you are unable to retain your

13da8ea4-2ffe-45c3-ade5-f5f906de50fd-1
00:27:11.231 --> 00:27:15.938
inner lock even after a month, then it indicates certain

13da8ea4-2ffe-45c3-ade5-f5f906de50fd-2
00:27:15.938 --> 00:27:20.892
weakness of the body and certain vulnerability of the whole

13da8ea4-2ffe-45c3-ade5-f5f906de50fd-3
00:27:20.892 --> 00:27:21.470
system.

92ffb204-0566-460a-a1de-68c365cf85e7-0
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:23.350
Such a thing is there.

61c869da-ff40-449f-99ee-b01c75605891-0
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:28.155
It's best you go into a different level of sadhana of

61c869da-ff40-449f-99ee-b01c75605891-1
00:27:28.155 --> 00:27:33.050
strengthening the body through Suri namaskars, asanas.

f8781126-f1bd-447f-938f-49b60bc66a6f-0
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:38.155
It's very important because if you are not able to hold your

f8781126-f1bd-447f-938f-49b60bc66a6f-1
00:27:38.155 --> 00:27:43.055
inner lock even after a month of practice, it clearly suggests

f8781126-f1bd-447f-938f-49b60bc66a6f-2
00:27:43.055 --> 00:27:47.100
that the body is in a certain state of weakness and

f8781126-f1bd-447f-938f-49b60bc66a6f-3
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.889
destabilized condition.

08a343f1-fde6-49db-8c06-2da7fe173a10-0
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.908
Sadhguru, I can hold the fullness of the breath for a

08a343f1-fde6-49db-8c06-2da7fe173a10-1
00:27:58.908 --> 00:28:01.320
long time, but emptiness for a short time.

b013478a-7bc4-40fd-b088-aaead23aec0c-0
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.160
Is that.

869f3394-19ff-438c-8211-e42eab8a8937-0
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:08.637
OK Sadhguru, this is decided by both your physiological

869f3394-19ff-438c-8211-e42eab8a8937-1
00:28:08.637 --> 00:28:15.230
condition and also your psychological situations, so you

869f3394-19ff-438c-8211-e42eab8a8937-2
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:21.130
don't try to hold it beyond your natural capacity.

de183445-3349-415f-b6f7-6543a6d0a454-0
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.450
Whatever is your capacity, you hold it that way.

7b8b2991-3e3b-4eaf-9819-4c22aa56a736-0
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.167
Gradually you will see the dynamics of how you hold the

7b8b2991-3e3b-4eaf-9819-4c22aa56a736-1
00:28:27.167 --> 00:28:28.130
breath will change.

6d4dd692-f798-4c2c-9b7a-1cab079f9544-0
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.344
You must be conscious that you must hold it to a point where

6d4dd692-f798-4c2c-9b7a-1cab079f9544-1
00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:37.798
it's still comfortable, but you're moving towards a point of

6d4dd692-f798-4c2c-9b7a-1cab079f9544-2
00:28:37.798 --> 00:28:41.450
discomfort, moving towards not yet uncomfortable.

5fdd3a8a-579b-4880-9a15-0cb24f124f5d-0
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.330
Then you must come out.

f3009559-df3a-48f2-9b45-999173287b15-0
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.490
You will see.

1b5662ea-32aa-4c44-91d1-c6216dcd725b-0
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.067
The dynamics of how this happens changes with practice, and it

1b5662ea-32aa-4c44-91d1-c6216dcd725b-1
00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:53.863
could also change depending upon what kind of mental and physical

1b5662ea-32aa-4c44-91d1-c6216dcd725b-2
00:28:53.863 --> 00:28:57.642
situation you are on a particular day, how life has

1b5662ea-32aa-4c44-91d1-c6216dcd725b-3
00:28:57.642 --> 00:28:58.950
been to you today.

29b0a537-c4c1-416c-b591-ac24cae4906f-0
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:05.220
In fact, if you watch the way your breath behaves, you can

29b0a537-c4c1-416c-b591-ac24cae4906f-1
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:10.350
know what's going to happen today, tomorrow and further.

17e17e6e-bb8e-46fa-a31a-018b774d3205-0
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.406
If you simply watch how your breath breath behaves within

17e17e6e-bb8e-46fa-a31a-018b774d3205-1
00:29:15.406 --> 00:29:19.594
you, you can clearly know what's happening with the system and

17e17e6e-bb8e-46fa-a31a-018b774d3205-2
00:29:19.594 --> 00:29:21.389
what is it heading towards.

51feaefd-6c05-4179-b6e9-0fe34089c483-0
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.074
Can I have tea or coffee after Shambhavi, or can I eat

51feaefd-6c05-4179-b6e9-0fe34089c483-1
00:29:34.074 --> 00:29:37.160
immediately after the practice?

137ea087-0d99-46c7-9893-1c4eaafd4c5b-0
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.954
If immediately after Shambhavi, whatever you consume, if it is

137ea087-0d99-46c7-9893-1c4eaafd4c5b-1
00:29:46.954 --> 00:29:52.637
either of room temperature or a bath, there is no problem about

137ea087-0d99-46c7-9893-1c4eaafd4c5b-2
00:29:52.637 --> 00:29:54.680
what you eat and drink.

8c697b92-f098-4755-b5cb-a7df353c1537-0
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.803
Coffee, Tea being a strong stimulant, it would be ideal to

8c697b92-f098-4755-b5cb-a7df353c1537-1
00:29:59.803 --> 00:30:03.779
give it a little break, at least
20 to 30 minutes break before

8c697b92-f098-4755-b5cb-a7df353c1537-2
00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:04.600
you drink it.

f9ace8c9-4b31-43d6-bc20-87832274ecc8-0
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.253
But even if you drink it immediately after sambhavi,

f9ace8c9-4b31-43d6-bc20-87832274ecc8-1
00:30:09.253 --> 00:30:13.076
there will be no harm as such, but it could dissipate the

f9ace8c9-4b31-43d6-bc20-87832274ecc8-2
00:30:13.076 --> 00:30:17.032
benefit you have gained because of nervous stimulation that

f9ace8c9-4b31-43d6-bc20-87832274ecc8-3
00:30:17.032 --> 00:30:18.680
these stimulants will do.

f5d42575-9537-407a-9559-b8c44088b68a-0
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.683
But if you do the kriya regularly, the need to stimulate

f5d42575-9537-407a-9559-b8c44088b68a-1
00:30:23.683 --> 00:30:26.240
your system from outside be taken away.

d0511e2d-8276-4f72-88f0-0665f5a49575-0
00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.200
You're sufficiently stimulated just by doing the kriya.

33aef32a-edee-49a3-af36-d59e95d4b917-0
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.520
This can be clearly experienced within a few weeks of practice.

18e1d1db-224d-4ef6-885d-b0d0e451b5cb-0
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:40.113
Sadhguru if I'm sick or I have a bad cold, should I stop doing

18e1d1db-224d-4ef6-885d-b0d0e451b5cb-1
00:30:40.113 --> 00:30:41.160
the kriya?

26c4768b-0c7b-45fd-88b8-4707beea5bb1-0
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:46.717
Sadhguru The kriya is a wonderful support for your

26c4768b-0c7b-45fd-88b8-4707beea5bb1-1
00:30:46.717 --> 00:30:47.480
system.

1683911d-467a-4be2-a162-9891db9a6543-0
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.708
It greatly enhances your health by supporting the energy system

1683911d-467a-4be2-a162-9891db9a6543-1
00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:54.600
in a big way.

5a525925-e95c-4397-9f9f-251637c83e2e-0
00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.337
So on a particular day, if you're not doing too well, is

5a525925-e95c-4397-9f9f-251637c83e2e-1
00:31:00.337 --> 00:31:03.140
that the day to remove the support?

49b625ce-06d3-4e0c-8a67-9484d07aea65-0
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.700
Definitely not.

cf6d6c98-e994-486f-b0fb-680882f23c20-0
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.180
So if you're sick, you must do it.

e6c2c83e-7d6d-42fe-9d02-9ea1509b464a-0
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.300
Maybe an extra kriya for the day.

1f4e423c-3458-47f7-bf1e-3797f56496b6-0
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.140
So if you have a cold, you must do it.

7e0bad0d-ca36-4491-beb5-595ee919b5b0-0
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.264
Only thing is, clearing up your nostrils could be a little bit

7e0bad0d-ca36-4491-beb5-595ee919b5b0-1
00:31:22.264 --> 00:31:23.760
of a struggle, sadhguru.

93a4b8f3-cee3-40f2-947e-db93fb73f539-0
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.360
Anyway, you will be struggling to do that when you have a cold.

886e5ea6-a290-4076-8f73-caaef2cff56a-0
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.840
It can be done.

9f5b8ac9-6cc8-4cc9-a2f5-e5815a5447c3-0
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.240
If you just use a little bit of Celine sprays or something.

66952882-36e3-4e18-a027-a4989918f1ea-0
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.000
You could do it.

7e586e01-d7ff-4576-b099-c608ec9f90cd-0
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.840
If you're doing the kriya regularly, this very often.

6a4b1927-598a-429b-8eef-3d06b63a5bb2-0
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.640
Catching cold, falling sick.

fee50837-c9e6-4111-8798-a26c3eb592f4-0
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.280
These things can disappear from your life.

a7608707-772a-4bf1-a779-07d2223eb3e3-0
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.640
Your sick leave may go waste.

d6f41939-a7bf-4d53-8622-a52b1278547b-0
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.305
That's OK with you, but you can always tell your boss something

d6f41939-a7bf-4d53-8622-a52b1278547b-1
00:31:54.305 --> 00:31:56.880
and take sick leave and have a picnic.

eb1daea0-07ff-4baa-95c3-6d68713724cb-0
00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:04.400
Sadhguru, if I'm in a hurry, can I reduce the practice time?

59ae4ccf-cfc9-4b2d-b89b-96b4e507f644-0
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.840
Can I do 3 to 4 minutes of shukhupranayam?

9be4770b-b78c-480e-8ccb-95ed4aa6d114-0
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.320
Reduce the breath watching time at the end.

148dc15d-58f5-4326-bd58-5466fa636477-0
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:19.776
So if you're in a hurry, if there is not enough time on your

148dc15d-58f5-4326-bd58-5466fa636477-1
00:32:19.776 --> 00:32:23.450
hands, you must get up little early.

0d34b01e-f691-4ff1-a784-34766a7b5bc3-0
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.066
You don't make any kind of modifications or innovations

0d34b01e-f691-4ff1-a784-34766a7b5bc3-1
00:32:30.066 --> 00:32:30.890
upon the tree.

b1e2f28a-dc7e-4de5-a0df-77404c8fee80-0
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.570
It's very very important.

c76b5ee3-609c-4bc2-b1d7-74cd14ce0fae-0
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:40.038
So instead of three bandas, instead of doing the neck lock,

c76b5ee3-609c-4bc2-b1d7-74cd14ce0fae-1
00:32:40.038 --> 00:32:44.905
diaphragm lock and inner lock, can I just do the anal lock

c76b5ee3-609c-4bc2-b1d7-74cd14ce0fae-2
00:32:44.905 --> 00:32:47.050
instead of the other ones?

40f181f1-1099-4b0d-8a9a-72db3f778c01-0
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:52.410
Don't make such *******
innovations, OK?

32527e1f-8112-4430-8cd1-89e73e4d9478-0
00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:02.283
This is an internal science which has been a very distilled

32527e1f-8112-4430-8cd1-89e73e4d9478-1
00:33:02.283 --> 00:33:08.076
essence of it is being given to you based on that, You just

32527e1f-8112-4430-8cd1-89e73e4d9478-2
00:33:08.076 --> 00:33:10.489
learn to benefit from it.

426330c9-6eac-48a9-a196-5f4fa47c5214-0
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:16.744
You don't try to do something else with it, so you don't try

426330c9-6eac-48a9-a196-5f4fa47c5214-1
00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:19.410
to make any modifications.

5b7ed9f7-79c1-47db-9a29-13dc05156f6d-0
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.630
I don't have enough time.

71a6e1e5-41f6-4802-9afe-d8ea2de492be-0
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.070
It's not true.

df080310-5886-4ef4-bfcb-cd5e7069d6bc-0
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.030
You don't have enough commitment.

aee4f9bc-6eb8-48d8-95c3-94514d540639-0
00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:25.990
That is the truth.

ce3f08de-9823-49fd-a8bd-c9ee765011b3-0
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.216
If you understand how significant it is, you will find

ce3f08de-9823-49fd-a8bd-c9ee765011b3-1
00:33:32.216 --> 00:33:32.630
time.

b2664cf1-7e3e-4bfe-8f15-79d0af24931a-0
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:38.310
So 40 days, twice a day.

1385e103-99da-41c7-8750-a567a474d994-0
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.590
You will do it six months at least.

713dde6c-d7b5-42d8-a828-a1bb89b7a1da-0
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.910
Once a day you must do it.

aa4db8a9-5335-4091-a41d-ca1ecea905ca-0
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.150
Otherwise, I'll come and bother you.

864f781d-679b-42dd-b10a-94b7e0953b2f-0
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.150
After that you will anyway do it.

3d1c9076-5c2a-483d-9705-e3bfa58e2447-0
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.910
By then you will know what it is doing to you.

51ee7214-4c63-461d-9587-3c0a235118b0-0
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:01.694
So these questions do not start something, do not start

51ee7214-4c63-461d-9587-3c0a235118b0-1
00:34:01.694 --> 00:34:05.870
something that could be immensely valuable to you.

a7df5af9-da95-4b55-9c02-426bdca4e40a-0
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:12.171
With this whole strategy of how not to do it, 21 minutes is an

a7df5af9-da95-4b55-9c02-426bdca4e40a-1
00:34:12.171 --> 00:34:17.163
investment that you make to enhance your life and it will

a7df5af9-da95-4b55-9c02-426bdca4e40a-2
00:34:17.163 --> 00:34:22.241
pay off in a big way, very big way bigger than the way you

a7df5af9-da95-4b55-9c02-426bdca4e40a-3
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:26.200
understand right now to make that investment.

a9c1a432-f030-42be-b164-a4a4fd02f5f9-0
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.440
If you don't make an investment, there will be no dividend.

05e47453-0586-49a1-8c5e-93e5dbb49ee4-0
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.040
It's as simple as that.

c5ee4af9-4c8e-4185-b53a-26faa69872e0-0
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.008
If I skip the practice on one of the days, should I restart the

c5ee4af9-4c8e-4185-b53a-26faa69872e0-1
00:34:43.008 --> 00:34:43.440
40 days?

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.560
Sadhguru, you won't wake up the next day.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.733
If you miss it one day, you won't wake up the next day,

So if I miss my practice one day, should I restart my 40

42b94853-e271-400b-b7c7-60fc90398344-1
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.040
days?

00:35:26.287 --> 00:35:29.250

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:37.012
If you can't create 21 minutes in a day the way you want it,

6978e55f-a942-42b7-9d68-d892bffbdea5-1
00:35:37.012 --> 00:35:40.130

It'll work.

0db82416-9015-42ef-a21b-bdf817bccfdf-0

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:39.550

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:19.450
Now it is ideal to have a bath or shower just before you start

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.550
your practices.

water is also fine.

If you're having a bath and then you do your practices, then you

4a5e2ef6-4a7b-4b4c-86d3-1ef9ec358d6d-1

00:38:57.576 --> 00:38:58.720

00:39:10.856 --> 00:39:14.390
then you have to wait for 30
minutes before you ingest them.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.950
You may notice that the creas create some heat in the body as

74588a1c-0131-4896-b571-d4fd4a5b77a4-1
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.150
it is very purifying in nature.

ee5be2d1-02ec-4974-b856-4ec9cea3d487-0
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:26.712
So if you put something cold immediately after then it will

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:52.190
You can do it gently and make sure that you're not causing any

2da35f3e-974c-41ec-9b4a-8fad42612f45-1
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.229
discomfort to the system, especially when bringing the

00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:15.110
minimum, meaning you just lock it and then you come out of it.

2b878641-4dca-48ac-bef8-da614958aff7-0
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.985
The preparatory asanas will strengthen the pelvic region and

00:40:19.985 --> 00:40:22.310

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.684
In fact, when you travel, you have all the time in the world,

00:40:34.684 --> 00:40:35.060
isn't it?

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.841

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.913
In some airports you can find meditation rooms or otherwise a

8a69bbe7-5d47-43e5-9ed7-79c099df259d-1
00:40:57.913 --> 00:40:59.340
quiet corner will do.

766fc9a6-f4a4-436e-8da4-f8240e098405-0
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.614
If you're on a flight or train or bus where there's no space

766fc9a6-f4a4-436e-8da4-f8240e098405-1
00:41:04.614 --> 00:41:09.254
for you to do the preparatory as soon as, then just for this you

766fc9a6-f4a4-436e-8da4-f8240e098405-2
00:41:09.254 --> 00:41:09.540
can.

87d0aedd-98fd-4387-83a1-f91c8128ed3e-0
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.267
For this particular case, you can make an exception and you

87d0aedd-98fd-4387-83a1-f91c8128ed3e-1
00:41:14.267 --> 00:41:17.900
skip the preparatory steps and do the Shambhavi.

70f496e2-bb42-4f6b-b2cb-dce5bd02e5c3-0
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.180
Only the Shambhavi Mahamudra, yes.

4d9c5b2a-c8bd-45b5-81e0-e27fc5c80ea6-0
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.186
And if you're unable to sit in other you can sit with your legs

4d9c5b2a-c8bd-45b5-81e0-e27fc5c80ea6-1
00:41:26.186 --> 00:41:30.487
crossed at the ankle, right ankle over the left ankle and

4d9c5b2a-c8bd-45b5-81e0-e27fc5c80ea6-2
00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:35.085
you use the back rest of the seat only to rest the lower part

4d9c5b2a-c8bd-45b5-81e0-e27fc5c80ea6-3
00:41:35.085 --> 00:41:38.200
of the body of the back and do the clear.

13b89e70-e223-49d3-8090-432c9219eb2b-0
00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.780
If you're doing any kind of exercise, it is best to do the

13b89e70-e223-49d3-8090-432c9219eb2b-1
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.298
exercise 1st and rest your body to a point where your breath and

13b89e70-e223-49d3-8090-432c9219eb2b-2
00:41:49.298 --> 00:41:53.330
your system comes to normal and then you do the practice.

7419262b-ac33-4a74-b13f-13bcd2c23019-0
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.530
If you exercise, take a shower and then sit for the Korea, that

7419262b-ac33-4a74-b13f-13bcd2c23019-1
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.639
will be the best way to do it, but not essentially so if your

7419262b-ac33-4a74-b13f-13bcd2c23019-2
00:42:02.639 --> 00:42:06.482
lifestyle is such that once you come out of your bedroom,

7419262b-ac33-4a74-b13f-13bcd2c23019-3
00:42:06.482 --> 00:42:10.657
there's every chance that you might get entangled with so many

7419262b-ac33-4a74-b13f-13bcd2c23019-4
00:42:10.657 --> 00:42:11.850
things around you.

9497d3df-146e-40c4-ac97-52c00385bddf-0
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:17.966
So if that is the case, it is best that first you do the Korea

9497d3df-146e-40c4-ac97-52c00385bddf-1
00:42:17.966 --> 00:42:22.763
and then whether exercise happened or not, it doesn't

9497d3df-146e-40c4-ac97-52c00385bddf-2
00:42:22.763 --> 00:42:28.181
matter if you're on a regular medication, please continue to

9497d3df-146e-40c4-ac97-52c00385bddf-3
00:42:28.181 --> 00:42:29.070
take them.

ed906612-ed03-439a-9572-3c88bd3abe71-0
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:32.765
Just because that you have started doing yoga, you should

ed906612-ed03-439a-9572-3c88bd3abe71-1
00:42:32.765 --> 00:42:36.504
not stop your medication all of the sudden as you continue doing

ed906612-ed03-439a-9572-3c88bd3abe71-2
00:42:36.504 --> 00:42:39.150
your practice and you notice some difference.

44e65d32-0408-4259-85de-96331080bfa7-0
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.357
Then you can consult your doctor and gradually you can either

44e65d32-0408-4259-85de-96331080bfa7-1
00:42:43.357 --> 00:42:45.910
reduce or stop it only as per his advice.

guide you on how to go about the practices.

cfde781e-de35-47d5-8852-6e085950a358-0
00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:01.018
It is also important that you do the Shambhavi Mahamudir Kriya

cfde781e-de35-47d5-8852-6e085950a358-1
00:43:01.018 --> 00:43:05.468
just the way it is instructed to you without any modification and

cfde781e-de35-47d5-8852-6e085950a358-2
00:43:05.468 --> 00:43:06.210
distortion.

510a9747-1c3a-4288-a109-a665a304fa38-0
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.810
It takes a tremendous understanding of the system to

510a9747-1c3a-4288-a109-a665a304fa38-1
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:13.410
design A practice like this and offer it.

131b3a46-bbf2-4285-aafd-527643816903-0
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.276
It has come to us through Sadhguru's profound

131b3a46-bbf2-4285-aafd-527643816903-1
00:43:17.276 --> 00:43:20.927
understanding of the human mechanism, so it is important

131b3a46-bbf2-4285-aafd-527643816903-2
00:43:20.927 --> 00:43:24.130
that you just do it the way it is offered to you.

5e299ec3-92f2-4bc9-b6e7-4dd0fd5eb4dd-0
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:31.064
Also, ensure that you ensure not to do the practice of the

5e299ec3-92f2-4bc9-b6e7-4dd0fd5eb4dd-1
00:43:31.064 --> 00:43:34.930
flattering or the locks outside of the practice.

3240356d-104d-4875-bc9e-6ebdb4aa55c2-0
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:39.769
This should only be done as part of the practice, but you can

3240356d-104d-4875-bc9e-6ebdb4aa55c2-1
00:43:39.769 --> 00:43:43.530
practice Sukka Kriya and I'm chanting independently.

7a0f6dd3-443d-4a46-9b70-7a109607a08e-0
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:49.073
This Both the Suga Kriya and the arm chanting are the only two

7a0f6dd3-443d-4a46-9b70-7a109607a08e-1
00:43:49.073 --> 00:43:52.180
parts of the practice that can be done alone.

4bc16099-d8d6-459f-85fc-0f6628c74902-0
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.714
Especially for those who suffers from any kind of anxiety,

4bc16099-d8d6-459f-85fc-0f6628c74902-1
00:43:57.714 --> 00:44:01.060
depression, excessive fears, nightmares.

4f15a1c1-e12a-43ed-ab22-a4f96f3c3f10-0
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.992
It will be a huge support to do Suga kriya and arm chanting for

4f15a1c1-e12a-43ed-ab22-a4f96f3c3f10-1
00:44:04.992 --> 00:44:05.820
longer periods.

44f95c4f-5c86-4989-a40c-7d6c9330ac22-0
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.909
You can do Suga Kriya for 12
minutes followed by arm chanting

44f95c4f-5c86-4989-a40c-7d6c9330ac22-1
00:44:10.909 --> 00:44:14.140
for 12 minutes three to five times a day.

75c99b70-a331-4278-b340-2fa37fc3bb44-0
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.180
But this doesn't replace Shambhavi.

3c4bb640-5544-4ecc-87f5-a177c0f8c25a-0
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.340
Shambhavi still has to happen.

d5056451-b544-4885-af8a-9329c73cc97c-0

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.846
In case during the initiation process, audio, video, something

52b25b60-f477-422c-a5cf-d0eb4ff6d965-1
00:52:27.846 --> 00:52:31.468
goes away, you don't bother, you discontinue the practice because

52b25b60-f477-422c-a5cf-d0eb4ff6d965-2
00:52:31.468 --> 00:52:32.950
we would have described it.

639ec98f-dc56-4dab-8214-678505d827bf-0
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.710
You just keep the same focus and continue.

2b93c72b-d914-4484-9167-6a901b570367-0
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:38.390
No need to open your eyes and try to fix it.

aafc6dfd-dc2e-4556-8692-ac58c8eab80b-0
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:43.911
And also about the completion form that she was mentioning,

aafc6dfd-dc2e-4556-8692-ac58c8eab80b-1
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:49.080
the system is designed in such a way that unless you fill the

aafc6dfd-dc2e-4556-8692-ac58c8eab80b-2
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:54.249
completion form and file it, it doesn't record you as someone

aafc6dfd-dc2e-4556-8692-ac58c8eab80b-3
00:52:54.249 --> 00:52:56.750
who has completed the program.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:58.550
So it'll keep you out of the system.

8779ff28-aa2b-43ef-b099-47c9fbfb3e6c-0
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:03.868
So make sure that you put the completion form so that the

8779ff28-aa2b-43ef-b099-47c9fbfb3e6c-1
00:53:03.868 --> 00:53:08.270
system recognizes that you've done the program.

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:13.715
Otherwise, if you come here, they'll ask you so many

795dd575-23c9-41a6-ac18-f897da82871b-1
00:53:13.715 --> 00:53:17.390
questions just to avoid that for you.

acaef0a5-ccba-4531-bc61-6935bcc7f9ef-0
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:28.232
Well, when it comes to anything that is transformative, when it

acaef0a5-ccba-4531-bc61-6935bcc7f9ef-1
00:53:28.232 --> 00:53:35.514
comes to any powerful process, it's extremely important how you

acaef0a5-ccba-4531-bc61-6935bcc7f9ef-2
00:53:35.514 --> 00:53:42.568
receive it and it is equally important from where you receive

acaef0a5-ccba-4531-bc61-6935bcc7f9ef-3
00:53:42.568 --> 00:53:42.910
it.

dfdf5174-96a2-4696-be4d-d5c236ca114a-0
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:50.888
Sadhguru, first of all let us look at how you receive it as in

dfdf5174-96a2-4696-be4d-d5c236ca114a-1
00:53:50.888 --> 00:53:55.030
many ways we've been see, you must understand this.

f23094f4-fd83-4c7f-a9ff-e6d60203e1fe-0
00:53:55.270 --> 00:54:01.657
The whole program, over 28 to 30
hours of program is structured

f23094f4-fd83-4c7f-a9ff-e6d60203e1fe-1
00:54:01.657 --> 00:54:05.550
just to give you a 21 minute practice.

af3618c8-0c03-458a-b345-6183510a55b9-0
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:13.252
To teach a 21 minute practice in
42 minutes we must be able to do

af3618c8-0c03-458a-b345-6183510a55b9-1
00:54:13.252 --> 00:54:17.430
it or at least in an hour we must be able to do it.

51d753d8-267d-45ff-9905-61d8827cca1e-0
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.830
Why 30 hours of program?

863003b5-f6b8-4eab-b043-9b835cadb512-0
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:21.550
Because it's important.

317b2f68-12c2-4ebf-be60-8ae3fcef21f2-0
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.706
It is extremely important that you receive it the right way

317b2f68-12c2-4ebf-be60-8ae3fcef21f2-1
00:54:25.706 --> 00:54:30.097
because depending upon when it comes to subjective aspects, how

317b2f68-12c2-4ebf-be60-8ae3fcef21f2-2
00:54:30.097 --> 00:54:32.430
you receive it is very important.

195d58ab-e702-4506-8ea3-c5b50d0c9a6b-0
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:35.390
Whichever way you receive it, that's the way it becomes.

7bc7af7e-b560-4ed0-a5b8-3d00a3e182d2-0
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.390
You have seen if you have two children at home, Oregon.

48862a87-dc47-4aff-9820-edd869c43849-0
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:42.541
If you yourself had siblings, same genetics, sadhguru, same

48862a87-dc47-4aff-9820-edd869c43849-1
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:44.340
food probably same school.

da566957-5529-4e0a-8232-10e041db9b97-0
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.540
One goes like this.

9ecdc397-1980-4e03-99a4-6c5ae63fcda7-0
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.740
Another shoots like this.

82c6853e-7c2d-4ad7-87fb-66559eea003e-0
00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:47.860
Hello.

55225bea-7db9-40a4-acac-ec72c4e05c02-0
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.620
Happening or not, you can't recognize.

9fe156a4-e77b-4fc9-be39-56a0c28b8814-0
00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.540
Are these my children?

3d0aace1-59a2-4482-9920-bc2e411ca522-0
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:54.100
Yes.

4bfdaa72-7f02-4292-aee2-05874b419720-0
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.947
Lot of parents looking at their children like this because they

4bfdaa72-7f02-4292-aee2-05874b419720-1
00:54:56.947 --> 00:54:57.500
can't believe.

ee40f4d3-d116-4070-9614-c3452e337be4-0
00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:58.780
Did I produce this one?

bfddf3f5-1852-4aba-b3e8-541dc963a3fb-0
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.460
Because it's about how they receive it.

27c85fe8-736b-4d24-8de6-1a0054813728-0
00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.081
What they receive is also important, but how they receive

27c85fe8-736b-4d24-8de6-1a0054813728-1
00:55:11.081 --> 00:55:12.580
it is equally important.

ac2fdf0c-0ed8-42b3-9fd2-dd656295a755-0
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:18.283
When I say how the reason why for ages they maintained

ac2fdf0c-0ed8-42b3-9fd2-dd656295a755-1
00:55:18.283 --> 00:55:24.126
intimate atmospheres before it is given is because to fix how

ac2fdf0c-0ed8-42b3-9fd2-dd656295a755-2
00:55:24.126 --> 00:55:25.540
you receive it.

c3d2da2e-22ac-48d3-8aa1-f3e5c197c3ce-0
00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:30.808
We believe in these thousands of years you have your volatile

c3d2da2e-22ac-48d3-8aa1-f3e5c197c3ce-1
00:55:30.808 --> 00:55:31.140
point.

5f928b6f-ed69-4f61-a438-ade69288403c-0
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:35.162
If you are told this is the way to receive it, you will get the

5f928b6f-ed69-4f61-a438-ade69288403c-1
00:55:35.162 --> 00:55:36.860
instruction 1000 years ago.

d86e3ef7-afda-4801-a885-41a7b7944b27-0
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.790
Tell that man or woman this is the way.

4c50ce7e-295b-4a78-ba36-68c0f19b4f5a-0
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:42.870
Was very difficult to make them understand.

1f2bf530-372c-40cd-926e-6c966a21f4fe-0
00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.430
We believe you have your wall to a place.

6c97f360-6b6c-4d30-b88b-2d442ea3400c-0
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:48.945
We can tell you this is the way and that is the way you will do

6c97f360-6b6c-4d30-b88b-2d442ea3400c-1
00:55:48.945 --> 00:55:49.110
it.

6123af7a-dee1-46da-a49c-3a5c690abcab-0
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:50.070
Can I trust you?

75a38814-d649-4aae-b442-f3c2a79d351f-0
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.870
All of you all over the country.

7b9352d1-e2f3-4a36-b95b-0830cfff94d2-0
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:56.630
Online this happened.

1b76556f-5d23-4bd3-8652-4a16adcf5ef8-0
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.470
You have definitely heard about Akbar and Birbal.

0c42424e-a554-48e2-97e5-59194129e4e8-0
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.230
Hmm.

a80ee9d1-d030-405c-905b-203acafab1b2-0
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.990
Akbar and Birbal.

7e8d8d82-74a5-4caa-ab6f-7bfe8bac9ab0-0
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.488
You heard Akbar's name is written all over the place

7e8d8d82-74a5-4caa-ab6f-7bfe8bac9ab0-1
00:56:08.488 --> 00:56:11.260
because kings and emperors are like this.

462d4766-f7e9-4733-9c39-4042b8a15f5f-0
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.140
Their names are written in every page of the history book.

bc93aae1-7b25-479c-9053-3db96617c7a0-0
00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.140
Because they sponsor the historians.

ed861df1-c122-48fd-ad4a-7a9653339ea5-0
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.980
Yes, but nobody mentions a minister's name.

a48fa020-2358-43be-9b93-b7db34c21366-0
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:27.580
But Birbal's name is not written in history.

2520f591-d0ae-4aeb-9399-9047921b7014-0
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:32.380
But he enshrined himself in every Indian's heart out of his

2520f591-d0ae-4aeb-9399-9047921b7014-1
00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.500
wit and wisdom.

8f74d8d0-24a1-4cfb-b74a-9517302b2374-0
00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:34.780
You can't ignore him.

9615e3d2-7841-4ced-bd2f-eb5589ecf7e3-0
00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.180
So this happened.

09503889-370e-4ae5-90e9-507a8939de23-0
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:44.756
It once happened on a certain day Akbar decided to visit

09503889-370e-4ae5-90e9-507a8939de23-1
00:56:44.756 --> 00:56:50.300
Birbal because in the course of years he is not only his right

09503889-370e-4ae5-90e9-507a8939de23-2
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.820
hand man but also become a dear friend.

0b6b0d3f-91f3-4900-a708-f95aa2b48e7d-0
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:02.650
You cannot help being drawn to a man like Birbal Sadhguru.

327a158e-a61c-4069-8e4e-80e337caab80-0
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:05.932
Even though Akbar tried to maintain his dignity of being an

327a158e-a61c-4069-8e4e-80e337caab80-1
00:57:05.932 --> 00:57:07.410
emperor, slowly he yielded.

b57363bd-05c5-4e23-93ec-c71b5e719c6c-0
00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:12.370
So one day he wanted to see him.

4a44eb92-f718-40fb-b815-a9372e7e2fe4-0
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:14.530
So he walked into Birbal's house.

c0d157c5-1dd3-41e2-a1db-9ca48764d7d0-0
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.770
See, an emperor usually doesn't go visiting.

4765c2b2-6b28-48ad-8469-c4a21374f2b8-0
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.650
Everybody comes to visit him.

af58bc08-42ff-4786-8229-a4bfff883310-0
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:22.690
He doesn't go visiting anybody.

eb1b24c0-ccc5-408b-9af0-fce98d64d46d-0
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:27.090
But today the Emperor walked into Birbal's house.

a263060d-6382-4e04-99e0-ce6da6eec9e9-0
00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:32.148
Early morning, Birbal's wife saw Sadhguru, the Emperor, walking

a263060d-6382-4e04-99e0-ce6da6eec9e9-1
00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:33.250
into the house.

17fa7ef4-c910-439e-b1b0-9e697b260483-0
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:39.042
If the Emperor walks into your house, it could be a great

17fa7ef4-c910-439e-b1b0-9e697b260483-1
00:57:39.042 --> 00:57:39.610
fortune.

56210535-671e-4823-83f3-166932549d17-0
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:42.530
Or maybe today you're going to lose your head.

ab348059-b7ed-46bc-8bd7-1c86f2822f84-0
00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:43.970
You don't know what's coming.

793fc58b-ecb3-4fa5-b26a-f4bee25e5a48-0
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:49.454
So she does not know why he is coming like this into her house

793fc58b-ecb3-4fa5-b26a-f4bee25e5a48-1
00:57:49.454 --> 00:57:50.210
unannounced.

0471a548-9dbf-45bb-8562-132940cb480b-0
00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:52.450
No security, no protocol.

347959c6-05b3-4f37-9b69-6bb89bfc1293-0
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:53.810
Just the man is coming.

8dc014d3-de64-41e3-a51e-b4e2e84fefad-0
00:57:56.170 --> 00:58:00.291
So she made him sit down and then she apologized and said

8dc014d3-de64-41e3-a51e-b4e2e84fefad-1
00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:04.769
Beerbil won't be able to see you right now because he is doing

8dc014d3-de64-41e3-a51e-b4e2e84fefad-2
00:58:04.769 --> 00:58:05.479
his Jappa.

96b1ab95-69ba-42d4-899c-4e55082f6e67-0
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.440
Akbar got irritated.

dd3187da-b7e5-442f-9353-c3f0a74107b6-0
00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.760
What is this Jappa that he cannot see me?

112118e8-ae35-4273-828f-fddbbf593b95-0
00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.200
I come to his house, I'm the emperor.

78c03c34-8193-4a37-98e0-4932cf7c7a75-0
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.880
I come to his house and he cannot see me.

e6645290-1b1b-4fec-80dd-69971368b0a1-0
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.960
See if Beerbil's wife had said he is in the toilet.

214fbd6d-c718-4288-aa46-f36a90e43df1-0
00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.160
Akbar understands these matters very well.

4ca3142b-00aa-4e63-88cf-622f35efbc31-0
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.340
But what is this Jappa?

4bee727c-cc07-4996-b798-eb6fecfa5131-0
00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:33.540
He got irritated then he sat down anyway.

10035a53-d6dd-4fb6-a7da-62ce3353af13-0
00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:40.697
One minute, 2 minutes, 3
minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes,

10035a53-d6dd-4fb6-a7da-62ce3353af13-1
00:58:40.697 --> 00:58:41.940
25 minutes.

109b8592-dc34-4662-a706-59bf9d1fc652-0
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.340
By now Akbar was in a rage.

79626ad7-d39a-4e93-8170-785a2dd9e5f7-0
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.436
But this good lady, Birbal's wife, she's going all about

79626ad7-d39a-4e93-8170-785a2dd9e5f7-1
00:58:51.436 --> 00:58:54.340
trying to give this, trying to give that to him.

4ff2e924-a42f-494c-aef5-6448b453a2e3-0
00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.370
He doesn't want to sadhguru really your friend?

04328e86-8fe2-44a8-bc9c-19979f49746e-0
00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:01.702
He has nothing against her but he is in a total rage because 25

04328e86-8fe2-44a8-bc9c-19979f49746e-1
00:59:01.702 --> 00:59:05.966
minutes he kept me waiting when I've come to his house for the

04328e86-8fe2-44a8-bc9c-19979f49746e-2
00:59:05.966 --> 00:59:07.050
very first time.

ce413caf-94cb-44bf-80c9-f0081d7a7d73-0
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:13.721
Then Birbal came profusely, apologized and said if you had

ce413caf-94cb-44bf-80c9-f0081d7a7d73-1
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:17.570
only told me, I would have been ready for you.

7398f2d5-8012-4cc0-bda4-545ccad2765a-0
00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:21.509
It's just that in the morning when I'm doing my Jappa, no

7398f2d5-8012-4cc0-bda4-545ccad2765a-1
00:59:21.509 --> 00:59:24.850
matter what happens, I cannot break it once I start it.

88d3379b-c5d4-4555-a485-d9ec828c2c30-0
00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:31.740
I'm very sorry, Akbar asked.

d6fee3cd-a32c-4c29-9b8e-c98c7ed99e7b-0
00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.500
What is this damn chapa that you risked your life just now?

23b625df-7205-430a-9243-17bb62b91fc7-0
00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:37.780
You put your life on the line.

b1fc71a6-3631-485b-ae57-e883150aa4b5-0
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.940
What is this chapa?

90c0a79a-f893-4e61-b53c-a06a72e350ca-0
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.460
What do you get out of it?

7ea0384f-272d-49f9-839c-f472b5e317fd-0
00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.100
So Bhirbul said.

db8cd416-a6e9-4be2-92ae-5e3bbfad5a75-0
00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:48.398
This is a simple process that's been given to me by my by my

db8cd416-a6e9-4be2-92ae-5e3bbfad5a75-1
00:59:48.398 --> 00:59:49.330
guru Sadhguru.

857b25d8-1d41-4218-b011-1584823a1d0a-0
00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:50.650
Once I start, I don't stop.

1e70bdf7-2efc-4df2-851f-2ba04baeffab-0
00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:55.296
Last last 40 years I've been practicing this without a single

1e70bdf7-2efc-4df2-851f-2ba04baeffab-1
00:59:55.296 --> 00:59:59.632
day's break and because of that these are all the benefits I

1e70bdf7-2efc-4df2-851f-2ba04baeffab-2
00:59:59.632 --> 01:00:00.770
have in my life.

dde92f1c-4714-4848-bb5c-236622740f00-0
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:06.317
Akbar listened to all this and said what all this happened to

dde92f1c-4714-4848-bb5c-236622740f00-1
01:00:06.317 --> 01:00:06.570
you.

49f87681-698d-4225-a20c-3466fbcbb36f-0
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.890
Because of this Jappa teach me the Jappa.

58e38fe7-2abc-491a-81a1-16b9571cbdf9-0
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:13.330
I will also do it, Mirbul said.

8e5ef833-2303-4eb3-aeb3-6bf1fb43144f-0
01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:15.970
I am not the person to teach it to you.

dafdcf45-8e5e-4bab-ba64-8598ef66d966-0
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.530
You must receive it from the right source.

32206f2b-c3ea-46e3-86ec-681e09bb0cb9-0
01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:24.730
If you want, I'll make arrangements, MacBook said.

f0b312b3-9a6a-4d7b-9a93-32af49ce7934-0
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:30.406
What, You've been practicing for
40 years and you can't teach it

f0b312b3-9a6a-4d7b-9a93-32af49ce7934-1
01:00:30.406 --> 01:00:30.930
to me.

382da4e4-f9c1-451c-8cc3-e64932dacb63-0
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:32.290
What is that nonsense?

f33cd766-62d9-4108-a039-6bf3e8e4d22b-0
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:38.690
I want to learn the Japan now, teach me now, Bhirwul said.

3f88b3a0-8cf8-4330-bf6b-8796f4c5fd9a-0
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:42.290
See, this is not within my ambit of doing things.

76d5d0b2-7484-4506-a0ec-e94a46fab6f4-0
01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.170
I cannot teach you these things.

de3acc00-ea28-49a1-80bf-74e380e04edd-0
01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:47.646
I will make all the arrangements so that you will receive it from

de3acc00-ea28-49a1-80bf-74e380e04edd-1
01:00:47.646 --> 01:00:48.490
the right source.

8352d58e-2524-4a0c-9ea0-31e2357c8463-0
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.580
Akbar got Akbar got really mad.

037c3b01-c2b3-4f8d-9882-7fc85ed7a825-0
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.980
You and your Hindu nonsense.

f23ae335-369a-4f27-a7c2-5296f6765e89-0
01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.380
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

851f5589-441b-4aea-90c4-b00eb799f297-0
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.100
So he went back to his palace, called his Secret Service, said

851f5589-441b-4aea-90c4-b00eb799f297-1
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.740
go and find out who are all doing Japan in this town.

ec901e78-f9ba-4e64-ac2c-010f8f92c477-0
01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.700
Catch them and bring them.

bcb5dd1a-2c54-4cf5-ad09-14926194675d-0
01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.940
They brought hundreds of people.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.620
He threatened each one of them and asked what is your mantra?

b5f1ee35-13c8-465f-b46c-74ac7626edde-0
01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.100

bee7f7ae-0f03-460e-8208-f81449cb34ba-0
01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.980
Fearing for life, all of them blurted out their mantras.

e1b54f8e-f3ec-43d1-a000-ba61f5a82ca7-0
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.890
He gathered A heap of mantras.

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:23.812
He cross checked, investigated and found out what is Birbal's

19e8b50f-f6c8-429a-91c7-dc09ab21b6ff-1
01:01:23.812 --> 01:01:24.210
mantra.

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:27.370
Then he asked Birbal to come.

6b3a484a-347f-45ec-a66e-eba01b62bb76-0
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:32.330
Birbal came as Birbal was walking into the room loudly.

38f82c82-a8a1-42d9-973b-acb8cf9926fe-0
01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:37.210
Akbar chanted the mantra and then asked Birbal, is this your

38f82c82-a8a1-42d9-973b-acb8cf9926fe-1
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:37.770
mantra?

c96b12ab-f067-45bf-84fa-7a23de6ead33-0
01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:40.530
Birbal said yes.

043c90cb-b931-427e-844a-0f645bdfecf8-0
01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.170
Sadhguru, is my pronunciation correct, Sadhguru?

1e7803dd-683b-46c6-955a-5cb7eb6f6c08-0
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:45.650
She said yes.

Hmm.

19fb7188-fe9e-4228-9e96-744cfafc10d7-0
01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.170
You refuse to give it to me.

66556061-3860-42ae-b6f1-a8511ae2ac61-0
01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:52.210
I got the mantra in my own way.

00f07950-c2ed-48a4-9c1c-9fe361011d68-0
01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:58.113
You watch me do the jappa, I will get more benefits than you,

00f07950-c2ed-48a4-9c1c-9fe361011d68-1
01:01:58.113 --> 01:01:59.210
Birbal said.

b7e5cf94-8df8-44bd-8625-21988291058a-0
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:02.050
What you have done is not wise.

0f51aa59-c5db-4299-a5ed-29c3768a01a3-0
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.810
This Jappa has transformed my life completely.

8e03e447-130c-4ebc-be01-26ff00c7c307-0
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:12.166
You must understand what has the power to transform you also has

01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:15.250
the power to destroy you if you mishandle it.

23109630-3e6b-4bb8-ad25-360da9e66470-0
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:17.910
Sadhguru, this is not the way to do it.

8d3b32de-9931-475a-a7eb-ae0d1c264673-0
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:20.030

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:26.550
TCH, Akbar said.

c3c0f91c-2512-4d88-ab60-ef58aa4eca02-0
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.630
Leave all this nonsense.

f6850078-936f-4e52-802b-2f3d92b3f273-0
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:28.990
I know how to do this Chapa.

511152b2-cb29-4841-8b22-f1e4c3f1dd95-0
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:30.110
Now I'm going to do it.

2460ad66-9d1c-4954-9d4d-a24a23f2818a-0
01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:31.350
Get more benefit than you.

be620b03-a1e7-40c7-8fac-e5cab706beec-0
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.310
You just watch me.

e7374bc5-f12a-4f29-8f1f-1a11320821ce-0
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.870
Nothing to say.

62df1de9-36fc-437f-8df0-17cafe2c9d31-0
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:37.790
Birbal left it after some time.

e805d994-d05f-441a-b096-889363644cd9-0
01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:41.086
One day, Akbar and Birbal were sitting and handling some

e805d994-d05f-441a-b096-889363644cd9-1
01:02:41.086 --> 01:02:42.070
matters of state.

012fbb83-9913-4dda-b981-fda542dfc5b2-0
01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.923
Suddenly beer Beer will call call the God who was at the

012fbb83-9913-4dda-b981-fda542dfc5b2-1
01:02:46.923 --> 01:02:47.220
door.

0435c6aa-9d42-48c7-91da-00c8980efce5-0
01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.180
The God came running.

ebf9ce3c-8a92-4673-a0d9-10fea5cea487-0
01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.940
He told the God, pointing towards Akbar.

14370c04-6c04-4e4e-9789-6744abbd1f10-0
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.460
Arrest this man and throw him in the dungeons.

9cb91557-2746-439e-a659-2ec681fb70d8-0
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.060
The God looked at the emperor.

b4e80ee2-f985-4164-a011-50a6af4cf26c-0
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.700
How can he lay his hands upon the emperor?

f00cf294-5929-4ea7-97e0-34b55152b078-0
01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.020
And now the chief minister is giving the order.

9e895c64-2b2a-47f8-90f5-eef84be9f27c-0
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.580
How to disregard it?

fb69368b-087f-4688-b5ab-edb6172faf7e-0
01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.460
Not knowing what to do, he started trembling with fear.

341d0210-8117-4b96-8d50-ed07ccb017d6-0
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:17.470
Looking at this situation, Akbar flew into a rage.

c64275d4-418c-4214-a045-8516d9dc4b58-0
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:23.110
He said, You fool, you're asking my personal God to arrest me.

c746d179-d876-4ff1-b04d-f03263cdb37a-0
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.910
He told the God take this fool and put him in the prison.

96d17bed-fa40-4e79-bf56-dec863118981-0
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:28.110
I'll take care of him later.

5fb8e5b4-a240-47f3-9074-48443ad428fe-0
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:34.676
So the God got hold of Birbul and started dragging him out of

5fb8e5b4-a240-47f3-9074-48443ad428fe-1
01:03:34.676 --> 01:03:35.270
the room.

92e4a7cd-3beb-4e56-ab22-605ba678c4cd-0
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:38.470
Birbul started laughing loudly.

18a122b4-e35e-4076-ac1f-10036e1b6f37-0
01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:39.870
He said.

148911f2-4d47-405e-a24e-2362c6a1f206-0
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:43.290
See, I gave the same order.

752e1698-0581-41f6-a9a4-57fe0bbead6f-0
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.130
See what happened.

a28b7888-ea5f-4876-aac5-37ddb59b4db5-0
01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:45.730
You gave the same order.

500eb4fb-c39b-49da-a201-31752ba34aab-0
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:46.610
See what happened?

352009b9-7da3-49b1-b904-18865d2545ab-0
01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:50.050
I told you you must receive the mantra from the right source.

7daba95a-ee80-42d5-b530-43f3d6a022c9-0
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.490
So it's very important from where you receive it.

e1fa58ba-6c64-411c-adaf-e4f4db964b66-0
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:01.050
This has been on for thousands and thousands of years.

0c43b4ad-8261-475d-9e89-17f16ec3f84b-0
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:08.543
To keep the the seed of Shambhavi in a sacred condition

0c43b4ad-8261-475d-9e89-17f16ec3f84b-1
01:04:08.543 --> 01:04:13.890
in its live potency, it takes a lot of work.

65b55d2d-7402-4a9f-9ff5-eab07a5666bd-0
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:19.073
Generations of people have dedicated their life to keeping

65b55d2d-7402-4a9f-9ff5-eab07a5666bd-1
01:04:19.073 --> 01:04:23.027
it that way and it's coming to you today rather too easy in my

65b55d2d-7402-4a9f-9ff5-eab07a5666bd-2
01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:23.529
opinion.

5465453b-25e1-4514-a041-3128056af4e1-0
01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:28.150
Sitting at home in your own sitting room, bedroom, some of

5465453b-25e1-4514-a041-3128056af4e1-1
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:29.650
you have inclinations.

343359cb-3c8e-4098-8d91-899fde0c5e9f-0
01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:34.864
The girl is lying down half and it's coming to you lying down,

343359cb-3c8e-4098-8d91-899fde0c5e9f-1
01:04:34.864 --> 01:04:35.970
chichi chichi.

09175d5f-a77a-43cd-93b8-2cc0bda9b1d3-0
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:39.686
I should have made you sweep and swab and Washington for 12

09175d5f-a77a-43cd-93b8-2cc0bda9b1d3-1
01:04:39.686 --> 01:04:40.010
years.

0761adf2-40d3-41af-8d11-ca84fc466dfa-0
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.320
Then you would be, because it's coming to you easy.

ff7682d5-25f3-4ecf-86f0-8e9196d8f8e8-0
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.680
Do not underestimate it.

04878291-6158-4893-a251-39327ee940e3-0
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.665
I'm telling you, if you never came in touch with anything that

04878291-6158-4893-a251-39327ee940e3-1
01:04:51.665 --> 01:04:54.320
is transformative in your life, that's your misfortune.

42177ab3-fab2-475d-a18b-fb1f6099db99-0
01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.340
But you got the most precious thing that you can have in your

42177ab3-fab2-475d-a18b-fb1f6099db99-1
01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:05.960
life and then you put it under the table and forgot about it.

822d89cd-a867-4041-b719-9826559f3610-0
01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.250
That's a tragedy, isn't it?

69775143-1861-41b3-b711-7a6931162406-0
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:14.450
Huh.

1d4c4033-f3bd-4650-91ea-7727ad725c0a-0
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:15.290
It's like this.

9336a0ab-be36-410f-a010-3d5987961982-0
01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:19.530
There was a beggar local.

8e1fdc27-f2ac-493a-a482-f74f9db5e282-0
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:27.446
He was sitting under a tree every day as he saw people going

8e1fdc27-f2ac-493a-a482-f74f9db5e282-1
01:05:27.446 --> 01:05:31.930
up and down in various levels of affluence and well-being.

0f3ce979-31e4-40a0-943c-ec49b9dd38c7-0
01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:34.090
He looked up and cried.

01df9410-d2b4-41d1-a5bb-3d3186fefe62-0
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:34.650
Oh God.

e1b54a17-132d-4829-99e9-4ec352ce3d1d-0
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:40.840
Give me wealth.

2132617e-85f8-418b-820c-76ef202f3aee-0
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.680
Give me money.

27c3d19a-e950-4ac6-9697-ff6b9ecf668e-0
01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.440
Why have you kept me like this?

83f2afdc-8fdb-4064-b918-be74f5b3702e-0
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.120
Look at her.

2cef934e-b6f4-475a-9c78-8cf2c61fb1e1-0
01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:44.800
Look at him.

6a99f55b-0572-4598-85d2-d7350a19118d-0
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.360
Look at her.

c33b4fa7-7447-4814-aa18-fadef5e8932c-0
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:45.920
Look at him.

9a6a9322-a4c7-4f3c-ab8d-15bc0423ce42-0
01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.920
They're all doing well.

9016f61b-679c-44d3-88a9-71ff1e1dcb61-0
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.400
Why me Like this?

c608f240-af4e-425e-86dc-c8d180710821-0
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.400
Every day he cried to God.

285ce165-a37d-46e2-b509-0ddaa70d5092-0
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.600
Well, of course.

eb4f4251-4d9f-42ac-bc48-61f61b99b2e5-0
01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.520
One day he died a beggar's body.

350476e2-b27d-4e6e-a157-fde4c69ba2c7-0
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.720
Who wants to carry?

ab087345-964a-40a6-a034-254f5e8e848f-0
01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.080
You have to find 4 volunteers to carry the body.

a1a60c37-a6f6-44e8-a1e8-3d7064dcf5bb-0
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.520
No volunteers.

17063b8d-585b-4555-8923-59b356a8fa0c-0
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.160
So.

345ccd59-168d-4d0b-aea5-2c6205d58d71-0
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.600
But you can't ignore the dead.

104997e6-c899-4691-b21d-61eb320f37e8-0
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.440
You know, that's one thing.

3356f6ec-6f69-4355-9454-cfbbf9187da3-0
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.040
You can ignore him when he's alive.

caa19b64-b61b-40a6-8d9f-e5020d30f7c8-0
01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.100
Sadhguru when he is dead.

d134a233-b09e-4d0e-8a37-ac1c556150a5-0
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.900
If you ignore him, he will make a whole town stink.

81cb84db-c1cd-4285-a84b-a56206661226-0
01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:13.460
Hello.

c2d8a4ff-ac60-457b-8ec0-8429a55dbddf-0
01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.260
He won't let you live.

ffde36c0-f1a3-4a75-9445-837a61b4afd0-0
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.820
When he was alive you could ignore him.

b4dd9c12-38ce-45a3-8ee5-ed72443c275b-0
01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.700
Once he is dead, you can't ignore him.

60ff2a65-bdf9-4fc3-a8f7-3f32d8366657-0
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.500
So people will said OK, what the hell to do?

7102482e-d5c4-4582-a1d2-b90dc3a17e5d-0
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.540
This fellow is dead.

6a65cd9a-2c6f-4e60-a4c9-4a712017dc53-0
01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.177
So let's dig a hole right there beneath him and put him right

6a65cd9a-2c6f-4e60-a4c9-4a712017dc53-1
01:06:28.177 --> 01:06:30.100
there inside and bury him under the tree.

828ff07a-f059-4e11-a90a-e5ad7a8a218d-0
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.820
So they started digging.

c96ea7c6-d9c8-45c5-aae5-4ef79fd1aa78-0
01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.580
Tonk tonk sound came.

ec9882ce-783c-49d3-948d-1659704af59b-0
01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.540
Metallic sound.

e8e7cba2-c46e-44a0-a692-60b5252675b4-0
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.040
They opened TCH.

d69a7285-d7a8-4f33-9d57-8271304710c4-0
01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.120
A huge vessel full of diamonds.

bcf932f5-b745-4fc2-ad84-6cd147f8c00d-0
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.945
He was sitting on it all his life and looking up and praying

bcf932f5-b745-4fc2-ad84-6cd147f8c00d-1
01:06:46.945 --> 01:06:47.520
endlessly.

2ddfddf3-7272-46ca-aaba-eeca1f1eb233-0
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.880
This is tragedy, isn't it?

bdfd9b5a-9369-4d1b-bcc4-30002c4446e1-0
01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.880
If you don't have it, that is a misfortune.

63102ea2-3ac8-457d-8098-e33192ab6f11-0
01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.980
If you have it and you don't know how to use it, that is a

63102ea2-3ac8-457d-8098-e33192ab6f11-1
01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.760
real tragedy.

5b3420e7-05c4-4897-852e-5b7ae9801d80-0
01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.000
Disastrous.

33cd024a-3e6d-498b-8387-918426b74063-0
01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.842
So don't become a disaster like this because it's coming to you

33cd024a-3e6d-498b-8387-918426b74063-1
01:07:04.842 --> 01:07:09.058
easy in a weekend in your own bedroom, Sadhguru, where you can

33cd024a-3e6d-498b-8387-918426b74063-2
01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.330
lie down and do OK.

f5f60b0d-394c-47da-a722-4e126fcfafab-0
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:11.610
Sadhguru, what are you saying?

739a25ec-6828-4bfc-99ff-4527dfeaff8d-0
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:19.090
I am not against comfort TCH.

5d008f17-3493-41a6-a3c0-0c82e612a85a-0
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:23.330
But comfort should enhance your life, not destroy your life.

f2a3c182-ae62-44d4-bafc-f446561a33b9-0
01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:23.690
Hello.

f64631df-aea9-4da7-9444-2f18831302b3-0
01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:25.730
Yes or no?

33bf6ab6-13d5-4836-ab69-f318e46922f1-0
01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:29.382
The idea of arranging comfortable situations for

33bf6ab6-13d5-4836-ab69-f318e46922f1-1
01:07:29.382 --> 01:07:32.806
ourselves is so that we don't have to struggle with daily

33bf6ab6-13d5-4836-ab69-f318e46922f1-2
01:07:32.806 --> 01:07:33.810
survival process.

4975942d-6f5f-4446-b339-e3f429a11ef0-0
01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.648
Our life gets enhanced because there is enough comfort around

4975942d-6f5f-4446-b339-e3f429a11ef0-1
01:07:37.648 --> 01:07:37.800
us.

e405c9db-e85c-479e-8761-653a12845a97-0
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.840
We can do what we really want to do.

17f6b7ec-6883-4f8c-b615-6840c2caf9a9-0
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.440
That's the idea of comfort.

0f5431f7-ee35-4c88-adff-004e43cd7fb3-0
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.760
But people get buried in their cushions only.

75ecfe8a-4956-45a0-a9fc-2ce5aa3ddbbb-0
01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:46.440
Hello.

898b6ed0-efe8-436f-8abe-90da205eafa4-0
01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.560
Yes, lot of people are buried in their cushions.

c86f8dfb-8095-4333-91a3-ef83d8a32136-0
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.480
Their comfort is killing them because of their comfort.

e3be7b49-b205-4edb-ac08-b2ebec693312-0
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.255
Now they've made themselves in such a way, if you ask them to

e3be7b49-b205-4edb-ac08-b2ebec693312-1
01:07:55.255 --> 01:07:57.000
stand up, they'll use all the four limbs.

01dac665-c2b0-4efb-ae9c-983e92ccf9a3-0
01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:03.367
Yes, half the population is becoming like this because

01dac665-c2b0-4efb-ae9c-983e92ccf9a3-1
01:08:03.367 --> 01:08:04.930
people do not understand.

f6dabb36-fff6-469a-b5e1-443b6a9c95b9-0
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:09.370
Comfort is a support system for us so that we can perform at a

f6dabb36-fff6-469a-b5e1-443b6a9c95b9-1
01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:13.530
higher level than what we would otherwise without comfort.

68208c75-e0f6-43c4-93ad-44c90a6c4ec8-0
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:14.250
Isn't it so?

950e6dc6-5ca8-4719-b596-8e55efaf8e5b-0
01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:17.170
But comfort is killing people.

b30cbe8e-0297-40e5-83a0-cbde784510af-0
01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:22.097
Comfort is taking away life for a whole lot of people around the

b30cbe8e-0297-40e5-83a0-cbde784510af-1
01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:22.490
world.

e2ba4f1e-c4b2-4d65-a41c-47616ea3ca5d-0
01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:26.578
Don't do that to yourself because a certain empowerment

e2ba4f1e-c4b2-4d65-a41c-47616ea3ca5d-1
01:08:26.578 --> 01:08:27.530
when it comes.

a72e2210-5805-4e8c-96d3-dd0fdc51238a-0
01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:29.130
You need to understand this.

07d94b25-2078-4023-b567-2af8795d153f-0
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:32.810
Oh, what is big deal about this arm?

a0001c1c-4501-4471-b942-2e396b5b338d-0
01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:34.370
Like this arm.

791f3369-bde4-4800-b12c-570553b83ac6-0
01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:38.250
My life will change.

c4d770f5-4281-4d4a-a431-6be3ecc49d7f-0
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:38.970
Nonsense.

f414e7eb-75b1-4fbe-952b-e05456e905ac-0
01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:42.290
That's how it is.

c88863ef-3d02-4d7f-bb36-bba00e938260-0
01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:46.010
That's how it is.

38a2837c-6446-487c-a2e6-1806b2b624a6-0
01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:49.890
Just to fulfill some desire, two people did something.

6b46cada-b417-42ba-819a-9949b20bf489-0
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.570
Look at us.

105b7d7c-2597-4d3e-a5b2-cd150f33a303-0
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:51.450
All of us here.

7effb332-ad45-4865-a4e5-ac742ea32ee8-0
01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:53.090
Hello.

1b14a7a6-fa3e-40d1-94d7-c5f02415f5cb-0
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:54.250
Yes or no?

7f3b06bf-bd34-4935-b7b5-5e387dc371b2-0
01:08:56.530 --> 01:08:57.450
We're here or not.

4e70173f-409d-45bb-84a7-253938ab6eea-0
01:08:58.210 --> 01:09:00.290
Yes, real.

68032482-d840-439a-af96-45f1a9beeda8-0
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:02.250
Are you real online people?

82595b76-7e08-4572-8e8c-8d363a8f1fcb-0
01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:03.330
I'm asking you, are you real?

005f8fd5-6418-4859-8885-6350546e792f-0
01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:15.714
They'll take 25 seconds to respond and how you receive it

005f8fd5-6418-4859-8885-6350546e792f-1
01:09:15.714 --> 01:09:18.490
is very important.

58182832-870a-4779-ae66-b0d15f07fd53-0
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:22.638
That is why these 30 hours of structure for 21 minute

58182832-870a-4779-ae66-b0d15f07fd53-1
01:09:22.638 --> 01:09:23.330
practice.

7d9a3241-ce93-4bae-8abb-a0b890a5475b-0
01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:31.196
It once happened Shankaran Pillai got spiritual thirst just

7d9a3241-ce93-4bae-8abb-a0b890a5475b-1
01:09:31.196 --> 01:09:32.220
like you.

ad84defd-0054-4e7f-bbbe-26ed940e05ef-0
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.820
So he went looking for a a guru.

0c34e491-76a9-466c-b8af-4a2298712811-0
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:47.340
After much search he found one and he found a mouni guru.

3a81e1b3-b171-4655-ba87-16d43ebd6571-0
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.140
That means a silent man, a silent guru.

8ca74354-a956-499b-a486-00f8fec6ca9e-0
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.460
He doesn't speak a silent master.

1d986770-129a-45a8-8054-2332714ee0bc-0
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:54.860
TCH.

c91b5c16-c817-45c2-b707-f5030e4ba0d9-0
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.598
He went and sat there day after day, week after week, week,

c91b5c16-c817-45c2-b707-f5030e4ba0d9-1
01:09:59.598 --> 01:10:01.020
month after month.

0581d6d9-4f96-4908-aa30-9b9b9db93ceb-0
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.780
Said nothing.

da0a632b-237a-4200-af79-9a7dec263f2c-0
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.860
Forget about week after week, month after month.

99be8e46-a77c-44d7-81ff-2301b42b7be3-0
01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:15.140
This weekend you sat there in front of your screen.

19c40fd5-ccbf-4fa4-8a8e-f221f540ae06-0
01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.820
I said nothing.

97b86111-ca5d-49d8-843c-42e2d362fc17-0
01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.500
You know I'm very good at this.

7c65d517-7546-481f-a125-ed9081dc448b-0
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.419
You have only seen me talking because the cameras are on only

7c65d517-7546-481f-a125-ed9081dc448b-1
01:10:25.419 --> 01:10:26.220
when I'm talking.

14b29afb-5dfa-4146-88a9-385465a0ca02-0
01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.739
Otherwise I'm very good at not saying a damn thing for days on

14b29afb-5dfa-4146-88a9-385465a0ca02-1
01:10:29.739 --> 01:10:29.940
end.

2f33fe18-81a3-4d9a-a90b-5f282fef03db-0
01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.860
So I said nothing.

b5596b67-561a-44ba-94a6-4d5643f3563b-0
01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.780
Oh, by now you'll be crazy.

0f9f0079-6888-41cc-8ce7-b317ced011f9-0
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.086
You would have broken your device or you would be hanging

0f9f0079-6888-41cc-8ce7-b317ced011f9-1
01:10:39.086 --> 01:10:40.740
upside down from the ceiling.

bafe7afb-76ff-4666-8721-8320f70f2ee9-0
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.060
Something else.

45c8ff24-b791-4b31-8a97-81ed4fc66b42-0
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.580
Because I'm making so much noise.

fbd6a0e6-c845-45d7-a0d4-3e4557aa33a0-0
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.900
You are quick sitting quietly.

e65ea20e-107c-4326-bfac-03b482d4d97d-0
01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:52.980
But Sankaran Pillai found a maouni guru.

65280d3f-0aab-4c42-83e1-96abb37b45db-0
01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:54.820
Doesn't say a word.

61feb351-861f-473e-9988-9e2386b7a698-0
01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:56.290
Sadhguru.

d5839db2-a270-456d-a65a-c974aed75f63-0
01:10:56.290 --> 01:11:00.770
After a few months of waiting, he went crazy.

a28a074b-45c6-4425-b31e-4cb05a58be7f-0
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.370
Oh my master, enough of this silence.

34698f94-a449-4f0e-95f2-d22db53b6771-0
01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:04.090
It's killing me.

2d4cccf8-d138-49cb-b33e-5bcc60c11cf5-0
01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:04.890
Say something.

dd80d205-9b52-43fb-addf-cc1b8c05f57d-0
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:14.930
Please say something.

1ded308d-eabe-46cf-9d52-dac485a6be3a-0
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.850
Begged.

15494dfc-c769-477b-a719-23d8a1a364b8-0
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:19.410
Please.

54834c72-ca82-41eb-abe0-95f727a911df-0
01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:20.810
Pulling my feet.

bf2b9788-e567-4f2d-8676-5cef255e9235-0
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:22.290
Say something.

9b3a480e-1105-4702-b8bf-cd835bc40145-0
01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:31.338
If you are not willing to give me a whole teaching, at least

9b3a480e-1105-4702-b8bf-cd835bc40145-1
01:11:31.338 --> 01:11:33.050
just give me one simple advice.

27e6d8fd-4be7-4f2e-b7f9-9a25261ad3d2-0
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.170
I will live by it.

a094c909-2ca3-4557-85a1-66c5f8721e56-0
01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:39.970
Please this is breaking my head, your silence.

c7b9b35b-6890-4e4f-8bac-9c0606ae2c4c-0
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:47.602
Out of his compassion, the maouni guru opened his mouth and

c7b9b35b-6890-4e4f-8bac-9c0606ae2c4c-1
01:11:47.602 --> 01:11:49.850
said Neki kar kuve medao.

5887883e-5570-4eac-9fbf-e94ef020dd0d-0
01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:55.130
That means do good and throw it in the well.

edcc9873-db16-40fd-a097-a79e94e1c672-0
01:11:56.270 --> 01:12:00.834
What this means is whenever you think you have done something

edcc9873-db16-40fd-a097-a79e94e1c672-1
01:12:00.834 --> 01:12:03.190
good, never keep accounts of it.

79eae935-7656-482a-aabf-396dab64a24b-0
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:06.230
Throw it in the well where you can't see it.

6f483206-033b-423e-a3b4-475a51b107bc-0
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:12.155
Because if you think I've done something very good for this

6f483206-033b-423e-a3b4-475a51b107bc-1
01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:16.796
person, your expectations of how he should be will become so

6f483206-033b-423e-a3b4-475a51b107bc-2
01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:17.710
unrealistic.

fd1d2c7c-2a7b-4bb3-9b3a-3a716adc48e5-0
01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:19.310
It is bound to end in a disaster.

4209c2f7-e2a3-40fe-a1c9-a98ce59a2d76-0
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:21.390
TCH, this is happening.

a85adbd6-ead2-40bd-98ef-69fef1d40564-0
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.117
You know, within the family, with your own children, with

a85adbd6-ead2-40bd-98ef-69fef1d40564-1
01:12:24.117 --> 01:12:26.280
your husband, with your wife happening again.

504d5e8c-7c89-48ba-bcd1-e301fd6ae658-0
01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.208
See, for most people, they wouldn't know how to live by

504d5e8c-7c89-48ba-bcd1-e301fd6ae658-1
01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:34.640
themselves joyfully if they did not have children.

82d14d37-5e4d-4536-80c9-b2c3714edbad-0
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.985
Unfortunately, suddenly this bundle of joy arrived, not

82d14d37-5e4d-4536-80c9-b2c3714edbad-1
01:12:37.985 --> 01:12:39.120
knowing what to do.

37f086da-57fc-4598-a3c7-20f47016be80-0
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.352
People who are like concrete blocks, walking like this,

37f086da-57fc-4598-a3c7-20f47016be80-1
01:12:42.352 --> 01:12:45.642
suddenly they laughed, they crawled under the sofa, they

37f086da-57fc-4598-a3c7-20f47016be80-2
01:12:45.642 --> 01:12:48.240
danced, they sang some lousy song, whatever.

037a8fd1-784f-4045-aedd-441f79d46d37-0
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.970
All this they could do because this child came and child grew

037a8fd1-784f-4045-aedd-441f79d46d37-1
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:55.020
up and now he's no more a child.

d03b8dc8-cb21-4ef8-84c6-27cfdd22647d-0
01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.180
He wants to do his own thing.

7cdd59c9-778c-40eb-9c04-5843a82c7cb0-0
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:04.975
How much I have done for you and you won't listen to me Because

7cdd59c9-778c-40eb-9c04-5843a82c7cb0-1
01:13:04.975 --> 01:13:09.322
the moment you keep accounts, your expectations become so

7cdd59c9-778c-40eb-9c04-5843a82c7cb0-2
01:13:09.322 --> 01:13:12.020
unrealistic, nobody can fulfill it.

b0e23d85-514f-4e09-a39b-334dedc3b2a2-0
01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.300
It will end in a disaster.

264c01a4-596f-445a-8cf5-38ad413c0111-0
01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.620
So Nekikar Kuve medal.

95b1eb1c-5071-43fe-b6ba-f2d5cf9e2180-0
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.100
So Sankaran Pillai felt elated.

4f475f31-ebc4-43bf-aa1d-867b5290f112-0
01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:25.690
He got at least one teaching, so he went down looking for an

4f475f31-ebc4-43bf-aa1d-867b5290f112-1
01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:28.650
opportunity to do something good.

7d4cbcac-801f-4b62-9561-e07c13355dbf-0
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:35.484
As he was walking on the street, he saw an old lady blind of

7d4cbcac-801f-4b62-9561-e07c13355dbf-1
01:13:35.484 --> 01:13:38.490
vision, wanting to cross the street.

7b4fc552-232d-49eb-b0a4-e4350a978b53-0
01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:39.850
Classic opportunity.

fb7d974f-a1d3-43fe-9af8-b88d6b669866-0
01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:43.250
Hello, old blind wants to cross the street.

adb3c215-d2f3-4228-8724-515497998a05-0
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:44.210
Perfect.

cb021718-8d7c-4be5-bf0b-9b57ab9cace6-0
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:49.039
So he ran to her, held her by the arm, slowly, gently helped

cb021718-8d7c-4be5-bf0b-9b57ab9cace6-1
01:13:49.039 --> 01:13:52.440
her across the street and pushed her into the well.

4022fda0-f1f1-4162-af88-a890fc718c4b-0
01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.520
So it's extremely important how you receive it.

c3b81c8b-92d1-4c7b-8763-e2159e7af9a7-0
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.480
OK?

d32cc0a9-9159-4b29-9507-baa599c828d9-0
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.840
That's what we've been trying to fix.

8037a4e5-3d05-4034-ac36-112cf592f611-0
01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.160
You must continue to fix it every day.

96eff42b-b2df-4401-9acd-e6496d021c18-0
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.253
Before you do Shambhavi, you must give yourself a crash

96eff42b-b2df-4401-9acd-e6496d021c18-1
01:14:11.253 --> 01:14:12.800
course in inner engineering.

e89ebc78-3b14-47fd-a7ba-2dd7fbccf417-0
01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.600
Simple things.

6e0b9f06-d51c-4e7d-99ce-a9da6ac60a88-0
01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:17.530
The rules of the game.

0299bb27-4866-4968-84be-3113ae94d98c-0
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:22.243
Whatever game I'm playing right now in my life, whether it's

0299bb27-4866-4968-84be-3113ae94d98c-1
01:14:22.243 --> 01:14:24.330
family or business or work.

636582d0-b65e-4110-8898-afbefb5b01f8-0
01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:27.945
Oregon driving on the street or whatever nonsense I've chosen to

636582d0-b65e-4110-8898-afbefb5b01f8-1
01:14:27.945 --> 01:14:28.690
do in my life.

6d4e56b8-179a-4962-a246-5d62c95f0fbe-0
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.490
The rules of the game.

b0b8ec99-19dc-4099-a61b-54a804320775-0
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:35.645
Some rules I like, some I don't like, but the rules of the game

b0b8ec99-19dc-4099-a61b-54a804320775-1
01:14:35.645 --> 01:14:36.490
are my rules.

be2fd4af-3696-48f0-a83b-dd39286697f9-0
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:40.486
Now if I want to change the rules, there is a process for

be2fd4af-3696-48f0-a83b-dd39286697f9-1
01:14:40.486 --> 01:14:40.810
that.

a120d9f5-f36c-46af-8356-a55691c03f33-0
01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:41.530
Hello.

e9340053-f15c-4ea2-a835-725472d2d9a1-0
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:44.797
Suppose we don't want to drive on the left side of the street,

e9340053-f15c-4ea2-a835-725472d2d9a1-1
01:14:44.797 --> 01:14:45.230
sadhguru.

28c7e5d1-bea5-4bb3-862d-50c1e1fb6e03-0
01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.350
We want to drive on the right side.

8037a532-ee85-4289-90a0-b514306a3799-0
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:49.150
There's a whole process to change that rule, isn't it?

94bca1e0-9d7f-4c15-808f-fc8b0daadca7-0
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:53.002
You can't suddenly drive on the right side of the street because

94bca1e0-9d7f-4c15-808f-fc8b0daadca7-1
01:14:53.002 --> 01:14:55.709
you feel like it looks like most people feel like it in the

94bca1e0-9d7f-4c15-808f-fc8b0daadca7-2
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:56.070
country.

6e2476b1-67ce-466f-8f90-d77a5ec595c2-0
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:58.750
A whole lot of people at least.

ee97232e-4b93-49a5-9a9d-dbd998d65aed-0
01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:05.319
So first rule is this inner engineering crash course means

ee97232e-4b93-49a5-9a9d-dbd998d65aed-1
01:15:05.319 --> 01:15:09.030
remind yourself 20 seconds all the rules of the game today.

bf7b45c2-8917-42cf-adfd-25c4df0bbd43-0
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:12.605
Whatever rules I Whatever games I play today, very various kinds

bf7b45c2-8917-42cf-adfd-25c4df0bbd43-1
01:15:12.605 --> 01:15:13.430
of play fields.

7513ff31-23af-4161-bcda-dfb7da91604f-0
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.870
I have.

e0c4b693-5f46-4791-909c-47b0b89a3fe1-0
01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.580
I have family, I have office.

f0208321-2afd-40a6-a54b-0b41118b019e-0
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.260
I have business.

0c51f450-795d-4949-bfca-59b522a4542b-0
01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:16.900
I have street.

d002e41b-d3fd-4deb-b343-a26dc5dc1e99-0
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:17.780
I have social life.

5f04b9a0-9ce4-42e5-b744-40f3fbe19b59-0
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.700
All these rules that are there.

fbdccd26-bca1-4918-b3ad-fa8eec2dfc0a-0
01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:20.900
These are my rules.

72b7516e-c66e-450d-b216-2a0df1de51ed-0
01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.020
Then another 20 seconds.

e111fc1c-9f45-487a-a35d-343553fd75f9-0
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.060
My ability to respond is limitless.

82aa8df5-2c41-4108-8ac9-9258d57ada1f-0
01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.500
Another 20 seconds.

325417d7-eb3d-407b-884c-827964a55f15-0
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.700
This moment, the way it is, is the way it is.

24a4520e-8c61-4c29-84d5-ce5a00846d6a-0
01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:36.140
It cannot be any other way than the way it is.

0e78db6f-8f87-4a7f-9e12-587283ca11d4-0
01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.460
What is right now is inevitable.

a3ff7743-5a7f-4249-a28b-0779e9e4e9df-0
01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:50.174
Next moment I must create, and I am a mother to the world in an

a3ff7743-5a7f-4249-a28b-0779e9e4e9df-1
01:15:50.174 --> 01:15:54.250
engineering crash course.

88807c90-b7b9-4512-bcbc-45b463f01ca2-0
01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:55.930
Every day.

c6494315-5312-414d-b88a-9ed7cbacf36d-0
01:15:56.250 --> 01:16:02.017
Just one minute you do this and then start the practice, because

c6494315-5312-414d-b88a-9ed7cbacf36d-1
01:16:02.017 --> 01:16:06.010
the practice will energetically blow you up.

2e38a008-c599-4044-9384-5ba501e45823-0
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:11.980
But your mind, your emotion, must be conducive for that

2e38a008-c599-4044-9384-5ba501e45823-1
01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:12.760
Sadhguru.

7cfa4a2e-f386-41ad-92ba-0479accb87d1-0
01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.040
Otherwise you will unnecessarily put yourself to various things.

35567178-cbba-4789-9bfc-ee140af07476-0
01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.600
It's like, see, you want to go to Coimbatore.

5cd14789-7245-4c4c-961c-b303f14d2fe0-0
01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.720
The buses are parked right here in Isha Yoga Center.

c064230b-b4e3-4949-b0ac-d0c3da1b221c-0
01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.800
You got into the bus, but you look back at Isha Yoga Center.

04ba231a-e86f-4233-a7a2-1d88823cec76-0
01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.920

And you held the stone pillars.

4dfe9803-2122-4fe7-bbf6-555ccccd9d71-0
01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.480

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.220
Bus starts now.

a368a9bc-eedc-46ef-90ce-cd4d0e63793e-0
01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.393
Is the stone pillar going to come with you or your arm is

a368a9bc-eedc-46ef-90ce-cd4d0e63793e-1
01:16:43.393 --> 01:16:46.676
going to stay here or you are going to be pulled out of the

a368a9bc-eedc-46ef-90ce-cd4d0e63793e-2
01:16:46.676 --> 01:16:47.060
window?

9e71a4b8-2b67-4343-84cd-60276e51e55c-0
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.629
We don't know what the hell will happen, but one of these things

9e71a4b8-2b67-4343-84cd-60276e51e55c-1
01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:50.060
will happen.

ce113209-eaa8-4b82-97e0-7b086a719aca-0
01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:53.100
All of them will be damaging, yes or no.

8010ef4f-3d53-44c9-a524-35108dc0982c-0
01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:58.093
Once you decide to go to Coimbatore, you put everything

8010ef4f-3d53-44c9-a524-35108dc0982c-1
01:16:58.093 --> 01:16:59.020
into the bus.

f7a434c7-04b2-4cd5-92f8-5d5b433892a4-0
01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:02.348
One part in the bus, one part outside is going to Causeway

f7a434c7-04b2-4cd5-92f8-5d5b433892a4-1
01:17:02.348 --> 01:17:03.540
damage to you, isn't it?

44a4239e-3128-4a02-a715-967c2bd12f74-0
01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.681
Once you do a process like Shambhavi which is looking

44a4239e-3128-4a02-a715-967c2bd12f74-1
01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:14.021
towards how to push your energies beyond your physical

44a4239e-3128-4a02-a715-967c2bd12f74-2
01:17:14.021 --> 01:17:18.914
limitations, you must facilitate the same in your mind and in

44a4239e-3128-4a02-a715-967c2bd12f74-3
01:17:18.914 --> 01:17:19.940
your emotion.

f8177a94-97d9-40dc-a2db-7b4bb28ebf06-0
01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:23.220
Otherwise unnecessarily you'll be tearing yourself.

478c102b-4af1-4023-9770-e00dc34fadd7-0
01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.300
And you think spiritual process is causing me struggle?

849e934f-00dd-4c77-af34-6e94d2d1a82f-0
01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:29.460
No, it is not spiritual process.

fe0b59b8-d820-48ec-9504-65505dca7f03-0
01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.740
It's called stupidity.

01db4d59-21b8-412f-95de-f5c978e92a16-0
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.980
It's not called spiritual.

beecff55-6d7d-4fae-8c7f-ddbc90c4fd35-0
01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:35.700
Hello lot of people think stupidity is spiritual.

74af3527-105d-4267-83d5-a916f5106d03-0
01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:40.476
No, it is not if the smartest way to live in the world is that

74af3527-105d-4267-83d5-a916f5106d03-1
01:17:40.476 --> 01:17:42.250
you have become spiritual.

d9e277c4-966a-45f0-8789-cec98c6721d7-0
01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:45.420
Because that means you're addressing, addressing the

d9e277c4-966a-45f0-8789-cec98c6721d7-1
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.650
entirety of who you are, not just one part at a time.

412a9009-d351-409e-8aad-00082aaf5a91-0
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:53.741
If this one wants to go somewhere, all of it should go,

412a9009-d351-409e-8aad-00082aaf5a91-1
01:17:53.741 --> 01:17:54.290
isn't it?

c25b6d87-1f65-4549-ad3d-0b712cdd3519-0
01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:56.050
I want to go.

eb1b0ce7-bc19-4a24-93a6-8bf8a87a962f-0
01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:58.290
Just my little finger is stuck in the door.

0bfb5287-7e16-466f-a85c-95b42d1c80d7-0
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:59.250
Can I go?

5a84cd83-bb0c-4cca-b9c4-edcfee456cbb-0
01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:01.250
Just a little finger?

03bbe98b-f065-429d-ace6-9f2d3f27d272-0
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.290
Can I go, Oh, I'm a big man.

1fe37126-343c-4442-a5ab-62080baade0a-0
01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:05.610
I can leave the little finger and go.

6f9e9bb8-6625-4f44-a41c-615a37bd0129-0
01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:06.650
Is that how it works?

9e9e85bd-98bf-405c-9ed9-b672523abd0e-0
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:08.630
That's not how it works.

6bbd8171-fb5c-49aa-a4f8-623a40f50b92-0
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:10.150
All of it should go.

2ff70647-daf5-4970-bfe8-85e9c255de68-0
01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:11.750
This is what spiritual means.

d384e2c4-49df-4b49-a901-de0ca71dbf5a-0
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:13.590
This doesn't mean you leave the body.

e5ab6347-d810-48b9-8b3a-380c34a65e08-0
01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:16.910
Material means we want just the body.

7b4c7f01-ddb0-4e61-b664-e9c5834e109f-0
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:19.270
We are ignoring the other dimensions of who we are.

2d038381-9585-436c-acb2-f0e6b49fa522-0
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:22.830
Spiritual means you're taking all of it into consideration.

c3099edb-f391-4028-91b1-02a4479db3e6-0
01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:26.599
So it's important that you always, every day, give yourself

c3099edb-f391-4028-91b1-02a4479db3e6-1
01:18:26.599 --> 01:18:28.190
one minute of crash, course.

9fb9d8e9-af60-4a03-9287-2c5a31f73ddd-0
01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:28.430
Hmm.

2ef3b8a9-3d41-4214-b0a7-11e29accb19c-0
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:31.950
And then do the practice.

f5de4401-8370-4356-ad63-0bf7f42c8bac-0
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:36.198
Because making the mind and Emotion Conducive, the energetic

f5de4401-8370-4356-ad63-0bf7f42c8bac-1
01:18:36.198 --> 01:18:40.378
aspiration of who you are, is important, that everything is

f5de4401-8370-4356-ad63-0bf7f42c8bac-2
01:18:40.378 --> 01:18:42.049
moving in One Direction.

52d77579-3fb1-4bba-b099-b952c006771e-0
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:45.576
Different things moving in different directions is always a

52d77579-3fb1-4bba-b099-b952c006771e-1
01:18:45.576 --> 01:18:47.330
problem in every aspect of life.

78863cb3-9e2c-455f-8dee-0ce7e08b1e23-0
01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:53.130
I think we should go into the Are you somewhat hungry?

5ee4d6c5-4d74-432a-a236-1f93a3090d3f-0
01:18:53.610 --> 01:19:00.330
See, we'll just demonstrate A compressed version of Shambhavi.

0404a0d6-6f76-46e8-b9fc-c59e48b48497-0
01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:01.930
Once again, please observe.

d3709e3a-4643-4354-bc5f-5cf0a2084944-0
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:03.890
Don't do anything when she's doing it.

2c9e627e-6085-4671-8a1f-79f3b985aec8-0
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:05.600
Just observe here.

9265ef2b-96b1-40c5-b368-db9b181ba81a-0
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.800
This lady is sitting down and writing down everything.

0b90599e-a238-4c45-8a4e-d039ddbcf604-0
01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.680
That's not the way.

8f88449b-b078-40d0-8d48-bc12c6b76747-0
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.735
If that's all I wanted to do, I would have sent you a printed

8f88449b-b078-40d0-8d48-bc12c6b76747-1
01:19:11.735 --> 01:19:12.000
sheet.

ef7a9e3e-4e1e-4838-8a3b-2f30e82dccc9-0
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.160
Please look up Ma here.

44fb1f68-f818-466a-bd82-a6a8b147b66c-0
01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:24.520
She's demonstrating demo 25
seconds.

062faf0f-d734-499d-8490-988e4c748992-0
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.720
The lady in the pink dress.

408e0c4f-9ee4-46f3-b3a1-ec98e206acb8-0
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.047
Please look up and see from the book that you're writing upon,

408e0c4f-9ee4-46f3-b3a1-ec98e206acb8-1
01:19:34.047 --> 01:19:35.370
because I would have.

afe7ae33-dcfd-475d-8f29-53a07b2cfe30-0
01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:39.066
If any book has to be written about initiation and Chambavi

afe7ae33-dcfd-475d-8f29-53a07b2cfe30-1
01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:40.730
Mahamudra, let me write it.

82c0b2dd-148e-401a-92be-89526dc1be3a-0
01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:41.170
Not you.

2c52fd40-3216-4b1e-a2ab-f778ea0a4b20-0
01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:42.090
Please.

fea05440-0995-4365-81dc-d59a2f08a08e-0
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:46.810
Please learn to do it right.

52e5d544-6124-4c25-8122-ee39f8c1834a-0
01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:47.170
OK.

f55dbf94-c502-429c-8751-f6e96ec92313-0
01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:52.490
Sukhakriya.

d1134e8d-6336-4cf8-bb8f-5850d83af5ac-0
01:20:23.180 --> 01:22:10.400
I'm chanting None Rendus so you understand what's being done.

4e2114bf-7d07-4419-b57c-91f9904bb220-0
01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.719
First is Sukhakriya 6 to 7
minutes and then you do arm

4e2114bf-7d07-4419-b57c-91f9904bb220-1
01:22:14.719 --> 01:22:19.667
chanting 21 times and then you keep your face slightly upturn,

4e2114bf-7d07-4419-b57c-91f9904bb220-2
01:22:19.667 --> 01:22:24.379
keeping the focus between your eyebrows and get your breath

4e2114bf-7d07-4419-b57c-91f9904bb220-3
01:22:24.379 --> 01:22:27.600
into your flutter as rapidly as you can.

c83805f9-78a2-4706-8d7e-834fc9e24488-0
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.000
The ideal way of doing it is 240
times per minute.

a168917b-9071-4fd6-a540-659d5f004dee-0
01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.880
That means four times a second.

ca204344-a57e-49cb-9b05-bd31e7fc8617-0
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.645
It must be both in and out, so it can only be on the surface,

ca204344-a57e-49cb-9b05-bd31e7fc8617-1
01:22:36.645 --> 01:22:37.440
like a flutter.

6c56794b-e68e-46cc-bdc5-1c1016ea00d0-0
01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.080
Don't breathe hard.

362374c6-56f6-4e1d-a1e3-4b83e6f7fbbb-0
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.447
That will Causeway what is called as hyperventilation,

362374c6-56f6-4e1d-a1e3-4b83e6f7fbbb-1
01:22:42.447 --> 01:22:44.040
which is not good for you.

0949ee34-f3f4-4de2-bf62-dbc913e64ca9-0
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.000
So you do this for three to four minutes.

69cf6c88-f60c-4daa-82fd-b5432f15b364-0
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.530
When I say bhandas you inhale fully, take your head back, tuck

69cf6c88-f60c-4daa-82fd-b5432f15b364-1
01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:53.120
your chin in, bring it down, pull the diaphragm.

fd5a599a-d3d7-4a76-9cde-eca6f28d06d2-0
01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.720
Hold the analog.

93d7f844-c182-45a5-9bf2-6cd4831b39fa-0
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.640
Sit there with the fullness of breath.

dbca0aea-1997-438f-b09b-ff52bed62e46-0
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.340
When you feel like exhalation, bring your head up.

75a7696e-2b03-4478-b085-af43814951b6-0
01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:05.485
Only the other two locks remain as they are exhaled through your

75a7696e-2b03-4478-b085-af43814951b6-1
01:23:05.485 --> 01:23:06.060
nostrils.

9e3a15b2-dc1e-4be7-af20-1c547dda843e-0
01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.756
After the exhalation is complete, take your head back,

9e3a15b2-dc1e-4be7-af20-1c547dda843e-1
01:23:08.756 --> 01:23:10.300
tuck your chin in, bring it down.

5e7496ac-12ff-483e-a93e-88e7f55efa8f-0
01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.664
This means you've engaged the three locks once again on

5e7496ac-12ff-483e-a93e-88e7f55efa8f-1
01:23:13.664 --> 01:23:14.780
emptiness of breath.

f1e604f7-e333-4c20-96f7-9df15001dda7-0
01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:19.594
And when you feel like inhalation, bring your head up

f1e604f7-e333-4c20-96f7-9df15001dda7-1
01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:20.420
and inhale.

b781c9d9-6248-4e25-8422-37bf9d40e9ec-0
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:23.860
Through this whole process, your focus is between the eyebrows.

30b470b3-45c6-4fd0-9264-5bb7298b03fd-0
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.420
You bring your head up and exhale.

be6e3038-762d-457b-8356-a9851421401c-0
01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:30.105
Inhale through the nostrils and after the inhalation is

be6e3038-762d-457b-8356-a9851421401c-1
01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:33.593
complete, only after the inhalation is complete, you

be6e3038-762d-457b-8356-a9851421401c-2
01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:34.910
relax the diaphragm.

41cc914c-4b52-421b-8c41-a8ea20293527-0
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.910
Then you relax the interlock.

e2076207-3d35-4616-8c01-f96dfa270508-0
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:40.350
Sit there with a slightly upturned face between you.

e89fae53-3519-460b-9ff2-40cfb62d7028-0
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:41.870
Focus between your eyebrows.

afc8d431-30db-4bb8-bacb-d25c4272f010-0

01:52:38.130 --> 01:52:41.290
Not enough, but what I can.

6da93604-1d85-4afc-8c5b-ab8b6777367e-0
01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:01.360
Layer and layer.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.200
You feel off me.

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:10.960
The pain it is, but the joy it brings.

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:19.338
So thank you for showing me what I'm like, for showing me what I

35c2ac97-4d9e-4c5a-af28-99b048da9842-1
01:53:19.338 --> 01:53:20.360
could be.

3fd0401b-8706-40fa-b4fd-ddaba36686ec-0
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:49.160
But if I could all live just be you could show me all the things

3fd0401b-8706-40fa-b4fd-ddaba36686ec-1
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.790

You are the only thing that is taken away.

aff5d033-88a0-4208-b300-61ebba9e0e37-0
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:18.870
The pain I've known.

01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:22.470
The pain I've known.

1d611263-3b4c-4d6e-b07d-b4f22e3555fb-0
01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:25.130
Holeless.

40462720-667c-4713-a89c-f8113f064474-0
01:54:25.170 --> 01:54:30.050
I was hopeless and nothing else would do.

56a76d68-c4c8-4b3e-875c-93af83c3b4f3-0
01:54:30.970 --> 01:54:33.890
You saved me.

So thank you for making it rain inside.

5efcbca3-66b2-4e16-b9a9-7b95075bf7de-0
01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.130
Shedding those tears I'd hide.

01:54:53.770 --> 01:55:01.772
Thank you for showing me love within what would have taken me

e14a9ea1-3f9c-41a4-9c1e-c7ffee5c802e-1
01:55:01.772 --> 01:55:06.290
years lives, if not years to save.

01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:08.370
But who?

9dc8c69a-8a3d-48ce-aabf-d4b66613947b-0
01:55:10.210 --> 01:55:17.298
If I could only give in, you could take me on a journal

9dc8c69a-8a3d-48ce-aabf-d4b66613947b-1
01:55:17.298 --> 01:55:19.450
beginning no end.

b20ac88b-e30c-48ad-ac69-bee989bafa70-0
01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:35.560
Help me, help me surrender totally.

a86bf08e-de52-4eab-b3ce-d9b7410d833e-0

You are my special Angel.

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:34.960
You found me when I was out of places to go, of people too much

01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:37.480
to turn joyless.

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.520
I was joyless.

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:49.240
You came and you caught me over the haying claims of misery.

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:59.716

e001789a-9bab-41ab-b7b8-fc2a15cac509-1
01:56:59.716 --> 01:57:03.840
sin of not knowing who I am.

Oh, if I could only give in, there would be no peeling, only

898df192-fa2c-4e48-b370-5b15d7389b32-1
01:57:45.493 --> 01:57:48.210
shedding of my skin.
