00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.640
We'll start with invocation.

1e2e61c3-6678-4073-a08e-d0d3081f21b0-0
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.160
Please hold Brahma Mudra in your hands.

2f39c808-22bd-4eee-a0a8-642e42604c95-0
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.840
Place your right palm over the left palm, palms facing upwards.

ff1b9dc2-f37a-4254-b335-631a77cf04ec-0
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.280
Loosely place in your lap those of you and Spectacles.

5b4d9bb3-9dba-49f8-bb76-238719911856-0
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.240
Please keep them aside.

06f833ed-8763-43b5-b65f-4f63ad598744-0
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.810
Please close your eyes.

0a81f503-188f-43cf-9907-b633512910e4-0
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.210
We'll set invocation together.

cbd45f43-84ac-4ab1-b7d0-dc74b1fe56c3-0
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.680
Slowly open your eyes.

6c97ea00-229a-4913-8e5d-a77504b74b3b-0
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.600
So today we'll be going through the practices again.

71b9ee58-2f29-4d16-896d-af12f319d56f-0
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.440
We'll review them again, and we'll learn a few more steps.

3d9b3ad9-a996-4cc6-b78e-5710deaf01a0-0
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.253
But before we do that, let's hear from Sadhguru on the

3d9b3ad9-a996-4cc6-b78e-5710deaf01a0-1
00:02:09.253 --> 00:02:13.184
significance of Kriya meditations and other Yogi

3d9b3ad9-a996-4cc6-b78e-5710deaf01a0-2
00:02:13.184 --> 00:02:18.079
practices for the search of truth now scam Sadhguru sadhguru

3d9b3ad9-a996-4cc6-b78e-5710deaf01a0-3
00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.610
like I have hundreds of questions sadhguru.

5f81d358-0bb6-4404-8312-790000e071c6-0
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.370
Oh, but I would just ask one Is this one not one?

e13015d0-a5c8-4e08-bc1a-aef2f46c4c05-0
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.167
I would like to know the practices you offer like hatha

e13015d0-a5c8-4e08-bc1a-aef2f46c4c05-1
00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:37.193
yoga, Shambhavi and Shakti Zarana and the process of

e13015d0-a5c8-4e08-bc1a-aef2f46c4c05-2
00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:37.650
Samyama.

c21c6e84-5343-4762-a970-b59a15c8a7aa-0
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.058
If one follows this intensely with involvement, will all of

c21c6e84-5343-4762-a970-b59a15c8a7aa-1
00:02:42.058 --> 00:02:44.730
the will all of my questions get answered?

cc9ad224-a782-4377-8af5-1ce6b445e067-0
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.300
Yeah, no, none of your questions will be answered.

b81dff60-a855-4254-a188-011649a2736d-0
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.930
I'm only answering questions to larger public who don't do any

b81dff60-a855-4254-a188-011649a2736d-1
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.820
practice.

3a220ccb-97a3-4826-88d0-8af5a786d772-0
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.220
Those who are practicing every day intensely.

d2bca6b3-dc8a-4a19-b2e7-b67503dff879-0
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.052
Am I taking any of their questions or answering any

d2bca6b3-dc8a-4a19-b2e7-b67503dff879-1
00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:19.250
questions, sadhguru?

5feb16d9-ffde-4c63-8489-b5befc882b21-0
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.650
No, I don't.

c97de382-73c5-4140-82f4-9e56cfeb07fb-0
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.976
Because the idea of doing sadhana is all the questions

c97de382-73c5-4140-82f4-9e56cfeb07fb-1
00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:25.770
will burn.

52c8c41e-8a9b-48ce-a688-5e30d777444d-0
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.770
Not that you'll find answers.

70642a62-1cac-4f89-a48f-64d03574f392-0
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.810
If your questions are gone, What do answers mean?

8eeaec9d-cd87-469b-b770-cbfdd1ed0862-0
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.529
People who don't do anything about their internal well-being

8eeaec9d-cd87-469b-b770-cbfdd1ed0862-1
00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:49.565
but think sadhguru, by asking a question and hearing an answer,

8eeaec9d-cd87-469b-b770-cbfdd1ed0862-2
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:52.320
their life is going to be settled.

37dd51ec-be36-499d-af3f-4f4bd402a4cf-0
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.240
We are still entertaining them.

d8acb970-38dd-43e1-83fe-e77d5f39bd4e-0
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.440
OK?

cd14147e-0330-44fb-822b-dc8146aa555c-0
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.800
The entertainment will stop at some point.

566199bd-c05c-4a66-bc75-b4817dfacc24-0
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.760
Right now it's still on.

c3018545-a725-4616-ba86-de21641e7b15-0
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.280
At some point I will stop the entertainment totally.

9bfdc9b9-0ea1-4fff-8579-ccd5d5cf580d-0
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.600
Right now it's still on.

0275fcd1-c920-4831-af47-e9b9a3d53b61-0
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.800
At some point.

c2afd541-9ebe-42b3-8dcc-dc9eac12d1e0-0
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.465
It'll be only available to those who are intensely doing that

c2afd541-9ebe-42b3-8dcc-dc9eac12d1e0-1
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:17.470
sadhana Sadhguru.

50741edb-e2ec-46a7-9a27-3cc259826809-0
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:28.160
The rest they must listen to the YouTube because you know, old

50741edb-e2ec-46a7-9a27-3cc259826809-1
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:38.511
cinema is always entertaining because you need to understand

50741edb-e2ec-46a7-9a27-3cc259826809-2
00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:39.360
this.

9d73e602-588a-45a8-8c4a-607720af4c35-0
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.680
Questions are coming from a place which can never know.

609e1d3f-19f4-463a-b237-fe8acb8f2107-0
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.554
That place from which you're asking questions is not capable

609e1d3f-19f4-463a-b237-fe8acb8f2107-1
00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:54.720
of knowing anything.

c8e8b98c-1b77-4330-9cf1-63dc99efabe1-0
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.720
It wants a conclusion.

f5b35e22-5e85-41b2-9924-7ce0425f7f41-0
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.840
I am not the sort to give you a conclusion.

a8357972-1e8d-4c26-8da9-c9a739971f0a-0
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.960
I am a process.

6a914cb2-febc-4a64-ba67-8c7e0fa188b9-0
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.682
If you are willing to be a process of growth, I am there

6a914cb2-febc-4a64-ba67-8c7e0fa188b9-1
00:05:09.682 --> 00:05:10.160
for you.

dc1f0808-ad96-4702-9b6d-3d0626f95b87-0
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.360
You want a conclusion.

fddd0a3d-bf61-4c25-9753-3b4a187b5529-0
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.283
I will frustrate you because what is the point of a

fddd0a3d-bf61-4c25-9753-3b4a187b5529-1
00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:20.680
conclusion?

6c216726-dea4-4b4b-b668-273a65987ae3-0
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.733
This is an ongoing process and the process becomes so beautiful

6c216726-dea4-4b4b-b668-273a65987ae3-1
00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:34.333
and heady that you don't care where is the conclusion, then

6c216726-dea4-4b4b-b668-273a65987ae3-2
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:37.040
you don't have any questions.

3da18d5b-4bd2-4291-b40d-de1ddacba081-0
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.589
So if I do all my sadhana, you're talking about it like

3da18d5b-4bd2-4291-b40d-de1ddacba081-1
00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:51.853
it's some torturous process, that if I do all this well, all

3da18d5b-4bd2-4291-b40d-de1ddacba081-2
00:05:51.853 --> 00:05:54.950
my questions get answered.

619123ad-49ac-49f3-9f1e-009d648cbeef-0
00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:06.470
See this happened, Shankaran Pillai.

97f892fb-fcd3-4688-bd84-47d1b3807ca4-0
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.110
Hey, that's not fair.

ac2a4b6f-c99e-4cab-8c69-b201ee5bfba0-0
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.190
It's not always funny.

138c9033-de13-4079-86c3-683cfcf8d412-0
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.430
Sometimes it's serious.

2805998e-e19f-4f72-bd9e-987cc767a0ef-0
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.814
Shankaran Pillai filed for divorce in the divorce, whatever

2805998e-e19f-4f72-bd9e-987cc767a0ef-1
00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:28.200
the form they filed in the court.

3ea028bd-b0d7-4574-bc90-1e287fcc5f8c-0
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.511
He said that I want separation because of illness and

3ea028bd-b0d7-4574-bc90-1e287fcc5f8c-1
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:35.520
exhaustion.

8dbc25be-ebe3-4267-aebc-b6463abfd2c0-0
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.657
The judge looked at this and asked what is this illness and

8dbc25be-ebe3-4267-aebc-b6463abfd2c0-1
00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:41.240
exhaustion.

e4f10f11-e472-46ec-acf5-5aebb7aabfe0-0
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.480
So Shankaran Pillai said that's my lawyer's job.

3f0bccc4-be63-4b88-bce5-c5bd32cc3100-0
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:57.762
I only said I'm sick and tired of her, so questions can be

3f0bccc4-be63-4b88-bce5-c5bd32cc3100-1
00:06:57.762 --> 00:07:02.700
answered in many ways.

5f01139d-4d03-4e21-8c5a-d9d1aa80870a-0
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.763
So as a beginner, if you have questions because that is how

5f01139d-4d03-4e21-8c5a-d9d1aa80870a-1
00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:16.020
yearning begins in the form of questions, it's OK.

f4637dce-1be4-4d7c-8d7d-a13d7d7e9257-0
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.800
We are not against questions.

2f169a8d-3ce1-4a54-837d-344381aeac39-0
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.637
But I want you to know the place from which all these questions

2f169a8d-3ce1-4a54-837d-344381aeac39-1
00:07:23.637 --> 00:07:24.720
are manufactured.

284ef6f2-b549-4426-bbd5-27da56914b56-0
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.440
That place is incapable of knowing.

8fbc74a8-47e7-4746-876c-4da5905e0170-0
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.640
It's like this, you know, Do you do this?

b4a3eff7-4d09-4286-8b49-4fdedf5e62da-0
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.000
Don't do that.

8fb6283a-04d2-46d9-855c-e7e7e7937ba3-0
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.000
No, You must do it somewhere in your bathroom.

f6fe34d9-016c-4ce6-821c-314d3f6d1ea4-0
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
At least you must do that.

4484aae9-b447-4b92-bac6-045abeb4f066-0
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.350
You should not do it everywhere, sadhguru.

bfc21a6b-920c-4abc-b822-40581d459090-0
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.350
So you do this vibe to clean your nostrils.

fe181244-4871-476e-b79f-52e90b3f821d-0
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.270
So after some time if you ask can my finger breathe?

a1407256-2c50-4af6-bc73-a06ccd2a9948-0
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.470
It cannot breathe.

88cff651-3c56-4637-ac6f-7873da93f63b-0
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.211
It can clean up the breathing passages, it can clean up the

88cff651-3c56-4637-ac6f-7873da93f63b-1
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.310
passage, but it cannot breathe.

78ac63e4-39ce-49c4-af0b-54208acbca00-0
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.830
So don't ever believe your intellect will know.

6070ebd6-0ac8-4333-bf39-8feb03ae981a-0
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.110
It will not know.

075bd0c4-dfc7-4702-8440-47fccad62dfe-0
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.550
It asks questions because it's like that.

56de9fe5-ec67-4e90-a32d-bc735a6adaca-0
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.290
Right now it's OK Nothing wrong with it.

01454290-bc0e-4e4d-86d2-3edbe00c1241-0
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.020
Now how to go about these practices?

97f92c71-738e-4b34-bb9c-e778b48c739a-0
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:53.360
Let's hear from Sadhguru, Namaskaram, sadhguru, sadhguru.

192b8926-2cb1-4d73-9964-ea597616ac97-0
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.629
Like I have hundreds of questions Sadhguru Oh, but I

192b8926-2cb1-4d73-9964-ea597616ac97-1
00:08:57.629 --> 00:08:59.160
would just ask one.

20db82c4-211d-4888-b722-906eddce8c0c-0
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.120
Is this one not one?

efd30226-46d2-4b07-8ed3-7f87bf3d947f-0
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.720
I would like to know the practices you offer.

5d56a8a9-309c-4368-8b46-a0f47c8ed111-0
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.443
It must be done far more meticulously in the way it's

5d56a8a9-309c-4368-8b46-a0f47c8ed111-1
00:09:57.443 --> 00:09:58.310
being done.

6e309321-a07c-435b-8108-09ffdb44d748-0
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:05.690
This is not stretching exercise, simply you must pay absolute

6e309321-a07c-435b-8108-09ffdb44d748-1
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.310
attention to this.

cbc4ef6e-171f-44bf-a847-0c978a574883-0
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:18.834
Everything that's happening in the system because essentially

cbc4ef6e-171f-44bf-a847-0c978a574883-1
00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:27.626
physical world, how it functions, how efficiently it

cbc4ef6e-171f-44bf-a847-0c978a574883-2
00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:38.243
functions or how inefficiently it functions essentially depends

cbc4ef6e-171f-44bf-a847-0c978a574883-3
00:10:38.243 --> 00:10:43.220
upon its geometric perfection.

8f0d879c-6d38-4e78-b806-4f54930ce134-0
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:53.189
If something is geometrically well aligned then it'll function

8f0d879c-6d38-4e78-b806-4f54930ce134-1
00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:55.880
with least amount of friction.

c5c61fe6-de71-4cb3-a09b-744c2c73bf6e-0
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.745
If it functions if something or anything functions with least

c5c61fe6-de71-4cb3-a09b-744c2c73bf6e-1
00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:06.960
amount of friction, we say it's a very efficient machine.

b4fb52a6-4428-45fb-8ce8-8dd15aad6e34-0
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.080
If something is very efficient, it means it is friction free.

ada9f911-274d-4ba9-810c-e848fb2d0455-0
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:25.381
If it's friction free, only then you can do whatever you want

ada9f911-274d-4ba9-810c-e848fb2d0455-1
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.780
with it right now.

bee2ef99-23df-4179-a6d7-039738d3efb1-0
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.780
Little friction going on within you.

bfe6266b-84d6-4226-ad46-82d7e6ec1a93-0
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.297
There is nothing much you can do with it to bring this to a state

bfe6266b-84d6-4226-ad46-82d7e6ec1a93-1
00:11:35.297 --> 00:11:39.300
where it's simply friction free because it's well aligned.

ccb01793-b2fb-4b3a-a00b-6833649c1df3-0
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:45.293
Friction or alignment is not just about the body, as we

ccb01793-b2fb-4b3a-a00b-6833649c1df3-1
00:11:45.293 --> 00:11:49.500
looked at it very vaguely in the beginning.

66e5d5cc-da55-4627-bc4c-c1ef08db913b-0
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.910
We are sitting here right now, not of our own accord.

8aee4705-4275-4eac-8906-31ca3d6de0b8-0
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.961
There are too many forces supporting us to sit here like

8aee4705-4275-4eac-8906-31ca3d6de0b8-1
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:02.310
this.

541e2695-79de-448a-bae8-219aca657f79-0
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.950
Yes or no?

e6bcca4f-2541-47f4-8074-01c793f3285f-0
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.710
Hmm.

dbc2aa57-12ca-4f65-8bf7-9e1b5ce41ad9-0
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.556
There is a gravity, there is a centripetal centrifugal force,

dbc2aa57-12ca-4f65-8bf7-9e1b5ce41ad9-1
00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:16.402
and there are other dimensions of various dynamics working to

dbc2aa57-12ca-4f65-8bf7-9e1b5ce41ad9-2
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:21.170
keep this in a certain level of integrity and a certain way.

2a48c1c1-b2d8-40db-9e02-007e967a14a6-0
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.650
This doesn't happen by itself.

8969d144-1c52-433a-a0cc-60c894146a28-0
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.450
It is a cooperation of many things.

b8021e70-94a8-432c-a11d-4d9b39b2f459-0
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.090
All those things are happening efficiently.

ef0bb3f9-7d3f-4155-a219-f48e3fec6f8c-0
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.810
That is why this is happening like this.

2e60d82f-6db0-4325-9f56-9671f6d47d7b-0
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.132
Suppose the planet decided to spin a little faster than the

2e60d82f-6db0-4325-9f56-9671f6d47d7b-1
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.850
way it's going right now.

556c5c6e-f1c5-4dc7-8a8d-22068682e74d-0
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.930
Oh, you're not going to sit here.

4451d2d1-c730-42a8-a11d-76e1646a979d-0
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.370
You'll be rolling all over the place or you'll break up.

d7ff0fae-5a02-462b-a862-e2165a9448af-0
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.379
You know this if you if you climb a mountain, if you reach a

d7ff0fae-5a02-462b-a862-e2165a9448af-1
00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:56.583
certain altitude, people get terribly sick and many of them

d7ff0fae-5a02-462b-a862-e2165a9448af-2
00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:56.930
die.

bc110477-55de-47dd-9ce0-9e55eaab7744-0
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.890
People think it's only because of oxygen.

c9b239b6-07e8-4c72-9415-bee35280d9a2-0
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.730
It's not just because of oxygen.

07cd153b-2745-4c9c-b628-3613cb873df7-0
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.810
Lack of pressure just dismantles the system in some way.

977d8f57-8abc-4d0b-89ac-0a3d9a999a1b-0
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.850
Or somebody dived into the ocean or into the waters.

249ee5ee-9560-4c8c-81de-1d4541be7ea6-0
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.060
They go beyond a certain depth, so much pressure.

27efe967-f368-439d-bf73-ae80e2581a5a-0
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.500
This will destroy the body.

f57f41cb-f9e4-490e-b6e5-110c2ddee8bd-0
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.569
So right now not one or two things, a million things are

f57f41cb-f9e4-490e-b6e5-110c2ddee8bd-1
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:25.947
maintaining and incubating you even today to be alive and to be

f57f41cb-f9e4-490e-b6e5-110c2ddee8bd-2
00:13:25.947 --> 00:13:29.140
in this state of existence, isn't it?

9819c53e-b90e-4188-8160-6d1de96fc0cf-0
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.996
So when we say alignment in yoga, we are not talking about

9819c53e-b90e-4188-8160-6d1de96fc0cf-1
00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:36.260
just physical alignment like this.

0c218855-401f-4801-b0bd-a8fdd2f762d2-0
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:42.391
We are seeing how the internal geometry and the larger geometry

0c218855-401f-4801-b0bd-a8fdd2f762d2-1
00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:44.480
in some way is In Sync.

4f965d5b-8ce9-424c-b397-6164464b0ab5-0
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.179
Suddenly this entire thing, if it operates as one machine,

4f965d5b-8ce9-424c-b397-6164464b0ab5-1
00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:53.720
which it is right now but you're not conscious of if you align it

4f965d5b-8ce9-424c-b397-6164464b0ab5-2
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.985
properly, suddenly this is a much larger life than the way it

4f965d5b-8ce9-424c-b397-6164464b0ab5-3
00:13:57.985 --> 00:13:58.880
is right now.

a516cba3-c271-4acb-bac6-996a41d3143b-0
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.292
This is what I meant when I said instead of being a piece of

a516cba3-c271-4acb-bac6-996a41d3143b-1
00:14:03.292 --> 00:14:07.055
creation, instead of being an individual, it becomes a

a516cba3-c271-4acb-bac6-996a41d3143b-2
00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:08.559
universal possibility.

390bde3a-9543-433c-ac9a-a4a1a4ca6775-0
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.350
Instead of being a piece of creation, it becomes the source

390bde3a-9543-433c-ac9a-a4a1a4ca6775-1
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.030
of creation.

22691c6e-ea9e-458f-8974-63370664ba3c-0
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:20.330
So these are very simple things simply like this, but I want you

22691c6e-ea9e-458f-8974-63370664ba3c-1
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.110
to do it like your life depends on it.

5ad9c3a0-da61-4b25-828c-3658726d45a8-0
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.790
Understand all the attention that you can muster.

d87e8728-cfef-4751-b5bf-ea6740c205bb-0
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.950
Everything that happens in your body, you must notice and do it.

d93b8644-3f67-40ca-9947-9e643c3582f0-0
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.760
And I'll be starting with the practices.

89fcde14-49c6-46b9-8fdf-e80aa0b76239-0
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.324
We'll review the practices that we have learned yesterday so you

89fcde14-49c6-46b9-8fdf-e80aa0b76239-1
00:14:44.324 --> 00:14:48.076
can take a moment to adjust your position, so you can sit

89fcde14-49c6-46b9-8fdf-e80aa0b76239-2
00:14:48.076 --> 00:14:52.346
comfortably on the floor and you have sufficient space around you

89fcde14-49c6-46b9-8fdf-e80aa0b76239-3
00:14:52.346 --> 00:14:53.640
to do the practices.

7d84adb0-c319-44d3-8d35-a83f3793436d-0
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.239
So the first practice that we learned yesterday, what was

7d84adb0-c319-44d3-8d35-a83f3793436d-1
00:14:59.239 --> 00:14:59.560
that?

b192ed7d-95e9-49a9-a745-07890048245f-0
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.760
Patangasana or Butterfly.

43d0e95e-81bc-4fd2-8f1e-b5b7591366a9-0
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.895
So we'll now look at the instructions once more, along

43d0e95e-81bc-4fd2-8f1e-b5b7591366a9-1
00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:08.290
with the demonstration.

7c9366fb-93ec-4005-b733-8c02611055d7-0
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:09.850
Please observe.

4db30bc3-0db6-4638-ae7a-f4854bbd31b2-0
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:10.770
Don't do it yet.

c3fa850d-8e49-49bd-9013-ce6c3c5c18a0-0
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.810
Just observe.

a61cb548-9f87-4fff-8a3f-8e48b8c30b7f-0
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.275
So how you do this is put the soles of your feet together,

a61cb548-9f87-4fff-8a3f-8e48b8c30b7f-1
00:15:20.275 --> 00:15:25.584
clasp your hands over your toes, close your eyes, pull your heels

a61cb548-9f87-4fff-8a3f-8e48b8c30b7f-2
00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:30.409
as close to you as possible and a little more, and wing it.

50c3a93f-bf79-4ccc-9076-9abd9c5d6960-0
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.930
Get maximum movement.

61675e9b-c266-4bde-b454-e82c01305f6e-0
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.680
The breathing is slightly deeper than normal.

c642c662-5726-493c-9dc4-1fe092c22964-0
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.600
Keep your spine erect.

912cf22d-3a4b-4886-b1ce-394f396516fe-0
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.280
You will do this for two minutes.

7fe8be33-e5e1-4352-9caa-ff94d4749a25-0
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.193
And when you do this, you should notice the maximum pressure at

7fe8be33-e5e1-4352-9caa-ff94d4749a25-1
00:15:45.193 --> 00:15:46.360
the base of the spine.

c0cf3931-0929-41ce-95b0-0abf6dfc2404-0
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.774
So now we'll look at a few common corrections for

c0cf3931-0929-41ce-95b0-0abf6dfc2404-1
00:16:03.774 --> 00:16:04.440
Patangasana.

c6383294-50ce-4c59-ab3f-34733f1e4434-0
00:16:04.960 --> 00:17:32.000
Please observe, Should we do it together?

ad67e30f-1665-43ae-bbcb-325a0f9efcb7-0
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.200
Yes.

1124daa1-d02c-4d1a-8c93-f790c76ada99-0
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.113
So those of you, if you have any medical condition or physical

1124daa1-d02c-4d1a-8c93-f790c76ada99-1
00:17:38.113 --> 00:17:42.239
injury that prevents you from doing the practice, you can sit

1124daa1-d02c-4d1a-8c93-f790c76ada99-2
00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:45.966
with your eyes closed and visualize the practice so you

1124daa1-d02c-4d1a-8c93-f790c76ada99-3
00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:49.694
can adjust yourself so that you're fully visible on the

1124daa1-d02c-4d1a-8c93-f790c76ada99-4
00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:50.160
camera.

fe5142a6-31d8-4f4f-8e2a-1a3ce7e1165f-0
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.654
If you're using headset, please take them off and switch to the

fe5142a6-31d8-4f4f-8e2a-1a3ce7e1165f-1
00:17:54.654 --> 00:17:57.840
speaker mode so they can still hear the instructions.

a63e359c-10ee-4d50-979e-0ae3410c1121-0
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.010
Those of you who are wearing glasses, please give them aside.

0fa70efd-4a2a-4af8-920a-bbcde2c37964-0
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.170
If you're wearing socks, you must take them off now.

af491998-2b8a-4318-9a76-0431ce7add8e-0
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.530
We'll be doing this together.

17d1c3cb-75cf-420a-82a0-abb188da712b-0
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.930
Put the soles of your feet together.

bb45b71a-8ad7-4722-9f9b-55bdb8cae690-0
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.570
Clasp your hands over your toes.

b27b6637-0b00-4f46-b5ee-26a7af487e01-0
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:18.930
Close your eyes.

8e5a23a6-13ac-45ea-a12b-95f86efa4dee-0
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.370
Keep your head straight.

14777cc7-2049-442b-b201-7d9d6b789ca0-0
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.690
Don't do it rapidly with slight movement.

7470cd46-01f4-4f5f-b9e1-4a3c4df8eec1-0
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.330
Do it gently with maximum movement.

9a1dcb7c-b517-41fd-b5c5-771850df01f4-0
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.230
Keep your shoulders relax.

a59f1458-98d0-42d3-a100-3f5923da6741-0

So what this means is when you bend forward or backward, you

045bdad3-a50d-480d-a846-604c03b3ef63-1
00:31:40.027 --> 00:31:43.270

So when we do nadi U bachan as we transition from one plus

5d0333c2-e415-4618-8281-b01c5c6211d0-1

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:15.260
So when you do Suka Korea, what is most important is you breathe

9a620429-c191-486c-ae98-9d5e62acf27e-1
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.870

deee63f7-ece3-4f1b-81a0-76d75c09dfd4-0
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:22.870
It must be a complete exhalation and a complete inhalation.

ed92d618-d35a-4d84-a07f-69cf9234d550-0
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:27.723

00:41:27.723 --> 00:41:28.000
you.

af14699b-b0f6-492e-9852-6eb59bf83466-0
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.213
The idea Suka chia is so gentle that if you put a feather below

af14699b-b0f6-492e-9852-6eb59bf83466-1
00:41:33.213 --> 00:41:37.203
your nostrils, the hair of the feather should not even vibrate

af14699b-b0f6-492e-9852-6eb59bf83466-2
00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:39.040
or flutter during exhalation.

08c64ac2-3187-4e96-bdc6-0e4dbf2b42ca-0
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.449
So if you cannot do it this gentle, you can do it as slowly

08c64ac2-3187-4e96-bdc6-0e4dbf2b42ca-1
00:41:43.449 --> 00:41:46.080
and as gently as it is possible for you.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.360
When you do Suka Chia you only have to remember 2 points.

2a54c6b6-0701-4ce0-9c19-61fe85413171-0

e6d2be12-86ab-494e-afcd-72e0e58c49bf-0
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.866
You do this with being absolutely absolutely conscious

e6d2be12-86ab-494e-afcd-72e0e58c49bf-1
00:42:07.866 --> 00:42:09.000
about the breath.

7d19cace-5fb9-4bc8-8d3c-69bb6b622a80-0
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.200
The Korea will not become a Korea unless unless the breath

7d19cace-5fb9-4bc8-8d3c-69bb6b622a80-1
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.240

953801ca-0505-49e5-aece-ec0f5bf6e806-0
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.160
So the mind and the breath should be like one force.

dd781348-8038-4fef-af5a-3b066df508c7-0
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.920

00:42:52.867 --> 00:42:56.038

d4fa046b-ea8b-480f-8ca8-e9de165ddd6f-0
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.839
That means whichever nostril you exhale through, same nostril you

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.741
The Kriya will not become a Kriya unless your mind and the

a05fa0c4-26c0-4796-8f70-e45d1effe05c-1
00:47:30.741 --> 00:47:32.320

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:05.421
Inhale through the nozzles and only after the inhalation is

199e0eb1-fbc2-4171-b542-5e37ccb7ffef-1
01:08:05.421 --> 01:08:09.650
complete relax your diaphragm and then relax your and a lock.

7408c253-2c08-4fb2-9497-f344ff74f3d2-0
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.860
You can slowly open your eyes.

71ccb052-097e-4e8e-86f1-e9a98bbf8993-0
01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:24.510
So when you do the bandas, don't do it repeatedly.

68fbd95c-d0f9-45c2-872f-01969b6e5a2a-0
01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:27.880
It should only happens once, once on the fullness of breath

68fbd95c-d0f9-45c2-872f-01969b6e5a2a-1
01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.550
and once on emptiness of breath.

3d0afb8b-47fc-43f1-ba5e-447627ce2498-0
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:33.070
So you might take some time for the body to cooperate.

b8b0fcf4-5889-40c0-a342-92527dbfb0ef-0
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:36.590
So please don't worry if it is not cooperating.

f790b83f-65ee-49ce-9084-b76da8cfd6e6-0
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:41.703
Until now we have been stomach has been growing this way,

f790b83f-65ee-49ce-9084-b76da8cfd6e6-1
01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:42.100
right.

75045a04-50b6-4de8-994d-b6f79a1cbd3f-0
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.380
So now we are trying to push it the other way.

c0499ee9-888e-4f72-b9ee-1d1c3aa598e5-0
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.180
So it will definitely take some time.

9210926f-59b7-4269-805a-bfc5ed1110b3-0
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:51.068
So it will, it will happens after practice, after a few

9210926f-59b7-4269-805a-bfc5ed1110b3-1
01:08:51.068 --> 01:08:54.900
after as you go with the practice, this will happen.

9b3d2554-3b61-4a79-83bc-4b2dfc3cd96d-0
01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.140
So don't, don't worry about it.

b1c6ddb4-5f10-4c55-abdb-a245d4b3d455-0
01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:56.700
Yes.

14296093-f5cf-4871-a942-088d1a016bc5-0
01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.060
So these are all the practices that we have learned so far.

71dea542-03b0-4c52-8c9c-8d1adb18ef04-0
01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.580
Now we will recap them.

1d6af9a4-f810-42f5-9b97-eae1bf55d322-0
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.381
So the first part is the preparatory Asanas for Shambhavi

1d6af9a4-f810-42f5-9b97-eae1bf55d322-1
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:06.940
Mahamudra.

a5c58f06-3e29-4ecd-9e10-ffe041ea8a53-0
01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.940
So first is Patangasana or butterfly.

a3b8818c-b0b3-42a6-b9a2-e3cb8856447c-0
01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:17.383
You do this for two minutes and then what is the next Shishupala

a3b8818c-b0b3-42a6-b9a2-e3cb8856447c-1

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.860
And the third one is Nadiwi by Chan or the cat stretch.

c95b10ac-61dd-443c-af22-9e14f69cf401-0
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.940
You do 3 cycles of Nadiwi by Chan.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.740
So these are the preparatory asanas for Shambhavi Mahamudra.

ab6e0fea-9381-4fed-b1cc-280f2c3aa0c3-0
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.620

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:53.030
for a minute or two and then you let the breath settle downs

d284f9ac-ecc9-49a1-997e-8b252ed6f8fb-2
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:54.980
before you start the Suka Kriya.

b0f47b98-2d08-4fbb-92e8-13f7ef1f4677-0

Mudra and you'll be doing arm chanting for 21 times.

e2e7d86b-ced2-4ec0-ae99-726a4c50d014-0

Mahamudra, which is the bandas.

You can simply boil water with half a handful of peppercorns,

e0006953-5f72-48c4-8fdb-f40a35a0b6e2-1
01:13:46.193 --> 01:13:50.576

this break because for the next session your system needs to be

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:54.010
This is a life process.

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:06.810
Every cell in your body has to be receptive and willing.

a3c9034d-0c65-4dc4-a215-8791927cbdae-0

01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:19.859
This is not some philosophical stuff where you learn it, you

fc077dd2-6469-4ba9-89b9-c49055e1837c-1
01:16:19.859 --> 01:16:21.760
understand it and then you do it.

4cb1a16f-4348-4cda-9540-6e5bbb48fe39-0
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.200
This is like a seed.

33e78eb4-94e6-442c-9aaf-5338f9fa8776-0
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.360

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.667
And because if there's any substance whatever, any

fc200946-12f5-46c8-bbd5-e7b8c9753155-1
01:16:48.667 --> 01:16:53.342
substance that is in the system will make you less receptive, it

fc200946-12f5-46c8-bbd5-e7b8c9753155-2
01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:57.944

9f7cd052-86fc-42d3-8548-6432d21d432f-0
01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.351
Yes, and it can also cause damage to to the system if you

9f7cd052-86fc-42d3-8548-6432d21d432f-1
01:17:03.351 --> 01:17:03.880
do this.

6c479cfd-9145-4d58-ace2-185afb7e76b9-0
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.091

So please keep aside all the possible Disturb Destructions

800aab7b-88ca-4b73-abfa-3b879c731cde-1

24fda72c-6edd-4834-9609-da5bb1ac24fd-0

Shambhavi Mahamuda Kriya has been offered for millennia,

24fda72c-6edd-4834-9609-da5bb1ac24fd-1
01:17:28.631 --> 01:17:32.380
right from the time of Adiyogi, the first Yogi.

6549d352-7ea2-4557-b01e-c99f71d20408-0
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.300
It has been transmitted to every generation.

a84304e4-1511-415c-b64d-51f1525b9e59-0
01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:42.212

prepare your system for 12
years, one solar cycle.

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:48.650
This is the prescription.

f80d90f4-cac2-4267-a8bb-0a78d4c0185c-0
01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:51.810
This is the standard prescription in India, 12 years.

348fd7e7-ded9-4c86-b148-7c0605982f3d-0
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:55.010
So from 12 years to three sessions.

3e02aaa2-7ed2-4b5c-b5e2-4f11022c8e7e-0
01:17:55.530 --> 01:18:00.025
This is only possible because there is a living guru who is

3e02aaa2-7ed2-4b5c-b5e2-4f11022c8e7e-1
01:18:00.025 --> 01:18:04.145
giving himself in many more ways that we can logically

3e02aaa2-7ed2-4b5c-b5e2-4f11022c8e7e-2
01:18:04.145 --> 01:18:04.970
understand.

01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:12.076
But if you can, But if you extend it further, if you've

8c1bc9ea-8fe7-4a02-a253-6d893358b29e-1
01:18:12.076 --> 01:18:17.986
pushed this further by taking a break, getting up, eating

8c1bc9ea-8fe7-4a02-a253-6d893358b29e-2
01:18:17.986 --> 01:18:23.284
whatever you want, or multitasking on social media,

8c1bc9ea-8fe7-4a02-a253-6d893358b29e-3
01:18:23.284 --> 01:18:25.730
then this will not work.

59419304-459a-45e7-b89b-eb34d5111bf2-0
01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:26.970

2969fee2-ca3e-46d8-aa52-b343bba7a887-0
01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:33.899
So since all of us are here now, can we give ourselves totally,

2969fee2-ca3e-46d8-aa52-b343bba7a887-1
01:18:33.899 --> 01:18:34.410
100%?

46e3bc28-d66c-4156-9c71-1d80a9705074-0
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:35.450
Is it OK?

192dc911-6788-422b-b928-d71b783e988e-0
01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:36.570
Yes.

e8304a7c-6708-430b-8f44-499145b94623-0
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:43.345
So the next session will be at
1:30 and it will be a six and a

e8304a7c-6708-430b-8f44-499145b94623-1
01:18:43.345 --> 01:18:44.790
half hour session.

8468a1dd-4ebc-4b58-931e-fff3c3708e70-0
01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:50.057

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:55.070
So there's no don't have to worry about that.

01:18:56.030 --> 01:19:00.870
And so with this, can you be totally focused to this?

bd334dc0-a220-44c2-9b38-3458e9aa80ec-0
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:07.070
Your snack, your notebook, your water bottle, everything else?

a10b8d36-4997-4567-bcad-0d7155989350-0
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:10.351
Can you keep this aside and just be focused here in the next

a10b8d36-4997-4567-bcad-0d7155989350-1
01:19:10.351 --> 01:19:10.830

before that.

fdb55604-d180-4b8f-b49c-3e3eca75956c-0
01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.780
It is best that you don't speak to anybody.

a3e1443d-1057-44c8-9b26-fb88e5014286-0
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:30.098
If if there is a need to speak one word to somebody, it is all

a3e1443d-1057-44c8-9b26-fb88e5014286-1
01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:30.540

01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:46.070
Just allow your your body, your breath should settle down.

6f88f1f2-032c-4efc-99cb-6e063b988c5a-0
01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:51.528
This will go a long way in creating the right atmosphere

6f88f1f2-032c-4efc-99cb-6e063b988c5a-1

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.480
You would have to give up your life, go in search of some guru.

62896f4a-d90a-442e-bdf2-b7940a78c7dd-0
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.383
