Where gods is like Sinamastaa, live with a person
Is it possible for Goddess, like Ginamastaa
to actually be present like that
is such a thing possible with lingamhairaviy also
Is it possible that the form could be living and moving?
Very much possible
I'm afraid to say this because
there's a whole lot of people who have no
any kind of control over their imagination
and they will start visualizing all kinds of things
and they'll lose their mental balance if they do that
In the yogic science there is a dimension of yoga called tantra yoga
in tantra one important aspect of it is
the yogis create their own dhaitis
that they create a certain form and make it alive
that form either he or she or whatever that form is
it works with the yogi all the time
so this is why he needs no company
this is why he doesn't get married
because all the time that is company
is a dimension for certain reasons
generally they created female forms
and with terrible attributes
this is not
I'm not making a statement about anything
but the yogis created these things either
because
they want
somebody next to them
to whom
you cannot be drawn because of physical beauty or something else
there is no way to be drawn
all kinds of weird images
I don't know if you have seen images of rakeni, dharkeni, chennamaste, kali
Music
these are all terrible images of feminine manifestation
but they created these kind of images
one reason is because they want it like that
another reason maybe
suppose you try to make
let's say we gave you a lump of clay
and somebody said make the image of our yogi
you know you may make him like this
not because of choice
simply because you're clumsy with your hands
possible
so for whichever reason they created
those kind of images
and these walk with them
many of these
many many of these
or
still around
the yogis are gone long time ago
they fulfill the purpose of why they created these images
but they are gone
these forms are still there
those who created some kind of lineage
there are people who still
making use of these forms
those who did not bother to create anything like that
they just let them lose
if you hit you anahata
they think a welcome bell has been struck
and they tend to come
if they come
you won't play with them
you will be terrified of them
because
if you are made like this
if somebody instead of having a nose like this
somebody had grown a nose here facing upward
looking at him you will be terrified, isn't it?
yes or no?
suppose somebody didn't have a nose just two holes
looking at him you will be terrified
when you're made like this
you should not go into anahata
because it will draw different types of forms
all these forms are created by human beings
why it is coming towards anahata is
this is the power of creation
this is where a human being can create
so once you touch the dimension
everything that's being created and left around
the subtle forms will start coming in
before art, music
and something else comes to you
these subtle forms of creation
because they are the lightest in the existence around you
they are of least inertia
they are the first ones who will come
Kali will come here
wonderful some people
spend their entire life wanting to see Kali
but you
if she comes here
even if she comes in your sleep
you will have to wash your bed tomorrow
yes
because it's happened to many people like this
people who thought they are perfectly normal
and they brave enough to go anywhere
and they want to explore this and that
just one little something
and they are finished
for life
when people want to master
a cult first thing is
you must come to terms with
other kinds of beings who don't look like you
that means they may have a
nose growing somewhere here
instead of here
or something else or something else
like all your Hollywood is trying to make up those people
everyday
you know
so some kind of stuff
doesn't look like you means weird, isn't it?
hello?
anybody who doesn't look like you is weird
so one of those
your idea of weird creatures
is Kali, Chinamasti, Daghrakini, Daghkini, Lakini, Lankini
all these kinds of people
all they start coming in
it's a wonderful opportunity
but
if your sweetness of emotion
and
a crystal razor sharp
discernment of the intellect
is not
maintained
these two things
these things can become a terrible experience
and may break your mind
you may lose your mind
completely
everyday in your dream
not even in reality
in your dream
something weird appeared
a whole lot of people will lose their mind
yes?
so before we
before anybody
goes into these type of practices
before you approach Chinamasta
of all the devis
you must at least spend
a few months in the cremation grounds
to stabilize your mind
these days they all become
crematoriums
where it all happens inside
you don't see a thing
you put somebody
that you like or you don't like into it
they just come out as just ash
you know
it's a two
two organized
you can't really see anything
but when people were burnt on firewood
it was a different matter
the entire atmosphere
would be different if you
went into a cremation ground
in India
you will see if three, four, five fires
will be burning
at different stages of burning
the smell of it, the atmosphere of it
on the weird people who inhabit
the cremation ground
it's a whole experience
I spend a whole lot of time
they are not knowing all this
but wanting to see something
well none of those guys turned up
the whole sadhana of chinnamasta
starts in the cremation grounds
because you must stabilize the
mind beyond fear, beyond
likes and dislikes, beyond
reversion, beyond any kind of
repugnance towards anything
beyond seeing what is pure
and impure, what is good and bad
simply looking at life
and death the same way
without that
chinnamasta
is going to be a very bad thing for you
even if something is good
if it arrives in your life
when you are not ready for it
it can mean something else
it doesn't look good to you
after
suppose when you are a five-year-old child
if I put a 10kg weight on your head
maybe you would get crushed
if you were an infant definitely
you would get crushed
after you have grown up
you can carry 10kg on your head
it's a different matter
chinnamasta is not for you
chinnamasta is not for people
who live in family situations
chinnamasta should never be approached
without stabilizing your mind
absolutely
that there is no fear
there is no repugnance about anything
no filth, no flavour
everything is same for you
unless you are there
you don't approach such
those dimensions of life
they will completely leave you psychologically broken
so we leave chinnamasta alone
and we have in many ways
ensured that the byravi doesn't walk your house
the next level of sadhana would be that
if you want to walk around with you
there are things to do for that
but that will need an enormously stable mind
otherwise people will go crazy
just enjoy the reverberance
enjoy the well-being that she creates for you
don't try to shake hands with her
not that she is bad
you are not good enough, that's all
so the living goddess
see if we can consecrate a stone
to become a goddess
if a human being is truly willing
why can't we consecrate a human body
to become a goddess
someone who can convert a stone into a goddess
can't he convert a woman into a goddess
or a man into a god
so all those millions of witches who were burnt
are just those women who exhibited certain qualities
which did not fit into the logic of that society
and I remember going and sitting with these ladies
generally they were all by then most of them
a few of them young ones
some of them sat naked, young ones
